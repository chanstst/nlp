    "### Further data processing\n",
    "Some further data processing is needed before fitting the inputs to vectorizers and models. Steps include:\n",
    "- lemmatizing\n",
    "- removing English stop words\n",
    "- removing additional stop words manually\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectorization\n",
    "- CounterVectorization in this current step\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modelling\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Multinomial Bayesian\n",
    "Logistic Regression was able to provide a better accuracy, around 75% in validation sets as well as test sets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Visualization\n",
    "By studying the key words effective at differentiating \"Democrats\" vs \"Republican\", some insights were derived:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Democrats\n",
    "- Democrats are more prone to mentioning \"donald\", \"trump\", \"cruz\", \"republican\", \"right wing\"\n",
    "- Due to the recent news, \"impeachment\", \"insurrection\", \"capitol\", \"resign\" are the key identifiers in Democrats' posts\n",
    "- Democrats also mention more \"democracy\" and \"inauguration\" in the posts, which seem to be what they are concerned\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conservatives\n",
    "- \"China\", \"communist\", \"leftist\" are the top words to identify the posts of Conservatives\n",
    "- \"fraud\", \"evidence\", \"ballot\" are related to recent news on election\n",
    "- Conservatives tend to talk more \"deal\", \"business\", \"tech\", \"big tech\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights from key words\n",
    "After refitting the model with the best parameters, the weightings of model coefficients were ranked and the more \"influential\" key words were examined. Comparing this list with the most common key words in the corpus, it was confirmed that the most popular words in the corpus may not be the most effectively in classification, ie the model was able to extract important key words from each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those key words are good indicators of the current political landscape in US."
