t3_ktjva7,ATTENTION  If you are here from the left or the right. DO NOT ADVOCATE VIOLENCE or for anyone to be killed. DO NOT advocate civil war or ALLUDE TO IT. This means ALL OF YOU. Left or right  we will ban you...and reddit will action your account.,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/ktjva7/attention_if_you_are_here_from_the_left_or_the/," r topmindsofreddit has linked to this submission.

We removed some abusive comments  but since the person making them linked this sub to topmindsofreddit  we are re approving the comments so that users can see how reddit be.

Reddit is a place where you go to a sub and abuse people   as an eight day old account claiming to have just  accidentally  found the submission  then link to another meta sub  that your eight day old account just ALSO  happened to come across    to talk about the responses you got to your comment and then after posting there you come back again to keep commenting... then others from the subreddit that you posted in come here to comment unapologetically saying you  deserve it .

Actually  this is pretty much the shit sundae of trying to be conservatives on reddit.

Make a post condemning violence and telling EVERYONE no matter what not to do it... get the post brigaded by another subreddit.

Funzies  Off the topic  but I m going to say it   Roombas with teeth  is one of the best things I ve read on here in a while Thank you for this  I ve noticed this too. Most of the new  conservatives  who defend the capitol riot are not actually conservatives  they re trying to get this subreddit banned  I saw people commenting in r politics about trying to do this .

Automatically ban anyone who promotes violence because chances are  the true conservatives in this group have nothing to do with the people who are advocating for the violence in the group. I freaking hate you right now. I m going to dream of roombas with teeth tonight and when I wake my kids screaming I hope somewhere out there you shiver and know you ll have my eternal enemity. Hi  I m pretty ducking liberal  but this sub doesn t seem to be a safe space like the other one  and I appreciate that .I ll try to not spam you with my filthy liberal ideas  and am mostly here to remember all the things most Americans Agree upon    just see different roads to get there Understood. Part of this overt attempt to censor is to outrage and continue to divide. It s clear we cannot divide despite considering this censorship to be incredibly dangerous. 

There will be peace and harmony as most Americans are good people. We will continue to prosper. IBiteYou 2024. Thank you for this. Thank you for this statement. Don t worry  I don t have to say I want a civil war for this subreddit to be banned  they ve already banned a few conservatives republicans subreddits  they re banning millions of conservative Twitter and FB accounts  hell even Parler is getting banned. Simple saying telling the rioters to go home and for ppl to stay peaceful was apparently enough reason to delete that tweet and ban Trump s account. It s only a matter of time b4 they ban all accounts that even suggest we want peace and hope You don t even have to say that. Admins are threatening me for this post 

https   www.reddit.com r conservatives comments ksohfs blmba wishes more women were shot and killed 

I did not support violence in that post in any way. Nor can I argue the point with them in a reply.

They are just making up whatever they want to. Could everyone  instead of calling for fucking violence  just let us all try to be AMERICANS AGAIN  Try MOVING ON  

I m sick of all of you. Left  right  center  I m done. It s an embarrassment being on this land with you bastards.

Edit for clarity before people make assumptions  I popped in on r popular sorted by Rising. I just came across it. I am not a conservative  a liberal  a progressive  an authoritarian  nothing. I am one of many trying to get by while every side of the country implodes and ruins everyone s lives. What do we do if we have a tyrannical government that completely overlooks our constitution  and takes away human rights from its citizens  slowly  but surely  We let it happen   D Saying that the protesters should face justice is not inciting violence imo.  The guys who brought the bombs should face high punishemnents.

However I don t believe that the police should have killed everyone at the protest. Hi  if you want parler for Android click on this  Https   company.parler.com android parler release.apk fuck google and their censoring.  Do not come here and say   All you fucking conservatives need to hang for sedition.

I SO MUCH agree with this. But also don t come here and say  

Do not come here and say   All fucking democrats need to hang. 

Do not say   Bullets need to rain down on you Democrat traitors .

Can t we all just live in peace like it was before fuckin  social media and internet feel good bubbles  How did people engage in political intercourse before the bloody internet  This shouldn t have to be said. Bite me pls uwu I m already banned. Don t say reddit is run by left wing nut cases Except liberals can say this in politics and it s all fine and good.  roombas with TEETH 

Well  that s a very unique way of putting it... Can t we all just get along All those flaired accounts posting in  flaired users only  threads are a false flag attack  Come on  man...

r Thisisntwhoweare","I mean it... Goddamn it.

Do not come here and say   All you fucking conservatives need to hang for sedition. 

Do not say   Bullets need to rain down on you Republican traitors .

Do not come here and say   It s time for civil war. 

This is OUR subreddit and we WILL do our best to ensure that reddit doesn t have a valid reason to shut it down.

Some of you  righties  coming to talk about wanting civil war or insurrection are people we have NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

And you started this JUST as the events in DC happened.

We know what false flags are. If you say things here that will get our subreddit actioned by the admins  we ll ban you AND REPORT YOU TO THEM.

We have NEVER had a problem with this here before and it will not start now.

Our mods are active...like roombas with TEETH... and we will PUT a quick stop to any advocacy of violence here."
t3_kv5nyw,Exactly Where and How Did Trump Incite the Mob ,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/kv5nyw/exactly_where_and_how_did_trump_incite_the_mob/," gt  The Dodgy Timeline.

 gt  And while the Washington Post clumsily attempts to blame President Trump for the violence   despite the President calling for  peaceful  protests and the  cheering on  of Congressmen   their own article admits the  first wave of protesters arrived at the Capitol about 12 40pm. 

 gt  President Trump s speech didn t conclude until 1 11pm  and with at least a 45 minute walk between the two locations with crowd related delays  that would put the first people from Trump s speech at Capitol Hill no earlier than 1 56pm   a full hour and sixteen minutes after troublemakers arrived.

 gt  In fact  rioters who breached the perimeter would have had to leave before Trump s speech even began  at 12pm precisely  to make it in time for the events as they are detailed by authorities.

 gt  The Washington Post also states   Sund s outer perimeter on the Capitol s west side was breached within 15 minutes   meaning the Capitol was breached over an hour before Trump speech attendees could have even begun to arrive.

 gt  This correlates with Sund s interview  where he admits   I realized at 1pm  things aren t going well  I m watching my people getting slammed. 

 gt  Again  1pm would have been a full 56 minutes before any Trump speech attendees could have begun arriving  let alone breaching the perimeter and clashing with police. Downtown Washington  D.C. roads were closed. There was no way of arriving faster  let alone before the President had finished speaking.

 gt  At 1 09pm  still before the President had finished speaking  Sund called the Sergeants at arms of the House and Senate. He told them it was time to call in the National Guard. He even said he wanted an emergency declaration. Both  however  said they would  run it up the chain  and get back to him.

 gt  At 1 50pm the Capitol itself was breached. Still before most Trump speech attendees could have arrived.

 gt  What happened after this point was a back and forth over hours between D.C. officials  Army officials  and Capitol police.

 gt  Eventually   at past 5pm   the National Guard arrived.

 gt  And while Sund is quoted in the Washington Post as blaming President Trump s speech for the violence that ensued   the timeline means that makes no sense.

 gt  The President s fans are not known for leaving his speeches 5 or 10 minutes in. And by the time the Capitol was breached  those who had stayed to listen to even the first 15 minutes would not have even made it there in time. Twitter wrote a rambling explanation trying to make the case that  I will not be attending the inauguration  is a call for violence. Sounded even crazier than anything Alex Jones has ever said.

https   blog.twitter.com en us topics company 2020 suspension.html For years now the fascists on the left have been looking very hard to make Republicans their targeted class. I say  targeted class  because that just tends to be the case with those sort of regimes  to make sure there is some identified class of people they can identify as causing all of their ills and then grab power in part by way of attacking this class.

Attacking Republicans in general never really worked. A lot of  racists   and  nazis   and  sexists    but it never really stuck so well because of moderates who swung both ways as well as the attacks never really making much sense in the first place.  You re racist because you don t support dividing people by race  doesn t really jive with common sense.

After so long  and especially after these four years  they finally have their moment and their specific target. It doesn t really stick when you actually look into it  but this is the best chance they ve had in so long that they re going to go with it one way or another. And the timing is certainly right  with basically every means of communication being controlled by left that any sort of  The left is being stupid  argument is just never going to be heard by the masses. Is the average person going to hear from the Right on reddit  Nope  that s basically all been banned and moderated away. Fox News  Oh  they re already saying Fox News should be banned. Twitter  Obviously not. Youtube  Those voices have already been demonetized. General internet  Not with Google in charge. And as fascists will do  once they silence the biggest voice  they ll go after the next biggest after that. 

And as I said  they also have their specific target  Trump supporters. It s a very specific and targeted group. This sub is filled with page after page of examples of Trump supports already having been punished for the crime of being a Trump supporter.

The other day a U.S. Representative called on all Republicans to be removed from office. AOC and others have called on social media to keep a list of their users who have supported Trump. 

It doesn t matter much just what Trump did or didn t say. It also doesn t matter that the left has been complete hypocrites for their words and actions now compared to the BLM riots. Obviously  nobody on the left is looking to have a spirited conversation about it all. This is their best opportunity because they re already in control of everything.

I only expect further efforts over the next two years to silence Conservatives even further. And why not  Who s going to stop them  Democrat politicians have always been much much better at being unified than Republicans  so even with that even split in the Senate  I expect there will be a LOT of pressure on any moderate Democrats to stay in line. Don t recall his name  but there is one democrat senator who has always said he will not vote for Puerto Rico and D.C. statehood  nor would he vote to pack the Court. And just yesterday he said he was reconsidering his position. Gee  you think maybe there was an important committee appointment on the line 

We re heading down a very dark path. Never did. Yet there s videos and tweets of democrats inciting the BLM Antifa mobs

 If you see any member of that cabinet in public shopping or at the gasoline station you get out there and you get in their faces and you push back. You tell them they are not welcome here or anywhere . Maxine Waters This is the start of the gaslighting. Because they think it ll win them some elections.

Even the event itself wasn t that violent besides protestors themselves getting hurt. They basically walked in because police allowed them. You don t need him to out and say  Go and attack the Capitol  it s been 6 7 weeks of hyping everyone up about election fraud. It was Giuliani that wanted  Trial of combat  It s been 4 years of non stop insanity. Twice a week this guy does something crazy that pushes the crazyness he did last week into old news and nobody can keep up. He throws these wild statements out and before anyone can fact check him he s bumbled off to the next thing he can fuck up royally. The incomplete transcript conveniently left out the part where he says
  if you don t fight like hell your not gonna have a country anymore 

If you are gonna defend trump then post the whole speech   otherwise you are fake news Last 4 minutes of the speech. He said  and we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don t fight like hell  you re not going to have a country anymore .

https   m.youtube.com watch v lBH7ql34Ex0 Liberal logic  they all ran top speed to get there  I ll start by saying I don t think Twitter and Facebook made the right call here for a bunch of reasons but that s a large discussion.

The bigger point is that the president and a group of like minded senators and house reps are perpetuating a lie that is threatening to undercut our democracy and has already destabilized our society. Trump made up the election fraud allegation because he is a preposterously sore looser and is used to getting what he wants by steamrolling through the impediment. Hopefully he met his match with American Democracy. 

Based on this preplanned  list ditch effort  Cruz and Hawley lead the charge on the senate floor under guise of  answering the questions that their constituents want answered  because they will both run in 2024.  They are a  working to inherit trumps base because they believe that part of the electorate can get them at least the republican nomination and b  appeasing trump the man because there is a good chance he will stay have a lot of sway in the republican establishment. The house reps are following suit because they will likely loose their seats  now that their increasingly radicalized constituents see their beloved leader doing this  if they don t follow Trump and the Cruz   Hawley team into the abyss.

As Mitt Romney  he used to be a hero around here  said on the senate floor directly at Hawley hours after the riot  leaders in those positions of power need to do the right thing and tell their electorates the truth.

I say all of that because I want to implore you to come up one level and think about the bigger picture. Please put real respect for the democratic process above your love for one political leader. It s the only way out of this. Thanks for posting this  He never did. It is a contrived narrative of rhe left. He didn t.  The leftist media makes shit up and sadly there are a lot of naive people out there They know he didn t. This is a power grab by the left.  removed  it s not just in one day. It s been an accumulation of what he s said and done. If you ve tolerated or ignored these in the past  I doubt any argument will convince you. This is very sad but hey  it s America.

 https   www.vox.com 21506029 trump violence tweets racist hate speech  https   www.vox.com 21506029 trump violence tweets racist hate speech 

 Trump urged the crowd to march on the Capitol  even promising to go with them  though he didn t in the end. He said    you ll never take our country back with weakness  .  Trump s words followed a speech by his personal lawyer  Rudy Giuliani  in which the former New York City mayor said     Let s have trial by combat  .  

Remember  rhetoric is very powerful bcos it doesn t have to be direct.

Trump s tweets and statements after the terrorist attack even empathized with the terrorists.

Although the case may not be strong enough for an indictment  I strongly believe Triump intentionally incited the mob and still has no remorse.",

Just a thought  before you talk about your own platforms... let s eliminate the domestic terrorism support and brainworm Qanon crap in the GOP.  Just a few thoughts from a lifelong conservative who thinks you all have lost your damn minds. It s important to note that there were a lot of terrible threats of violence that were being made on Parler that were not being moderated. While the umbrella of it all signals that its conservative censorship  conservative voices also need to focus on the fact there were plenty of terrible things being said on the platform. If that s the standard to moderate by then fine. No one should defend  organize  or threaten violence for political means or otherwise ever. Then  however  this needs to be the standard for all to follow when the Ayatollah advocates for genocide as an example or when death threats are made against any voice on these platforms  etc. etc. etc. The question is  how can we all find a way to reconcile and agree to a set of principles that everyone can use to declare something is wrong to say or do regardless of where that person s political affiliation is  Terrorist,

The times we live in when an existence that has accomplished so much can be overlooked at the swipe of a thumb. Doesn t he have a press briefing room  He can do a press conference anytime he wants. How is that silencing him  The social media platforms are private  non state owned companies . Trump can hold press briefings and release statements. The first presidential tweet was is 2015. He can just walk to his podium and start talking.

Now Stripe and Salesforce Are Cutting Off Trump and Restricting the RNC

So now  the WSJ is reporting that Stripe has cut off the ability of the Trump campaign to process payments for President Donald Trump s campaign website and online fundraising apparatus. The report claims Stripe is cutting off the president s campaign account for violating its policies against  encouraging violence.  


The Trump Campaign uses Exact Target  which is an email marketing firm owned by Salesforce and the emails are sent in conjunction with the Republican National Committee. Salesforce now says they took  action  to  prevent its use of our services in any way that could lead to violence.

t3_kv3066,So True,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/kv3066/so_true/,"You re right  if one of the unarmed protesters shot on camera had been black  there would be global riots  They d absolutely be treated differently.

It would be portrayed as  storming of the Bastille  May 2  1967  two dozen black panthers  armed with rifles and shotguns  storm the US capitol  They were treated very difrently indeed  no shots fired at all  no deaths or injuries. It s already been forgotten that DC was setting up fences and barriers on Election Day to prepare for riots if trump won... 

that was like 2 years ago. I m honestly hating the democrat hypocrisy. It used to be just liberals  but now it s the  entire  left. Yeah  they would have. They would have been allowed to establish residency and call it the Capital Hill Autonomous Zone. This isn t even a what if.

The left stormed the capital and essentially held people hostage during the Kavanaugh hearings.

I don t recall hearing a peep from big tech  the media  any democrat politician or anyone on the left about how that was a terrorist attack or how it was an attempted coup and I certainly don t recall one of them getting murdered in cold blood. Instead of having the police open the gates and having ANTIFA provocateurs urging people to go on a guide tour through the Capitol building  BLM would have smashed through the gates and burned down half of DC  let alone the Capitol building. Pelosi would put out a Buffet in the House And the police would have been withheld by Democrat governors mayors to let rioting occur  inflicting  2 billion in property damage . And they d get to create their own little autonomous zone playground in Seattle. Yes. Because those principles are worth standing up for. This is not a contest. One side is standing up for the fact that all humans have value  and the other is trying to unseat democracy. There is no contest between the two. This sentiment cannot be stressed enough  for the simple reason that the others  with their heads in their behinds  will continually screech the opposite of what s obviously true to the rest of us. This couldn t be any truer. Trying to be as centric as possible  this is one of the major problems our country has right now  one side can do it but the other can t. 

Both BLM riots and what happened in DC were domestic terrorism and should be handled the same. You can t just slap a social justice guise on and go riot. I m not disputing this. But what Trump said and did concerning election results is an entirely different issue than media bias. I am also tired BOTH sides attempting to pigeon hole the other.

Every time I say the Capitol riot was an embarrassment  someone on here or on r centrist says   WHAT ABOUT BLM   What did you say about BLM    Actually  I said those riots were also wrong. If others didn t  take it up with them

Yes  CHAZ was wrong. Looting and arson in BLM riots were wrong. But I am asking everyone on r conservative to at least say that trying to steal an election for months was a horrible  anti democratic thing to do. It led to a riot  even if Trump didn t incite it  in which people were killed  America lost standing  security flaws were possibly exposed and propaganda was provided to nations hostile to the U.S.

Can t anyone just admit some of the Republicans have acted abysmally  They were treated differently  cops shot them at their protests and only shot one woman in DC. So True   You mean like the tear gas and rubber bullets the blm protesters were greeted with  This is the stupidest fucken take I ve heard all week  removed  You re so close to grasping it...

Yes. They would support it. Because it s the right thing to do. 

Protesting against the injustice of a long history of well documented  racially motivated police murder is not the same as attempting to overthrow a democratically elected government based on election fraud claims which are supported by absolutely no evidence. 

They have been thrown out by nearly every judge  even Trump appointees. They are false claims and he attempted to stop the certification of votes and illegally disenfranchise 81 million Americans by force. 

It is terrorism. Insurrection. Treason. Sedition. 

Not protest. Damn fucked up to admit you know everyone dislikes you Just amazing. Some of you really just do not get it. how many cops died during the blm protests 

edit  were beaten to death    removed  The point being... there would be a lot more blood. The BLM protestors would not have made it inside the capitol building. If BLM was protesting at the Capitol  then the police force would have been sufficiently prepared to prevent them from storming in. Yeah they would because the protesters would have been tear gassed into oblivion if they tried anything close to that. Remember when they all got gassed and shot by rubber bullets for simply being in Washington DC ... Pepperidge farm remembers. False equivalency",

A redditor was losing an argument here  so they decided to post a comment over at  r LeopardsAteMyFace.  It s easy enough for them to find the post because they will just hit the user s name and come here.  So if you see extra traffic  it ll be a brigade from there.  I m sure we ll likely have others link to this because pointing out that the Biden Administration  who pledged to want to heal  is coming in HOT with really divisive policy is something that the left won t want to acknowledge. Clearly White supremacist Joe Biden thinks that white owned businesses are superior and don t need any help.... either that or he just really doesn t like white people. The intersectional radical left is quite open about their intentions. They want to discriminate against white Americans to somehow create equity. At its core a racist concept. Wooh wooh this is state sponsored racism it s ok Oh you didn t know  You can t be racist towards white people apparently in other words  no white owned businesses were affected Wow...this is nuts  I am not white and find this insane  It isn t racist when it s progressive yo. Also white people are the devil haven t you heard  He didn t mention straight  white males. So he gets a pass  right  If that isn t racism idk what is. I swear to god  if one illegal immigrant gets the vaccine before every American citizen has gotten theirs I m going to lose it. I ve already lost it but lose it even more. Judging from Biden s track record  I m not surprised. It s not racism if it s against white people. We re the ONLY ones who can be racist     Haven t you had your sensitivity training      I don t think this can be overstated  

THERE IS NO  OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT ELECT . They literally just made that up. So... white small owned will be screwed  Lol Uhhhh I think the Asian community is doing okay lol They hate us I m so glad to know that since I m white  it s impossible for me to face hardship 

What wonderful news  Life will be so easy  and I will do nothing except rely on my very much so existent white privilege to guide me through life     This one From UN 1963 should do

And because of that joe biden as it seems wants to basically foster theme up to the same levl as white people wich would pretty much end the last and longest cause of systemic racism in the usa
But im sure you fellow white people wont be forgotten
Im sure you are happy that black people are given the opportunity to elevate their social rank to the same as the standard white guy you you all have the same starting point as im also sure that joe will be trying something to help poor white guys Being conservative. If you re a conservative then you are not oppressed  no matter what happens. Yeah they are focussing on them because BLM and Antifa destroyed a ton of minority  owned businesses in a bunch of major cities. Let s be real  there isn t a definition of racism at this point. But this would qualify by any legitimate standard My husband is a small business owner  its a small nitch buisness that was growing steadily for years  but this year has been a hudge struggle. We are well aware at this point that Biden will not be doing anything to help  us. It d literally just be easier to say that we are prioritizing all but businesses owned by white guys The  good  racism   I m not conservative. But I approve your criticism. And if he ever eff s this up i m with you. But for now i believe he has good intentions and actual plans that will be put into action. Probably Not everyone s gonna like it even the ones he voted for him. Making sure the White Mob pays the same price for their terrorist actions much like other mobs. I m a progressive and I believe this comment is just fine.  There is no reason to assume that Biden will ignore all white people that would just be insane especially since they make up 59  of the party.

Biden s priority will be blacks and Hispanics..... for prison.  Always has been. With the continued support of the schools and big business the political system will be able to lower the self esteem of whites as they have successfully done with  blacks. As with the black leaders we will be seeing  white leaders standing on national stages telling white people they are worthless and need government to think and provide  for them. The BLM Movement and the Critical Race Theorists have done far more to promote racism than the tiny amount of white supremacists still in existence could have ever dreamed of accomplishing.  Now everyone is thinking about race issues constantly  making it difficult for people to think of each other as individuals  but instead as possessing a racial identity. Quote in context 

 gt  Our focus will be on small business that aren t wealthy and well connected  that are facing real economic hardships through no fault of their own. Our priority will be Black  Latino  Asian  and Native American owned small business  women owned businesses  and finally having  equal access  to resources needed to reopen and rebuild. But we re going to make a concerted effort to help small businesses in low income communities in big cities  small towns  rural communities  that have faced systemic barriers to relief.

To paraphrase  his stated priorities are 

1. To focus on struggling small businesses
2. To prioritize equal access to resources for minority owned businesses
3. To help businesses in low income communities Look as a progressive I hate rhetoric like this because its just conservative ammunition and gives fuel to the irrational belief that democrats want to destroy white people or something. Why you may hear democrats talk like this sometimes is that on average POC tend to be worse off then white people. This is not to say that white people have not been having a hard time. After all Biden didn t say  we need 2000 checks.... except white people.   removed ",

It forces Republicans in congress to either set themselves up to be relentlessly accused of condoning the worst parts of the attack violence on the capitol or condemn the most central figure to their party and voters  Trump .

Plus  they may believe some prominent republicans in congress who are most aligned with Trump and his voters have the most to gain by preventing him from being able to run against them in the 2024 primaries. Some may believe they ll put up a half hearted fight due to that conflict of interest.

It was written with close input from military leaders  FSB and others in the Russian political establishment. It s goal was to advance  the battle for the world rule of Russians . Several key ideas were presented throughout 

1. Germany should be advanced as the main political leader of Europe  Moscow Berlin Axis 

2. UK should be cut off from the EU

3. Ukraine should be annexed by Russia

4. Iran should be strengthened and turned against western allies  Moscow Tehran axis 

5. Turkey needs to be destabilized through fomenting minority unrest

6. China should be as much as possible dismantled by fomenting dissent in HK  and more importantly fomenting problems with Uighurs  Tibet  and to offset this by encouraging China towards the south china sea  and allowing them to take over  or influencing SE Asia and Australia as compensation. Mongolia should be  absorbed  by Russia

7. Most importantly to spread and amplify Anti American feelings everywhere  in particular 

 gt  Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism  for instance  provoke  Afro American racists . Russia should  introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity  encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic  social and racial conflicts  actively supporting all dissident movements   extremist  racist  and sectarian groups  thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics

This is good. We need to start our own wiki system to fully document this stuff so we can just link it when the nonbelievers ask The double standard is astounding. 

The media and democrats can t even see past they re own hypocrisy. Riots are wrong. Both the left and right shouldn t be doing it. Period. 

Media outlets are saying riots are the voice of the people. That s true. Who do these protestors want their voices heard to  The highest positions in the government possible. 

What s the outcome if those in the highest positions are being rioted though  Broken government. Nobody needs that. All riots are wrong and stupid. 

And i agree you are right with at least one thing. Mainstream Media shouldn t be too lenient on the left either with innocent sounding titles for their articles. I m gonna go off topic but the capital building is funded by tax payers. And who gives a fuck they trash a politicians work place. They are all such hypocrites. Violence is wrong  regardless of which side you re on. The left sure can t say the same. Edit for spelling I do not support the actions of those who entered the Capitol violently or did violence while inside.  But I will say without reservation that the reaction by the media  tech firms  Democrats and some Republicans is causing way more damage to this country than the rioters ever had the capability to do.  Conservatives must organize  and must make noise loud enough to be heard despite the supression of our voices. I actually agree that rioting can be the best action to take sometimes  like during the buildup to the American Revolution. However  the BLM riots were attacking innocent civilians with a premise based on lies  and the capitol hill storming had violence towards cops and vandalism that was completely unnecessary to their end goal of threatening the government. Objectively going in the capital was wrong but I support it because of this  hypocrisy. And make no mistake they were always gonna find something to use against us for framing so I m not letting the optics bother me. Truth hurts I havent heard anyone bring this up 

Maybe  JUST MAYBE the storming of capital hill was about a group of people so tired of being censored  disenfranchised and lied to that they assembled and protested.

There are 1000s of examples of voter fraud and non led anywhere  yeah right. Not even one 

That the big media companies all fall on one side of  Censorship is okay  These people are terrible  

And drooling dentheads everywhere applaud this draconian shit.

Perspective is everything  these men and women were wrong to storm the Capital but feelings that produced this riot will not subside with the silencing of its spokesman. Not a coup  didn t involve the military or was not directed at the executive branch. Trump was  is and will be to end of the month President. You can not have a coup d etat to keep yourself in power. This was a riot produced by frustration in the collapse of a trusted electoral system. just dont stoop. That is their entire goal. We are Wilson. Do not bow. Do not fight fire with fire.

Radiate your light bubble and be with Him. Do not stoop. Let the jackasses have the big cities  I m calling for a retreat to keep the suburbs red. Hold the line  Rioting to kill members of congress and overturn a lawful election and rioting to advocate for changes to the police are very different. As I understand it BLM is not about violence or anti democracy but the capitol riot was. Also all throughout history social unrest occasionally leads to rioting.  And say you and your friends get 5 000 people together to march for something and then 50 random people decide to go loot target. What do you do about that  That s not your fault. The point of the BLM protest was not to hang the VP it was to advocate for the US to change police. It wasn t a riot  it was an attempt to overthrow the gov t. At what point does a bunch of pipe bombs  a cooler full of molotovs  zip ties to take hostages  a dead security guard and a truck full of rifles in front of the litteral symbol of democracy turn a riot into an insurrection  Antifa people in trump costumes. 
  Some regular crowd got excited and followed behind.
The end.  deleted  There s a large difference here  and I m going to be preaching to an audience of people who are probably going to tear my argument down viciously  but to those who are willing to read  thank you and here goes.

Rioting is never good. I ll start by saying that. Whether rioting in the Capitol or rioting in cities across America  destroying private or public property should always be the last effort put forward to pursue change  not the first  and those who riot should understand that there will be consequences for their actions. With that being said  every riot happens for a reason  and regardless of whether you think rioting is good or bad  you need to look at the reason behind a riot to determine whether or not the rioting is justified or unjustified.

In the case of the George Floyd riots  we saw rioters who were upset at a system that routinely kills black people at a higher rate than whites  and allows the perpetrators of these killings to walk away free while the system as a whole that empowered these perpetrators goes without any meaningful reform or punishment for their actions. While there certainly were riots  it is obvious that the wide majority of people who took to the streets this summer were not rioters but instead protestors. These protestors were lumped in with the rioters all the same  were met with excessive brutality and arrested as if they were violent  when in many instances they were not. There is video evidence that supports this  I know of a twitter thread that can you show dozens of instances in which peaceful protestors were met with excessive force  I ll try to find it and link it later as I m at work.

Furthermore  these riots were an offshoot of the main goal of the protests. While there certainly were many rioters who were disgruntled people of color  a large percentage were also whites who were angry or just wanted to ride the wave and use it as an excuse to commit acts of violence. ANTIFA agitators were documented to have turned many protests into riots in cities across the country.

While rioting is still  bad  we can see that there is a very understandable reason behind these riots. Police brutality and the disparity at the rate at which it occurs between races is well documented  well known  and if you want to try and argue against that  then you are too far gone for me to even try to appeal to you.

The rioting that occurred at the Capitol was not an ugly offshoot of an otherwise legal movement  it was entirely paralegal in its inception and execution. Rudy Guiliani encouraged violenced explicitly  Trump and his family encouraged it implicitly  and every Republican who has provided support to the absolutely baseless claims that this election was marred by widespread fraud is partially responsible. If you want to argue that fraud was present  again  you re too far gone for me to try to appeal to.

There were no  peaceful protesters  at the Capitol. There was no just cause that they fought for. And while the actions of rioters in this summer certainly endangered the lives of many  the wide majority of those who protested didn t do so with the intent of causing bodily harm to anybody. These rioters at the capital brought fire arms  pipe bombs  zip ties  built gallows  cheered for the death of Mike Pence  and looked to kill Nancy Pelosi. The difference here is truly night and day.

Furthermore  they did so for entirely different causes. One was to fight back against inequality  the other was to undermine an election. When you see these articles  they are asking the question of  what can we change to prevent rioting in the future.  For the ones that occurred over the summer the answer is simple  reform or criminal justice system. For the one that occurred just this past week  the answer is also simple  remove from power those who incite violence and perpetuate dangerous misinformation. Its disingenuous to compare violence in response to a losing an election with violence in response to murder by police. Context matters. Police killing inocent civilians.. or Trump loosing an election fair and square. Gosh it s almost as if the riots during the BLM protest had a reason to riot  ya know  like video documentation of police murdering a man in broad daylight. The only thing the maga cult had to protest was losing a fair election. Yeah.. but none of that happened inside the Capitol building. And police response was always extreme.",

I think the real motivation is to get Republicans to vote one way or the other for or against impeachment  causing division in the Republican Party.  Those who vote against impeachment can have support for Trump used against them in future elections and could alienate moderate and independent voters.  Those who vote for it will piss off much of the base and risk getting primaried.

They also love to talk about how we should have more government just like European countries  but suddenly they side with corporate monopolies over regulation  while straw manning and saying conservatives are for NO government anarchy... As if we aren t allowed to advocate for ANY legislation because  I thought you were for no regulation.  Yeah...apparently conservatives are anarchists who aren t allowed to regulate anything  or else we are hypocrites. Never mind the fact that theres a huge difference between wanting less regulation and none at all. Hahaha  I need more popcorn. Let me inform you about situation in Europe. The situation regarding the monolithic MSM in Europe is very dire. People receive only extremely filtered information about what s actually going on in the US. What arrives in Europe is distorted and preapproved by MSM. Only a tiny minority read original us right wing sources. Therefore 95  know nothing except Trump is very bad  orange and also bad Hmm they finally realizing if they dont you big techs line that they will be next  China owned FORBES is not happy about it Well shit on me.

Who ever wrote this has summed up the mess this country is in.
Well said Unknown Author.

 This morning  I realized that everything is about to change. No matter how I vote  no matter what I say  lives are never going to be the same.

I have been confused by the hostility of family and friends. I look at people I have known all my life so hate filled that they agree with opinions they would never express as their own. I think that I may well have entered the Twilight Zone.

You can t justify this insanity. We have become a nation that has lost its collective mind.

We see other countries going Socialist and collapsing  but it seems like a great plan to us.

Somehow it s un American for the census to count how many Americans are in America.

People who say there is no such thing as gender are demanding a female President.

Universities that advocate equality  discriminate against Asian Americans in favor of African Americans.

Some people are held responsible for things that happened before they were born  and other people are not held responsible for what they are doing right now.

Criminals are caught and released to hurt more people  but stopping them is bad because it s a violation of THEIR rights.

People who have never owned slaves should pay slavery reparations to people who have never been slaves.

After legislating gender  if a dude pretends to be a woman  you are required to pretend with him.

It was cool for Joe Biden to  blackmail  the President of Ukraine  but it s an impeachable offense if Donald Trump inquiries about it.

People who have never been to college should pay the debts of college students who took out huge loans for their degrees.

Immigrants with tuberculosis and polio are welcome  but you d better be able to prove your dog is vaccinated.

Irish doctors and German engineers who want to immigrate to the US must go through a rigorous vetting process  but any illiterate gang bangers who jump the southern fence are welcomed.

 5 billion for border security is too expensive  but  1.5 trillion for  free  health care is not.

If you cheat to get into college you go to prison  but if you cheat to get into the country you go to college for free.

And  pointing out all this hypocrisy somehow makes us  racists  

Nothing makes sense anymore  no values  no morals  no civility and people are dying of a Chinese virus  but it is racist to refer to it as Chinese even though it began in China.

We are clearly living in an upside down world where right is wrong and wrong is right  where moral is immoral and immoral is moral  where good is evil and evil is good  where killing murderers is wrong  but killing innocent babies is right.

Wake up America. The great unsinkable ship Titanic America has hit an iceberg  is taking on water and sinking fast. They knew  everyone knew this was coming.  

Capitol police were sacrificed  plain and simple.  Just who was responsible for that  is also responsible for the deaths. The hypocrisy of the Left is so ridiculously blatant. For example  they now feign outrage over the death of a Capitol police officer  yet for 9 months they battled police in the streets and screamed for police defunding.  There was no  storming  of the Capitol building. There was a peaceful rally. There was a largely peaceful protest that was marred by some bad acts by a very few people 

This is what dems have been trying to shove down out throats while CITIES BURNED all summer long. But when there s a couple hundred dollars in property damage  one casualty  and the protestors stand PROTECTING the police  suddenly every conservative in the nation should be hunted down   put on a list  as AOC wants.

Edit  grammar Did you not see the cop dragged into a crowd and beaten with an American flag  Defended the fuck out of him  huh  A cop got beaten to death.  gt  The Dodgy Timeline.

 gt  And while the Washington Post clumsily attempts to blame President Trump for the violence   despite the President calling for  peaceful  protests and the  cheering on  of Congressmen   their own article admits the  first wave of protesters arrived at the Capitol about 12 40pm. 

 gt  President Trump s speech didn t conclude until 1 11pm  and with at least a 45 minute walk between the two locations with crowd related delays  that would put the first people from Trump s speech at Capitol Hill no earlier than 1 56pm   a full hour and sixteen minutes after troublemakers arrived.

 gt  In fact  rioters who breached the perimeter would have had to leave before Trump s speech even began  at 12pm precisely  to make it in time for the events as they are detailed by authorities.

 gt  The Washington Post also states   Sund s outer perimeter on the Capitol s west side was breached within 15 minutes   meaning the Capitol was breached over an hour before Trump speech attendees could have even begun to arrive.

 gt  This correlates with Sund s interview  where he admits   I realized at 1pm  things aren t going well  I m watching my people getting slammed. 

 gt  Again  1pm would have been a full 56 minutes before any Trump speech attendees could have begun arriving  let alone breaching the perimeter and clashing with police. Downtown Washington  D.C. roads were closed. There was no way of arriving faster  let alone before the President had finished speaking.

 gt  At 1 09pm  still before the President had finished speaking  Sund called the Sergeants at arms of the House and Senate. He told them it was time to call in the National Guard. He even said he wanted an emergency declaration. Both  however  said they would  run it up the chain  and get back to him.

 gt  At 1 50pm the Capitol itself was breached. Still before most Trump speech attendees could have arrived.

 gt  What happened after this point was a back and forth over hours between D.C. officials  Army officials  and Capitol police.

 gt  Eventually   at past 5pm   the National Guard arrived.

 gt  And while Sund is quoted in the Washington Post as blaming President Trump s speech for the violence that ensued   the timeline means that makes no sense.

 gt  The President s fans are not known for leaving his speeches 5 or 10 minutes in. And by the time the Capitol was breached  those who had stayed to listen to even the first 15 minutes would not have even made it there in time. ...say what  You might influence me to accept that a whole lot of people were there to peacefully protest and were later surprised to hear about the riot  but on the western side the cops were in a battle for somewhere around ninety minutes. To believe what this guy is saying  a person would have to refrain from checking  any other source at all.  Honestly some of the most amazing word play to sum this up that I have seen recently.  Love it. Don t believe your eyes or ears. Sorry rallying and protest all you d like. Raiding the capital  raiding stores etc it s not only extremely wrong  but it s also incredibly stupid. The less intelligent have been gaslit    Is that a word  other way didn t look right  For a while now. It s a liberal s defining characteristic. True  I was there and it s not what they re saying it was  Also  Emel729   great summary. Could not agree more  In the least it was poor decision making to rush the capitol  however  the blatant use of the term  domestic terrorists  and  seditionists  by the media and Biden s rhetoric regarding a racial element in all of this is both a blatant lie and completely morally apprehensible  I watched all the streams  nothing bad ever really happened except for protestors getting hurt.

It d be like if BLM was walking chanting through the wal mart  that would ve been fine and the media would ve said they were  brave  I guess he didn t see the video of the cop crying out in agony for what seemed like ages as he was crushed by the mob. In the video he didn t immediately die and there was no visible blood but hearing his screams and seeing him be crushed made my skin crawl more than any horror movie I have ever watched. I just kept holding my breath hoping the mob would stop and let him move before it was too late.",

1  Conservatices gleefully beat a cop to death but okay

1  This is spam

1  It threatens violence or physical harm at someone else We re literally watching them rewrite history. This whole thing is very eye opening. Every conservative in America is to blame for 1 protest riot  while completely overlooking the last 7 months of utter destruction. 

I know reddit does not show the whole picture of everyone s views opinions  but anyone condemning Jan 6 without condemning every BLM antifa protest riot is insane. 

I have not seen a single person condone what happened at the Capital on either side of the aisle. I also have not seen a single democrat condemn the violence perpetrated by the left since June. 

But we re the hypocrites   Dems   But  but  but . . . they have insurance  But guys  the summer riots and destruction were in the name of anti fascism.

And the censorship of conservatives on social media is also in the name of anti fascism.

You see   as long as you put  in the name of anti fascism  after any action it makes it justified 

So repressing thoughts and ideas that don t align with yours or the general narrative   although fascistic  is actually against fascism because it s in the name of anti fascism 

See   It s ok guys  Selective photos can be used to make a case for anything...

But yes  I agree with you. The way the media is handling this is absurd. The riots at the capital were wrong and disgraceful  and both sides agree on that. What s sickening is the double standard by the left. To be fair they both suck. 

And if this dumbass  second invasion but with guns this time  goes off an AWB will follow. Guaranteed. 

Some things are worth fighting for but a hoax and a man s ego are not. I m not an American. But I just don t understand the hypocrisy and double standards you guys have. A lot of statues were desecrated by the BLM and antifa  towns were burnt yet no one called them terrorists  but peaceful protestors. It s so blatantly obvious to everyone over here but seemingly barely anyone agrees when someone mentions it online. 

Not that the latest shit is okay  it s  not . Both are violent protests riots. But I would personally put a value on those who lost their possessions  and lives  during the protests last year. The damage the two sides did is vastly different. 

I also know that the democratic leaders bailed the jailed protesters. While these guys on the 6th get  years  if I heard right..... I personally don t like to participate in this tragedy Olympic but I am surprised at the Americans who are defending the attack on the Whitehouse.   As an outsider   I always thought those grounds were sacred. So accurate pEaCeFuL pRoTeStS That protest of the Capitol building reminds me a lot of the cheese wheel in the White House that was gifted to Andrew Jackson. 

https   www.foodandwine.com news real story huge chunk cheese sat white house year

https   www.whitehousehistory.org photos painting of andrew jacksons cheese gift

Those people weren t remembered by the history books as terrorists or leading a coup  they were just people who liked cheese. Andrew Jackson let the people eat the cheese as a symbol that the White House was the peoples  house. Real quick  the worst act of terrorism in the United States since 9 11 is the Las Vegas mass shooting of which any subsequent investigation lacked substantial answers to the questions citizens had in regards to said terrorism. You forgot the poop smeared on the walls in the capitol building. Someone do something with these links.

As far as death and destruction  I m sure BLM and antifa have far exceeded what some Trump supporters have done in any group setting. 

Unfortunately  there s a decent chance of a repeat of DC. I swear this sub used to be somewhat sensible. Why the fuck is there attempts to minimise what just happened. There were bombs  there were people attempting to take the lives of representatives and senators.

Because BLM did shit loads of damage  we should give this more of a pass

So my question is simply  how could you in good faith and conscience continue to believe the election was stolen when the judicial system to include Republican judges  have ruled against it   

I know a guy who has a cousin who works in an election center where he witnessed ballots being destroyed... is not sufficient evidence to overturn an election.

He s essentially saying Trump supporters are Nazis. When they took their issues to government rather than fuck up small business and burn buildings. I mean what happened on social media more comparable to the night of the broken glass so he can t really talk The Son of a nazi... who is best known for a bad accent and pushing metal... No worry that he doesn t know history... but he sure likes to fuck the help  and Betray hos wife and children     Why wouldn t we listen to another Celebre tards take on history  Let s be honest  Arnie has been part of some great movies  but he hasn t done anything good in almost 30 years. Don t be coming in here being all   What about  End of Days    The 6th Day    or T3  Blah  blah  blah  blah.  His last good movie was  True Lies   end of discussion. 

You know when a guy s tenure is up when he does voiceover work for a PBS kiddie cartoon show  a jump the shark cameo on  Two and a Half Men   and rides the coattails of President Trump s  The Apprentice   only to have that little pet project crash and burn . 

I ll be the first to admit it  I looked up to the guy when I was a kid. Anytime  Terminator 2  Judgment Day  was on network television  I made damn sure to watch it no matter what  this was WELL before the time of cable tv proliferation and today s streaming services . Growing up  I had just about every Arnie movie on VHS  Laserdisc  DVD  and Blu ray. I even have two of his flicks  posters framed in my theatre room  T1  amp  T2 . 

The guy s well accomplished  Mr. Olympia  former tanker  actor  politician  businessman  etc.  no one s taking that away from him. Even when news of his extramarital affair other son came out  the guy was able to sorta right the ship. He lost a lot of points with a lot of people on that one  but he still continued to stay relevant and got parts in what were otherwise meh productions. But this  this is downright insane.

For him to make parallels to the Capitol Incident and Kristallnacht is at the very least reckless and irresponsible. The guy s virtue signaling and wants to be on  the right side of history.  It s time for Arnold to just retire or start producing things like Sly or Mel. He needs to stop pandering to people who likely despised him in the past for being a  conservative  or a womanizer. The guy is trying to win points with those who ll likely cancel him once they focus on his past. Arnold  regardless of your pandering and Orange Man Bad rhetoric  your time will come and you will succumb to the same fate as some of these other Hollywood scumbags. 

Contrary to what you said in your 1991 masterpiece   I cannot self terminate.  You just did. It was disgusting.  But nothing new. Most of these celebrities say dumb shit It was extremely offensive to have a pogrom directed at Jews compared to a riot over election concerns. One was a state approved attack that saw no help from local authorities to stop the brownshirts  whereas the Capitol riot has been universally condemned by both sides. It means Arnold is a syncophantic moron.

We CAN make some Nazi comparisons though. The capital riot was much much more like the Reichstg Fire. It provided Hitler an excuse to claim dictatorial powers.

We see Dems using this event the same way. Silencing opposition being the most clear behavior  but also calls for the expulsion of opposition politicians etc. It s chilling and more Nazi like than anything the Dems have ever claimed about Trump X infinity. This was more like the Beer Hall Putsch that took place about 15 years prior Arnie wants back in politics. He s building a politically correct social media and public statement history. Wether he runs as a RINO or switches to Democrat not sure yet. Keep in mind Newsome could be recalled. That was incredibly unthoughtful of him. There is no comparison  maybe he should talk about how the BLM and antifa riots are like that because it would be slightly more correct. It was a bad analogy for many reason. My thoughts are Arnie s losing it.  There s no factual correlation between the two events.

Plus  don t quote me on this  but Arnie s still pouting cuz he couldn t run for Prez.  He would diss any Prez.","I personally feel it was in very bad taste to compare the Capitol riot to a night when 30 000 Jews were sent to concentration camps  nearly 300 synagogs were destroyed and over 7 000 businesses owned by Jewish people were ransacked. 
Both were horrible events  but I do not believe they are comparable. I understand his sentiment and the metaphor he was trying to make   but this comparison was not appropriate. What are your thoughts "

 https   i.postimg.cc WpQxq1q3 Deroy Murdock Vote fraud Fraud by category and state.jpg  https   i.postimg.cc WpQxq1q3 Deroy Murdock Vote fraud Fraud by category and state.jpg  Many of the courts said this was a state issue. I think for anything short of the presidency people would be more willing to accept that. But when the presidency is at stake  and some of the irregularities look to span state lines  no one should have to wait around for their  state s governments to decide if they ll investigate it or not. 

The idea that state officials might be punished for election fraud isn t a big enough consequence to make up for an illegitimate president. 

This is the position of most of us on the right. Extremist idiots have eclipsed the rest of us by giving the media something to focus on while they hunt us down. As far as the numbers of votes goes  obviously a law suit submitted by President Trump s legal team is going to make the claim that there were enough fraudulent votes to swing the state the other way. You wouldn t bother making the case if your claim is that there was fraud but not enough to actually make a difference.

The fact that Deroy considers making this spreadsheet while using that same legal teams claims is a bit baffling. I wouldn t even consider that to be investigative journalism  just a middle school kid plugging numbers into an excel.

If there are indeed 53 fraudulent votes for every 1 legitimate vote in Georgia  I think we will hear about it soon. Those are legally required to be on paper attached to a name and an address and it s not hard to determine if a majority  let alone a ratio of 50 1 is legitimate or not.

Who knew  It seems like Google for sure and Apple if they follow through are ripe for snti trust law suits. Not all the Dems are in love with big tech as well. Could be one more nail in their coffin if they lose a big court case. Hell yes to this response. Can t wait for Trump to move over. Already have Eric added. Will be nice to have normal conversations again You can still type the url into any search engine and login. Instead of a one touch app  it s now a two step In order to get around this  we either need antitrust actions  which won t happen  or we need a new hardware for computers and phones that do not conduct censorship. Wait is it spelled parler or parlor  Just searched it up in the App Store and not too sure How do we download this now   Businesses should be able to refuse business to anyone  on their own terms      but not like that    shocked pikachu face  And yet they ve removed posts from Parler. So what does that say about free speech  Aren t twitter  apple and amazon private companies  Aren t they basically allowed to do this  Jeez  at least understand what  Free Speech  even means and what it protects.

Clue  if I write to a newspaper and demand that they publish my opinion that Trump is a deluded manchild on their front page  should they be legally obligued to do it  Or can they refuse to carry my words  Well...  What is your opinion  The app doesn t moderate it s users  many of whom  not all  are promoting violence on a large scale.  This is against Apple s TOS.  Trump got taken off Twitter for the same reason.  At least Apple gave a warning.

This isn t cencorship.  If terrorists  again just some of the users are real terrorists like the guy who brought the pipe bomb  are using the app to promote violence  and the mods are overlooking and sometimes even encouraging it  then Apple can and should take it down.  They are not taking the app down because there are Trump supporters. We won t cave  Says man who doesn t have a choice. Said the fascist Parler won t cave.  They ll just have their funding and hosting removed instead  so it won t matter anyhow. Amazon as far as I know has not been with Apple FB Twitt have they  F   IN A 

GOD BLESS THIS MAN Everyone knows Apple blows. So does  Jack NPCs frown harder Amen Thank you  Parler CEO. Trump s a gay wedding cake. TOR Apple is free to remove anyone from Their app store.  Saying they hate free speech is hyperbolic nonsense. I m all for free speech but have you seen some of the threats and hate speech that is happening on that app right now  Parler is an anti Semitic breeding ground. Only Jesus haters join Parler. Parler is still shit in the end",

Stiiiiiil waiting... And not a single  journalist  will give Dorsey a hard time Twitter needs to take that down as well. Private companies can do business with who they d like but geez Kathy Griffin should have been banned for her stunt too. I m of the mind social media companies are accountable for allowing violence or hate on their platform. I do also believe it should be fair across the board and I don t think it has been. I feel like a lot of this drama could be curved if presidents  Speaker of the House  Senate Majority Leader etc  freeze their personal Twitter when they get into office. I mean Trump s only the second president to use it which shows that you don t need it for the position and frankly it s caused a lot of drama. The president still has a very real means to speak his her mind. They have a podium in their home available to them to answer questions or speak at any time. Oh Jack you have been a bad bad ragamuffin Im a conservative  but i think the people who want this are going a bit too far  Wtf.  Maybe the Gov should serve him a warrant for allowing violence to trend.  Epitome of hypocrisy  removed  Guys it s the Maga crowd who are chanting hang Mike  not the left. Here s a video

t3_ku5b55,Delta Airlines allegedly landed plane to remove passengers  who were  having private conversations about supporting Trump. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/ku5b55/delta_airlines_allegedly_landed_plane_to_remove/,"If this is true I will definitely not ever be flying Delta again. It has nothing to do with these individuals and their allegid support for Trump. Are we really at a place where a major airline would land a plane and remove passengers simply based on a private non violent conversation   God help us. How... Like for real what is the justification for this   How is this legal in any way  shape or form 

Well I looked it up  it is but it seems they need to compensate you somehow.  But that s before getting on the flight.


 gt FAA  Rights of air carriers to exclude or refuse to acceptp assengers. Section 44902 b  of the FAA  known as  permissive refusal   provides pilots with broad authority to remove passengers. The pilot in command stands in the role of the air carrier and can decide whether to remove a passenger from a flight for safety reasons.

 gt State tort claims relating to a passenger s removal from an aircraft for safety reasons are preempted by   44902 b . While the FAA does not contain an express preemption provision    44902 impliedly preempts state tort claims because it is a federal standard directly on point and constitutes pervasive federal regulatory control in that area. This was recently reaffirmed in Register v. United Airlines  Inc.  2017 WL 784288  S.D. Cal. Mar. 1  2017   where the court dismissed the plaintiff s state tort causes of action and held that   t he FAA preempts all state law impinging upon the circumstances under which an air carrier may remove a passenger from a flight for safety reasons.  Given the deferential standard in   44902 b   the majority of courts hold that the removal or refusal to transport a passenger cannot give rise to a claim for damages unless the carrier s decision was  arbitrary or capricious. 

Sounds like these people might get a solid lawsuit.  That s definitely not a reason to remove an individual.  Dissent in patriotic     Hillary Clinton

Not anymore  now its a crime I seriously doubt they were kicked off for having a conversation.
  unruly passengers kicked off delta flight  https   bringmethenews.com .amp minnesota news report delta kicks unruly passengers off flight from dc to mpls  There were a handful of videos showing Trump supporters being disruptive on the flight. There was one I saw where the pilot threatened to land the plane. In the video  the passengers were loudly chanting.  Allegedly . As someone who works for an airline I can tell you there s a 0  chance a pilot would make a stop just to let off Trump supporters. You land in an airport you have to pay a fee and believe me Delta would not allow their planes off their routes for political reasons. If you believe this story I have oceanfront property in Missouri to sell you

Edit  this reeks of this person making a scene in the terminal and being denied boarding. Show a video of inside the plane and then the airline kicking her off the plane. Some inside the terminal video with zero context  Smells fishy to me I havnt had time to verify this. It costs a ton of money to make an emergency landing. i find this hard to believe.  most pilots are ex servicemen of which i have to imagine the overwhelming majority are from the right.

Seems like much of the computer world is flexing its might to remove all things Trump. Not just selling individual stock but mutual funds as well.

The lowest its ever been was around 20  and the highest was around 55 
Even IF he wasn t banned  I am sure his follower numbers alone would have dropped after his Presidency  that s to be expected.

Welcome to the new world.  deleted  I understand Twitter enforces their own rules the way they want to enforce them  but if Trump got blocked  then there are so many high profile figures from the Muslim world that have to get blocked as well for their support of violence and intolerance. Unfortunately I m afraid that Twitter is afraid to block them  for some reason... Even though  and I know that s maybe tough for them to comprehend  Donald Trump and the GOP represent a much  much  much  lower threat than Islamic terrorists. It a true. How nice another poser.

How many truly terrible people are still supported by Twitter  I hate to say it  but not too many made a fuss when Alex Jones was banned. That was the beginning. I will say  Ben Shapiro made several statements about it  and that it was wrong.

Try it  it works. You judge based off the content of the person s character not which box they check on a ballot she is still your neighbor. if he s a good person he s a good person nothing has changed that.

Whatever happened to judging people based off of their content of character  I think Joe Biden is a disgusting and bigoted racist and have proof of it on the senate floor. Half of the people I know are democrats. But who you vote for doesn t dictate who you can be friends with. Liberals tend to worship their leaders and think they can t be friends with conservatives. It s truly disgusting and is a big part of what is ripping this country apart. Hope you open your eyes and see how petty and ridiculous this question is. Good luck","I m still in shock.

t3_kul3lt,In Defense of  Whataboutism     We can t afford to declare that ordinary ways of thinking and arguing are simply out of order.,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/kul3lt/in_defense_of_whataboutism_we_cant_afford_to/," gt Whataboutism is a valid  even necessary  tool for thinking and debating. It is one way that intelligent people think through events and arguments. Nowadays  we need every tool available for clear deliberation.

Whataboutism is the worst form of logical reasoning known to anyone engaged in an argument.

Whataboutism is how you shield your argument from facing the repercussions and consequences of an action.

Let s say Joe rapes someone but gets off on a technicality.

Then I rape someone.  You demand that I face punishment.  How does me pointing to Joe and saying  Well  what about Joe  he raped someone and he didn t face any consequences     have any bearing on the deplorable thing I ve done   Does Joe s rape suddenly make my rape okay   NO  rape is bad.  Period.  

When I engage in whataboutism  it isn t to acknowledge that I am wrong  it is to deflect  to obfuscate  to shift the focus of the debate and it is pure bullshit.

What is needed is an acknowledgement by ALL sides that XYZ is bad and NO MATTER WHO DOES IT  XYZ should be punished.

But that isn t what whataboutism seeks to do and that is why whataboutism is complete bullshit.

Whataboutism is how you enable evil.  It is how and why the GOP is in the mess it is in right now. Because instead of holding itself accountable it simply points at the Dems and says  Well  What about when the Dems did XYZ    

The GOP should hold itself to the standard by which it judges and ridicules the Dems but they do not.  The GOP instead excuses their bullshit with the comfort of  Well  at least we aren t as bad as the Dems so its okay for us to do XYZ becuase the Dems do XYZ 

That is not how you maintain the moral high ground and as such  the GOP party has descended into dishonor and shame.  History will not look kindly on the GOP right now in this moment in time.

That is the consequence of a philosophy steeped in whataboutism... It can be used like the article says or it can be used for deflection. The larger issue is that conversations might be more productive if we tried not jumping to negative assumptions about whoever we re talking to as quickly.",

EDIT  forgot a word Can you post this on Twatter or Fecalbook  
  
I bet it would be removed before the day is done 

I m going to add to Parler I was on TikTok and some dumbass had an obviously edited video of trump with his family members and Captioned it.. Trump watch party for the Storming the Capitol  . They had some of his family members saying some BS...and anyone with half a brain could see it was heavily edited   But these stupid ass morons in the comments were eating it up    It was so ridiculous    It was like they didn t want to see the truth    How much damage was caused earlier this week  

 100 000  if we re being generous  Compared to the BILLIONS caused by BLM  

I ve also heard the argument  but they killed a cop   

Is David Dorn a joke to you people  I got banned from r moderatepolitics for mentioning some of the things on this list. And the downvotes were serious. It s a joke that they think they re moderate and shows how  like most  they re deluded about the extent of what s been happening in the world. Repost in Politics and they ll probably ban you for revealing truth This is a serious question  what did Trump say that  incited violence  Wednesday   I m searching  but keep coming up with news articles quoting different people  accusing  him of such  but can t find where he actually called for ppl to be violent or act aggressively.

I like your graphic btw  but one person killed Wednesday is 1 too many. It kinda made me squirm to see that listed so laissez faire. This is gas lighting to an extreme. The msm should have 0 credibility and people are still listening to them.  removed  wait so what s the source  There was outrage from the blm riots  just mostly from the right and moderate democrats BLM was mostly outrage over something that s way overblown by the media  the capital protests we re about stopping an overreaching and corrupt government  I do not condone the damage done but the protest was for a reason  and obviously when the government does all it s doing now people are going to get angry and stand up. I knew this was going to happen sooner or later The list is great.  But downplaying the capitol by saying  one federal building  is disingenuous.  I m highly outraged on just that fact alone.  

The dems scream that conservatives are idiots and liars.  We have a duty to show them the truth. Before  i say anything i say that i condemn every violet protests  anything that goes rogue with a certain group going rogue is wrong and should be punished. PERIOD.

BUT BUT BUT 
The catch here is that it is not just any federal building or any state capitol with no one inside. Its full with all the people that the whole United States elected to represent us. Liberal and Conservative. Could you have guaranteed that no elected representative have been hurt if they were there  This is beyond comparison and anything beside rogue seeing a guy with zip tie handcuffs. 

This is wrong and we all need to set a precedent that it can t happen again  whatever party or ideology you represent and support. Comparing and trying to prove isn t going to make it less long. 

IT SHOULDN T HAVE HAPPENED AND CAN T HAPPEN AGAIN Amen This delusional false equivalency is almost adorable in its ignorance Police let individuals upset at the election near congress. Republican and Democrat senators and reps should always be protected from mobs. 

The speaker of house and vice president were one room away from being potentially assassinated. 

That s the big difference for me.      I m a leftwing Liberal who frequently visits this subreddit just out of genuine curiosity.

But I have to agree with this. The hypocrisy is outstanding. I disagree with both acts of violence and rioting. The left have been hypocrites for a long time with how their acting. It s so counter productive to what we re actually meant to be all about  removed  Trump signed an executive order that damaging federal property 20 years minimum. Have fun. But you didn t cite the reason for such riot  More than 1 death so I d wait before spreading it again Encouraged by the president of the United States of America. And if you do the math and add up the numbers from 1 day to 7 month... It s hard to compare with such different time scales. So doing the math to put them on the same scale. 7 months is 213 days. several hours is about 1 3 of a day. So we have 

 amp  x200B 

 BLM Capitol Riot 
       
 Encouraged by killing of innocent civilians. Encouraged by fringe political groups 
 Police force used Police encouraged and joined rioters 
 0.11 people shot per day 3 people shot per day 
 3 officers injured per day 42 officers injured per day 
 0.7 fed buildings damaged per day 3 fed building damaged per day 
 hundreds 213 businesses destroyed per day Attempt to disrupt democracy at best. Terrorism at worst.  Ever watch Vice News  It s the epitome of liberal hypocrisy. They are exactly what this post is pointing out. AND the one at the Capitol was most likely a false flag  Pretty sure smearing your shit on the walls of any Capitol building is a bit different. Of course more were injured  as it lasted 7 months instead of several hours so the sizes of each party is different  not to mention the obvious racial biases in play...
That being said  riots are riots. We shouldn t have any from either party. Sometimes violence gets countered with more violence. I think that BLM is nowhere near as bad as the capitol riot  or at least I don t think that the non violent protests are bad at all. Responding with more violence is bad but if violence is the only language cops understand then... what can they do 

Also  BLM had no outrage  Are you fucking insane  BLM was constantly talked about in all media outlets for months. If you can t see the difference between blm and trying to hunt down the Vice President with Zip tie handcuffs and gallows outside... I can t help you.  

    DISCLAIMER    

I believe that both riots were wrong. My opinion can change on the BLM part  because a lot of those were peaceful  but  addressing the riots 

Both were wrong. The BLM riots were in response to the killing of various unarmed black people  one of which allegedly used a fake  20 bill  if I m remembering that right   and a police officer suffocated George Floyd for that. There were a lot of peaceful protests  but the violent riots were not acceptable and not the right way at all to come to a solution with others concerning the issue at hand. Thing is  even at a lot of the peaceful protests happening in 2020  violent police force was used against people protesting  not talking about the riots there . For the Capital Riot  the rioters got in to the American Capital with relative ease. The police in this case were taking selfies with them and even letting a few pass by. This same police department  along with armed soldiers  cleared out peaceful George Floyd protesters using  tear gas  smoke devices  and excessive force  https   theintercept.com 2020 07 28 dc lafayette square protesters congress hearing  .

Saying there was no outrage to the BLM riots is false  as show  here  https   www.usatoday.com story news factcheck 2020 08 13 fact check democrats have condemned violence linked protests 3317862001  . Obviously  the BLM riots did more damage over 6 to 7 months than one riot did in a day. The difference is that these people attacked and stormed the United States Congress  and attacked our country and our electoral process. They took down the American flag and flew a Trump one. Another person flew the Confederate flag inside the halls of Congress. I am not trying to downplay the BLM riots  but the President said the rioters were   lovely people  and that  he loves them   https   www.cnn.com 2021 01 07 politics trump history comments trnd index.html  before making his apology. While no small businesses were destroyed  I don t need to say the severity of the Capital attacks.

I don t know why I wrote this  but I needed to let out my thoughts. Have a good day fellow internet bros. This is fantastic Donald Trump is a  fringe political group   Also  only one federal building houses all of congress  so I don t get that equivalence. 

How many cops did BLM kill  

Doesn t attacking Congress jeopardize literally every business  

...I have so many questions. blm  trashed some  police stations  targets and burger kings over those 7 months  alongside many peaceful protests  93   

capitol riot  stormed and broke into one of the if not the most important building of the us government  case could be made for an actual coup attempt.

yeah no difference here. watch as covid magically disappears after biden takes office. I think most of the outrage or the main difference that people   Democrats   whoever you want to say that  point out is the reason behind it.

To play devil s advocate on this subreddit  BLM was  was meant to be  started as protests against police brutality  and racial profiling  .
The invasion the other day was an invasion on the Capitol when the new president was going to be appointed by people that GENUINELY think that the election was totally fraudulent and that Trump is the legitimate president. The impressive thing is that  up to millions of Americans might be leas to believe a lie due to ego  selfishness and the greed of those that want to fulfill their agenda.

Feel free to comment and debate on this. I just came to give perspective. Sure BLM did more harm from the participants  whoever they might have been.  removed  You guys probably don t care  but as a supporter of BLM  many if not all  of the supporters of racial equality very much condemned the riots. The protests in many cases were meant to be solely peaceful.

Many  not all  but more than a few  turned into riots either because of unnecessary force from the police while the protests from the police or minor violent altercations between counter protestors and protestors that escalated to a point that the true purpose and goal was lost in the chaos that ensued. 

I personally condemn all of the riots that took place  but it s completely unfair to claim that these events are the same. This was a cult like group of people protesting the certification of the electoral college  a foundation of democracy based on claims from a man who convinced his supporters that the election was rigged before it began. 

Black people just want to be viewed as equal in the eyes of the law.

Black Lives Matter.  deleted  Liberal fucks do not care about facts  truth  respect  religion  or family.. Preach  Well one was about civil issues and police brutality and never brought bombs. The other was trying to take over the government of our democratic nation because they didn t get their way in an election. Oh and there have been bombs brought by these people. So..... The double standard is strong. So some riots are okay  Destruction of property  breaking and entering  thats okay sometimes  But one was to try and make change so that black people stop getting murdered and the other was an attempted coup d etat by followers of a wannabe dictator who have no proof for their conspiracy theories ",

When you consider what a monopoly the giants in that field have  you have to believe there is some anxious talent out there that just need a bit of startup and support. I hope he does God no. Why bother at this point   The Leftists will just deny funding and access to it. I understand the desire to seek out a platform at which voices can be protected  ideologically. But doesn t that make things worse  Without bipartisanship  it s virtually impossible to enact a political agenda because of the way the government is set up  and bipartisanship only happens when ideological bases discuss and crossover with one another. I think that rather than seeking a new platform  finding ways to encourage civil discussion on existing platforms would be more productive for all agendas. Parler is just fine With blackjack and hookers 

The right time to do that was a year ago or when a bunch of libertarians and conservatives  and even some on the left like Emily ratajkowski  were talking about censorship of activists and voices on  social media.  emrata about the far left though

May God have mercy on us all  for they know not what they have wrought. Never forget these people want you removed. The party of anti fascism is banning and silencing opposing political ideas. Cuz that s democracy not fascism. Welcome to 1984. I just had this weird analogy pop in to my head.  The conservatives are like Dumbledore  the left is Voldemort.  For those of you who are HP fans  Dumbledore would not kill his enemies  he believed they could be rehabilitated and redeemed.  Voldemort killed anyone who would not bow before him. Amen. Inshalla. These people want you broke  dead  your kids raped and brainwashed  and they think it s funny. Notice how all this is happening before Biden takes office so he can claim he has no authority over it.  Between now and the inauguration a lot of crap is going down  all of which he can remain separated from. Fuck happened much faster than anyone anticipated They feel great because they are fucking delusional. time to blend in I hate to say this  but everything we are seeing now is child s play.  If there is any sort of trouble on Inauguration Day  then the crap will really hit the fan.  Trumps failure to realize he lost has wrought this. Those are all platforms built by  leftists . Make your own. They took the time to learn their craft... if you desire what they have do that for yourself. When you run the show you can do however you like  and that is what they are doing. Simple. You ll always be allowed to speak as long as you aren t planning terrorism.

Look at what BLM has been doing for almost a year.

They are smart enough to keep the violent people out of power in their movement so the movement doesn t get blamed for violence and they can get away with all kinds of protests.

Your problem is you keep electing psychopaths as your leadership then you are surprised when they ruin things for you. Choose better people to lead you.

And to be clear  I do mean the textbook definition of psychopathy. 

Not one single Republican congressman or senator sees other human beings in anything but the most Randian of terms. They ask themselves   Can this person benefit me more than anyone else   and if not they don t care about that person. 

Psychopaths assign everyone a value based on how useful they are. 

To the wealthy  unless you are already wealthy  you have no value. 

Stop choosing leaders who see you as objects to be used instead of people to be protected and everyone will be better off.  removed ","Today twitter totally suspended Trump.

https   www.foxnews.com media abc news movement trump supporters following capitol riots

 gt An ABC News article calling for the  cleansing  of the movement of President Trump s supporters was stealth edited after critics questioned the charged word.

 gt  Even aside from impeachment and 25th Amendment talk  Trump will be an ex president in 13 days   ABC s Rick Klein and MaryAlice Parks wrote for The Note on Thursday.  The fact is that getting rid of Trump is the easy part. Cleansing the movement he commands  or getting rid of what he represents to so many Americans  is going to be something else. 


Because they definitely celebrate if Trump supporters lose jobs  book deals   health battles...

 Good riddance   or  They deserve it  

For four years the left has told us that Trump is a dictator who is going to be rounding up Americans  any day now. 

I think that too many leftists would stand silent if the government came to  cleanse  their neighborhoods of  radical Trump supporters .

Before they do THAT  though... they will do this 

https   www.congress.gov bill 117th congress house bill 127 s 1 amp r 90

A nice  welcome and TOTALLY NEEDED REGISTRY of people who have guns   Because that is the government s business 

Because there may be radical  needing to be cleansed  Trump supporters among you... who OBVIOUSLY need to have their firearms removed because they are clearly dangerous.

Yes  we know that the Marxists said that an unarmed Communist is a dead communist...but now the Democrats have control   Things are great   Need to get the guns out of the hands of anyone who might object to  building back better    It s for the greater good 

The Republicans have been pissed at the Republicans because when THEY get total control  they don t do any of the things they promised to do in order to get elected.

Now that the Democrats are in control they are moving in RECORD time...honestly  head spinningly quick time to silence people  institute gun control and Lord only knows what the next thing is.

And I mean...Lord only knows  because a lot of us are seeing things right now in Biblical terms.

So long as it remains legal to do that.  I expect that will end soon  too.

Can I get an a woman 

So...yeah... we aren t feeling good about things.

We expect that we won t be allowed to speak for much longer.

Even after he leaves office he s going to be one of the most politically influential people in the country. The core issues that got Trump elected to president have not gone away. Republican voters want a party that puts America first  fights for the average person  and puts up a fight against the leftist anti American  anti christian  and anti white rhetoric. They don t want a bunch of country club elites who seem to only care about corporate tax rates and international conflicts.

Trump has plenty of faults that ultimately cost him dearly  but I fear that the Republicans are so myopic that most of them will only see those faults and refuse to learn anything from what he did right. Sadly  the GOP will spend the next four years tearing itself apart. Establishment Republicans will lean into the Democrat narrative holding yesterday s incident as the sum total of Trump s legacy  while Trump loyalists will try to consolidate support with supporters that Trump brought into the GOP tent. 

The result will be the GOP bickering until they realize the Democrats burned down the town. Actually   Trump supporters   Republicans and conservatives in general will have no voice in the newly elected government   and they will not only be disrespected   they will be treated with utter contempt as well.

For GOP Senators they will are being trapped as many will run for reelection in purple states. If they vote yes they will lose there base. 

For Trump  it s not enough to cheat him out of the election they now want his name destroyed and his ability to run again gone forever. They will do all they can to destroy him. He will be blamed by leftists for anything that goes wrong for the next 12 years easily. I have the same thoughts as well. Why Impeach Trump when he s leaving in less than 2 weeks 

My guess is that Pelosi and other Democrats wants credit for this type of stuff to feed their ego. In other words  to pat themselves on the back and brag about it years later.

Also  it gives them a higher chance to be re elected into office by voters especially the Senior HS and College University kids  who solely vote for them based on this incident and nothing else.

    2  This is misinformation
    1  r DonaldTrump just got banned for less  shitgrin. Take it down or we take you down.

 When you tear out a man s tongue  you are not proving him a liar  you re only telling the world that you fear what he might say.  

I d rather have the subreddit taken down than cave to a mob determined to try to impose Orwellian censorship and thought control.  Go try and intimidate someone else. Gotta love the narrative. BLM Antifa push the  correct  think  conservatives push wrongthink. Thats why its different.
Remember folks  the government is not afraid of you  they are not your friend. Let s be clear both of these situations were riots and shouldn t have happened. But the gross double standard needs to stop. They both are. Once a protest becomes violent and damaging it ceases to be a protest and is declared a riot. 

Trump supporters do NOT support these criminals and want them to be punished to the fullest extent.

We only ask the people on the left demand the same of blm and Antifa rioters Because leftist are always peaceful and can t do any wrong remember  It s all part of the lefts long term strategy and is working.  They have taken over the schools  the press  and now the government.  I just hope we don t spiral to third world status to fast. Bottom line is CNN is stupid Come on man. You know the deal. It s fine when the left does it and the end of democracy when the right does it. I condemn both. As soon as this shit started up the other day I knew they were going to pound this narrative into the ground. DC burned during the summer. They burned down St. John s church. The mayor let all this shit go on at the time. It s disgraceful. The media is disgusting in this country. At this point  with the media against half  I d argue all  of Americans and our electoral system suffering legitimacy issues  our best recourse is voting with our dollars. Buy American made  avoid made in China  stop giving ratings to MSM  contribute and vote for politicians you believe in... and most importantly  stand firm in your American values even as they try to dehumanize us. imagine a scene where BLM pushed their way into the capitol building and an unarmed woman gets shot and killed... The riots wouldn t end for weeks  they would burn dc down and the media would defend them  the cops would abandon their posts and let them reign. The double standard is disgusting... Angry white peoples  riot

Angry black people burning and looting   peaceful protest. 

Fun Fact  Covid doesn t at Peaceful Protest but riots are Super spreader events. Newspeak. Because muh feelings On another subreddit  on a meme about the capitol rioters being domestic terrorists. I said I agree they are but they have to agree BLM and ANTIFA are terrorist organizations. I got downvoted by multiple people... the hypocrisy and ignorance is truly baffling  I even provided them with a literal definition of terrorism and they still deny it. Wtf happened to this sub for like 24 hours  One is CNN and the other is Fox. Credit to Fox for calling it what it is  this was a riot  plain and simple. Of course  can t expect the same from CNN. 
I feel bad for all the protesters who remained peaceful. A few idiots had to ruin it for all of them  and deal conservatives everywhere a huge blow. Just truly sad. Control the language. Control the narrative. Control the story. Control your mind. We re the people at the capitol building armed  I m having a hard time finding a legitimate answer as some outlets say yes  and others don t specify  and I have heard others say no. It s like pulling teeth try to get any facts about the situation only without a long drawn out article the revolves mostly around the writers personal opinion on the event. I think all rioting is stupid. It might be time to start building support for state legislation however. Thank you. I don t like destruction of any property  but the hypocrisy of this situation is nauseating. There both riots. They both should have never happened. But you better your ass those companies will show there viewers what they want to hear or push what they want there viewers to believe So while everyone is playing the What If game. What if BLM or Antifa did storm the capital and one was shot inside. You know it would be controversial  but they would have people who defend them claiming what they did was  democracy  or something. If the left would have done this  it would have been controversial but not universally. Because the right did it  and they hold basically no power...it is universal. This is a real issue. That whole mess was set up. I was watching live streams and NONE of the Trump supporters were causing violence. Only the fuckers wearing tactical gear. Where have we seen that before  Couldn t be ANTIFA right  Depends on who controls the media...  Doublethink  https   imgur.com nx5tyNm . The surveillance  the mostly compliant populace  the constant alterations and redefinition of language to better fit the approved narrative  it s all here now. The irony of course is that Fox News called it a riot Liberal hypocrisy hard at work leading their mindless sheep. All the libtards and their enablers are saying  if the Capitol rioters had been black...   eye roll  So much for reconciliation. Fingers crossed that Manchin and Sinema act as last lines of defense against the craziest bills that are going to spring up. CNN and Fox are practically on the same page now. They both are Because double standards There is a double speak of course. 
Also two wrongs don t make it right. Fuck fox Kayleigh looked so tired and worn out in this video.    Firey but mostly peaceful protest.....hmmm  What happened at the Capitol couldn t have been a protest  no televisions were stolen  no stores burned down  no Wal Marts looted  Target wasn t targeted  and not one Church lit on fire.... Yeah sure  peaceful protester At least they re not calling it a coup. In the first panel the POLICE agitated protestors to create chaos on purpose.  Jan 6 police did nothing while citizens destroyed and tried to murder humans beings. Damn kayleigh is so hot. i couldn t take my eyes off her the whole briefing. If the left blm antifa had some hotter chicks I might support them  but right now the right has more cutie blondes. Cops kill innocent Black people  Black people protest  cops kill them more.

t3_ktadv0,I was in Washington DC on the 6th from Kansas City. Here s what I saw.,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/ktadv0/i_was_in_washington_dc_on_the_6th_from_kansas/,"I was there and Antifa was quite obvious even in their MAGA hats.   Easy to spot actually.  And there were LOTS of them.  Saw regular people trying to stop them from pepper spraying the cops and smashing windows.   So their MAGA costumes fooled no one but the FBI it seems   PS the media Lies    OF COURSE THE MEDIA LIES 

Do you think they would pass such opportunity  Fuckin media... This is basically how I thought it went. Thanks for sharing. I disagree with you politically  but I am sure the media is exaggerating in some respects  as the media is wont to do.

I m curious though  what exactly do Trump and his followers believe Pence has the power to do here  to prevent certification  Legally his role is ceremonial. I m genuinely confused at the pressure exerted on the VP to do something he does not have constitutional authority to do. Am I missing something  I never figured that everyone in the crowd was for the violence and trespassing that occurred  but I think the main point is that many  were  and that was directly exploited by the President and his entourage. It may not do the same thing to you but when he says the election was stolen and other unfounded  divisive claims but it fires up his radical supporters and he knows that. And used it on the 6th. He is a detriment to the country. I m sorry you had to be bunched in with it because of one feeble minded man. Stopped reading after the first sentence.  We all saw it unfold live.  Probably with a better vantage than you  since we had many angles and camera locations. Case closed FBI. This redditor was able to witness every single incident that happened Wednesday. Just use this guy as your primary witness ","The media is exaggerating and lying about what happened...per usual.

President Trump DID NOT call for violence or aggression. It was an inspiring and patriotic protest march that was meant to send a message to VP Pence and Congress  not for violence.

From my experience everyone we encountered were nice  no negative chanting  and peaceful. I felt safe and was there for the majority of it  until 2 30ish . 

At the Capitol we were in the middle section and far enough back we could see but not so close we saw people break through barriers.  It wasn t until my sister called me and pointed it out I started seeing it and then we saw tear gas and decided it was time to leave. Many were not aware and so tightly packed in they probably couldn t move away. 

There are always the few that have to be stupid and don t represent the rest us. What I have heard is completely not what I witnessed or experienced. However It was massive so maybe I just didn t see those things.

There were all races there and nothing racist chanted that I saw  Lots of kindness and considerate people looking out for and helping others  elderly  disabled  veterans  move through the crowds.

Just like in other protest we witnessed earlier in the year  there are always the few that misrepresent and it s really not fair to group everyone in that.

The media is lying and exaggerating a lot of what happened. They are lumping in everyone with the few. I m from Kansas City and this was my first time seeing firsthand the  bullshit  the media does.

Personal Note  God Bless Trump  America  and you all. Just because we didn t win  doesn t mean we stop for our country. Be peaceful  but take action and get involved with local politics. We can t rely on one extraordinary man to change our country and the world. We all have to do our part. Take action  do something  be brave."

He didn t even want to take a single day to cut a few billion out  force a full revote in the US Senate  and make Pelosi respond or counter his counter offer with her own new vote.  This is the only reason there are two legislative bodies and Mitch utterly failed.  I don t see why this isn t being talked about among Republicans more so than the direct relief checks or the Georgia runoffs. Ide love to see a fiscally conservative republican party that leaves social issues to the state. Anything that would move the needle or disrupt the establishment is going to be impossible to achieve through elected officials. They are all compromised. I remember asking my Government teacher in High School about Congress voting for their own salary increases. She laughed and said that if they did take advantage of that  they would just be voted out of office. I wonder what she says now. I don t blame Mitch that much for GA losses. It was going to happen the minute I saw Abrams down in GA getting ballots out. Repubs were focused on judges refusing to look at voting fraud while the Dems went right after the win. That combined with Trump voters feeling disillusioned and like there was no point in voting created a disaster. This will be huge problem going forward if not addressed.

I was wishing earlier I never started paying attention  it s unbelievable how corrupt our government is from top to bottom  I m going to try very hard to put this all behind me and forget I ever saw anything in the first place and ignore politcs for the remainder of my life. Hopefully they don t put us into concentration camps. Rush Limbaugh is a liar. He did not  predict  January 6th. He helped create it. It s men like Limbaugh who have intentionally shaped an environment of anger  paranoia and hate    and done so for their own profit. Rush is the problem. If he honestly wants to analyze the day he needs to start with his own propaganda and lies.

Rush asserts that the Washington  establishment  was the real culprit. Apparently Trump rubbed some big guns the wrong way and they responded in the usual manner. But the  establishment  did not lie about the election. That was Trump. The  establishment  did not incite the mob to storm the Capitol Building. The  establishment  did not scale barriers. They did not break into a sacred seat of government. They did not trash the place. That was Trump and his groupies breaking the law. That was Trump and his groupies throwing a tantrum. That was Trump putting himself before country. That was Trump being the traitor we ve known he was.

Rush wants to deflect the blame from where it squarely belongs  where the video of the day proves it squarely belongs. Instead he puts that blame on some nebulous  left  that only he knows.

This is yet one more nutty conspiracy theory designed to manipulate his followers. Limbaugh s goal is to extend the paranoid fantasy as far as possible.

Then he has the audacity to talk about morality. This is laughable. Limbaugh has no moral compass. Trump has no moral compass. With the right s unflinching support of immoralist Trump  they have proven beyond doubt that morality means nothing to them. Their morality is power. They are followers of Nietzsche  not Jesus. It s Nietzsche nailed to their cross.

Rush uses an Adams quote to insinuate we need religion. But that quote doesn t begin to express Adam s true opinions about religion. Adams was not talking about the religion of the Christian Right. To them  God is mere mascot used to whip up crowds for party ideology. To Adams religion and morality were virtually identical and both were grounded in reason  not some the shallow Word of Faith or emotional  faddish  enthusiasm . I doubt Adams would recognize many sects popular with the religious right as true religion.

Rush talks of  traditions and institutions that we all used to hold dear and have in common.  One of these traditions is to honor the election process. Trump and his groupies have done everything to subvert our election tradition. But that s just one in a long list of traditions and institutions Trump has attacked. Remember the free press are the enemy of the people  Remember his attacks on the CIA  FBI  CDC  and the military  Truth is  Trump and his groupies are not interested in institutions and traditions. They want to destroy them as products of a  deep state.  That s why they proudly trashed the Capitol building. 

No American should be proud of that.

Rush whines   They want somebody buried. They want a coffin  folks. They want a political coffin. 

Poor Rush  playing the victim again. The fact is that Rush is the one who wants the political coffin. He s been on that mission for decades. He s never played nice. He s never been reasonable. He plays dirty. He s always gone for blood. He s a hypocrite. He s a liar again. And I predict his audience will be willingly duped again.

Just remember one thing    a real takeaway on the Trump persona and Limbaugh s hypocrisy. Trump abandoned his groupies like Graham abandoned Trump. Trump told his groupies he d be there with them. He wasn t. Then when the  establishment  put on pressure  Trump crawled out of the White House and became the  establishment.  He changed his tune about the people he previously said he loved. They went from  very special   great patriots  to people who  defiled the seat of democracy  and  will pay.  In the end  Trump showed himself to be the worst sort of the  establishment . Let Limbaugh whine about that.",

t3_ksd0ql,Spare Me. Biden And Democrats Never Cared About Law And Order    What happened Wednesday at the U.S. Capitol was horrifying    but so was Kenosha  Minneapolis  Chaz  and Portland. Joe Biden only denounces violence when it serves him politically.,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/ksd0ql/spare_me_biden_and_democrats_never_cared_about/,"Biden called on Trump to denounce them. I m half hoping Trump says they re just an idea. I bet they go straight to terrorists and skip over the mostly peaceful protestors the people of CHAZ got labeled as. They actually fund raised to get the criminals in those cases out of jail and back on the street as soon as possible. 

Not only did they not call them out  they fund raised to enable it publicly on social media. I mean there s a lot of thoughts that go through your head like   Maybe they were just looking for Maxine Waters to get in her face  absolutely harass her and show her that she isn t wanted. 

Or... I doubt anyone is going to set up a bail fund that politicians and public figures donate to to bail out people arrested for yesterday s disturbance... 

But ultimately  my position is that I cannot be a hypocrite.

Many on the left thought it was FUNNY that the Secret Service felt that Trump was in danger during the protest  siege on the White House that injured 60 Secret Service agents.  You still see comments calling him  bunker bitch .

But what happened yesterday was wrong.  Cops were assaulted.  Windows and doors  broken.  Someone was killed.  And yeah  I m aware that it could have been worse... but it was bad.

What I DO SEE is many Republican leaders stepping up to say as much.  Which is something that we ve needed from the left from this past year because inasmuch as Republicans were on tv saying   It s horrible to see the Capitol that we love so much in this situation...   I also so long time business owners CRYING this past year because the businesses they built were totally destroyed.

So EVERYONE gets to have a reckoning now.

Either this is wrong ... or this is NOT WRONG.

Many people need to decide.  removed   gt Wednesday at the U.S. Capitol was horrifying 

No it was not. What happened last summer was horrifying. What happened yesterday was tame.

When the democrats went to war with police  armed with flashbangs and weapons and shields and they burned and looted every major American city   lol.

Mark Steyn in particular made some great comments.

And when this started yesterday  as we ourselves were trying to digest it as it occurred  we were flooded by hordes of angry leftists here so we went private  because we have better security than the Capitol apparently...

What I DID most of yesterday was pray.  Because that s what I do when the fecal matter appears to be hitting the fan.  I was mostly imploring God to get in the middle of the mob and make them know that violence was not the answer.

News is describing it as an  attempted coup ...but I don t think it was that.  I think it was a bunch of people angry that they did not feel that their government was listening to them and the massive crowd in DC is only a SMALL fraction of the people in America who think that the election was funky.

I mean... the Georgia election.  I was watching the news and I thought   This reminds me of the prior election night .  When Fox announced before 9pm that one of the Georgia counting centers was going to close so workers could go home and get some sleep I laughed out loud.  It was absolute deja vu.  I m like   They are running the same play.  

But I think the big take away  which I was feeling and discussing yesterday as it was happening was that for months in America  the media...some politicians... have acted as though violence is okay if you feel like your cause is justified.  That we have seen MONTHS of violence that folks have failed to really condemn and seem instead to excuse away as  the voice of the unheard. 

And when that happens  OTHERS get the message that violence is how you get your way.  It s how you force politicians to consider your wants.  Hell  they will set up a bail fund for you 

So America needs a reckoning... but is unlikely to have it.

The reckoning needs to be that either RIOTS and VIOLENCE are okay if you think your cause is just ... or they are not okay. Take away the illusion of choice  and they buck the system. 

Wow.

Who would have thought that people prefer freedom to caged slavery. And the solution isn t to try and fool the people into thinking their votes matter.  But that is exactly the lesson the establishment RINOs get out of something like this. Well  Democrats  both local and nationally   many police and various prosecutors  and pretty much ALL of the MSM have indicated it s ok. So..... Based on historical precident  I d say it s ok.

 Chinese don t have freedom of speech  freedom of worship or freedom from fear  but they have the freedom to move around and lead a normal day to day life. 

Now we have a picture of what  normal day to day life  should be like according to a journalist I think it s outrageous that people believe China actually got Covid under control back in March 2020. China has a massive population and is the largest commerce hub in Asia. There is absolutely no way their one time draconian lockdown stopped Covid in its tracks and they haven t been hit by additional waves like every other country in the world. They simply stopped reporting and recording cases and pretend like life has gotten back to normal  and they are being praised for their deceit. Tell that freedom to Hong Kong or Muslims or anyone who has the courage to think on their own in China.

This is a joke. Doubtful as to if China will surpass the US. Within the next decade they ll be another SARS outbreak  a common theme the world has been noticing  erupting in China.

Report Claims Dominion Error Rate Of 68    Intentionally Designed To Create Systemic Fraud 

 https   archive.is qn6LE  https   archive.is qn6LE 

 We    conclude that the Dominion Voting System is intentionally and    purposefully designed with inherent errors to create systemic fraud and    influence election results. The system intentionally generates an    enormously high number of ballot errors. The electronic ballots are then    transferred for adjudication. The intentional errors lead to bulk    adjudication of ballots with no oversight  no transparency  and no audit    trail. This leads to voter or election fraud.

t3_ks1jdz,As the last line of defense of the Republic seems to be crumbling With full federal government control    a second time after Obama s horrid 2008 2010 period    the Republic will be permanently lost if Trump s reelection is permitted to be stolen.,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/ks1jdz/as_the_last_line_of_defense_of_the_republic_seems/,"This all played out exactly as expected  the GOP legislatures didn t do anything to fight the fraud in their States that their courts and executive enabled with un Constitutional changes to election laws   the Congress was never going to stop the certification.   Barring a declaration of martial law and hundreds of arrests  the outcome was certain.  Even the protest becoming  violent  was expected because the Antifa BLM crowd was sure to make sure that happened.

So 75m  people now feel they have no where to go.  Courts refused to look at evidence  SCOTUS refused to weigh on a legitimate challenge between sovereign States which is solely their domain  so those folks are now asking what options are left to the citizens    Well there might be one  taking a cue from Brexit   and no I m not saying secede  though I believe that would be Constitutional   no   there s a potential other avenue   Article 5.

There ve been attempts over the years to call for an Article 5 Convention of States but Congress thinks they have the last say in making the call and have steadfastly refused to do so.   If you look at the purported electoral map it shows Trump won 25 States  but if we believe the election was fraudulent in 7 of those then he s at 32 States and there s many folks that believe other States that normally vote blue actually went for Trump but similar shenanigans took place.  States like Minnesota  New Mexico  possibly Virginia and even Oregon were mentioned as possible Trump flips.

So every State should put forth a referendum to demand an Article 5 convention be called.  I wouldn t be surprised if even California voted for it as State wide referendums in California often show conservative leanings.  Lets say 33 States demand the conventions  that is 66  a 2 3rds majority.  

 gt The Congress  whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary  shall propose amendments to this Constitution  or    on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states    shall call a convention for proposing amendments  which  in either case  shall be valid to all intents and purposes  as part of this Constitution  when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states  or by conventions in three fourths thereof  as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress  provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article  and that no state  without its consent  shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate.


So if 33 States call for it Congress can t stop it and if they try the States simply ignore them and declare that Congress has no standing and hold it anyway.  Put out amendments and when Congress goes to the courts  point to the text of the Article 5 and show Congress has no option to stop it  Congress can suck it.

Then the States would put forward changes to the Constitution to be sent out for ratification.  For me personally  first and foremost should be a change to terms of service. I would do something like

  President   One 6 year term  no re election
  Judiciary    One 10 year term at each level district  appellate  Supreme  for a max of 30 years  if they don t get  promoted  to the next level they re done.
  House        Max 6 2 year terms
  Senate       Max 2 6 year terms
  Congress    No more than 12 years in Congress period  in any combination of the House  amp  Senate

I think if the Presidency didn t worry about re election  but had enough time to get some things done it would be better.  Congress and Judiciary should never be life time jobs.

There are many other valid changes  taxing laws  limitations on abuse of the Commerce Clause  legal definition of Citizenship  Congress being required to live under all the same laws they apply to the country  affix the size of SCOTUS  spell out SCOTUS s total authority  etc. 

So I think the founders in their infinite wisdom gave us the tool we need to get this back under control.  Now  it would require hyper vigilance to ensure these referendums were not rigged  so we would need to start with grass roots lawsuits to demand changes in the voting machinery and processes in each State  and enough eyes to make sure everything is watched.  We need to take this step either way before the upcoming elections  we also need to ensure we do not keep any State legislators in office who support crap like universal mail in balloting  they have to go.  And if Congress tries to pass legislation dictating universal mail in balloting  we need to rally behind lawsuits against any such legislation declaring that Congress has no Constitutional authority to dictate any electoral processes  only timing.  However  during an Article V convention some basic election safe guards could be added as potential amendments as well.

Brexit took almost 5 years with the  leaders  trying every year to overturn the vote of the people  but as we saw on Dec 31  they finally succeeded.  That should give hope to the 75m  who feel cheated that it is possible  and the Constitution gives us the tool needed to make it happen.",

In the 2020 election    numerous states changed voter procedures without the approval of their respective state legislatures and in several instances extended the time for people to vote and return their mail in ballots well past election day  .

There was also fraud  the   removal of voter safeguards and signature verification standards  new rules for mail in voting  technical issues with voting machines and other significant election integrity issues   that likely influenced the official outcome of the Presidential Election.

In sworn affidavits and under penalty of perjury             more than 900 witnesses have testified that people were seen filling out blank ballots  counting votes after they asked Republican poll watchers to leave  changing votes  processing and backdating bad ballots  delivering suspicious piles of ballots to counting rooms  and blocking  ignoring or intimidating Republican poll watchers.   

Significant fraud accusations in the 2020 Presidential Election include 

       Affidavits tied to more than 600 000 ballots in Pennsylvania that claim there was no inspection of those ballots at the time they were recorded as votes.

       A former judge testified that more than 200 000 votes in Wisconsin were not valid.

       More than 1.9 million voters in Arizona are reported to have cast ballots without their signatures being verified.

Once again Republican observers are barred from doing their job despite a court order. It still happens  again   I find it hard to believe how poorly Republicans manage strategy proactively. Where s the Party attny with State Marshals to enforce the Court Order  Or some paid thugs  At least they would be professional. Well. I want everyone to realize what a dual Georgia victory means. 

First. Warnock would win a term that was set to expire in 2022  I doubt he will have any momentum by then and fizzle out like Doug Jones. 

Second. This would put the senate at a 50 50 tie  which while yes the VP breaks ties. The VP doesn t get a say in the majority leader  usually there s an agreement but it s not required. 

Third. An equally divided chamber means all one has to do to avoid a VP intervention is flip a single senator. You d be hard struck to find a GOP Senator that would flip  most got voted out . 

But we re all forgetting a very specific man  a man who doesn t give a damn about the mob and radical progressives. 

Senator Joe Manchin. He s the kingmaker now  and he damn well knows it. He can avoid punishment for straying from party lines because he is from a red state  a state where most democrats have already flipped parties and were re elected anyway. 

Joe Manchin has the ability to veto just about anything  anyone in the DNC wants. Whether for his constituents or for his own views. What things you might wonder  Well... filibusters are a notable item. 

Given the brilliance of our electorate  a VP Harris and a 50 50 Senate will lead people to believe that the Senate is under democratic control. However  that s not the case  given the incoming gridlock  people will write off the Senates failure to do anything as the majority failing. 

The GOP still has cards to play  the DNC has gone all in. 

I guess AOC and her friends mocking and attacking Manchin  attempting to cancel him  is going to come back to bite them in the ass. 

By putting the senate in gridlock  DNC is arguably just going to harm its own electoral prospects in the future. 

Ain t that a bitch. 100 000  Democrats

    1  This is misinformation



It s really not  though. He shooting of GOP rep Steve Scalise was memory holed by the MSM by the Monday after it happened. Want to guess how long we ll be hearing about this  If anyone jabs you over this ask them who James Hodgkinson is. If they don t know tell em to shut up. Welcome to the professional double standards victims If you don t actually want complete division in this country  you have to be able to call out problems on your own side. You especially have to be able to call out your own side for doing the same things you condemn the other side for doing. Again  that is if you don t actually want division and the collapse into a me vs. you nation.

But that s where we are  isn t it  That s what a lot of folks have actually been wanting  right  Republicans are deplorable  there are 62 million nazi party members  a president should be impeached based on nothing  but oh now that Biden is president we really need to work together.

And right after the riot Mike Pence stood up and talked about how there s work to be done in Congress and they all need to get back to it. On top of that  it was work which Pence was going against Trump s wishes to do and certifying a victory for his opponent. And then right after Pence came Chuck Schumer who blamed all Republicans for what had happened. Indited for the crime of being Republican  I guess. I was 1400 miles away and nowhere in my post history will you find any call to or celebration of violence and illegal action.

All the while we ve spent six months watching  an idea  burn down cities. When rioters held blocks of Seattle hostage Democrats cheered it on. A city counsilman said we should just give away those blocks to the rioters and let them keep it. Laws were passed that everyone had to stop working and not go outside  unless of course you re a BLM rioter in which case that s fine. The media made sure to tell us that there was absolutely nothing going on. Newspapers reported that the BLM riots actually  reduced  Corona  although if you wanted to go back to work you were going to kill your grandmother.

What I see is every Republican condemning this. I also see many others acting like this is the first act of violence that has ever happened in all of this mess. Still others tell me that whether violence is acceptable or not depends on what the message is. It feels stupid to have to ask  but shouldn t violence be wrong regardless of what the message is 

Go anywhere in this sub and there s not one person who justifies the violence that happened in DC. And of course not  because violence should always be condemned. But everywhere else on reddit I m still being told that I deserve to die because if which bubble I filled in  because of my faith  because of my profession. 

None of this gets better by pretending only some violence is okay and some is not. None of this gets solved merely by electing someone else. It gets better only when violence of any kind and for any reason is condemned and when the rule of law is applied equally. Finally I found the normal side of Reddit. This app is so damn liberal Democrats are not against riots  they are only against defiance of their plan to destroy the livelihoods of honest  hard working people in this country. People who believe they can stand on their own two feet and take care of themselves are a threat to the democrat agenda. Any riots against the historically accepted version of law and order are condoned  embraced  and encouraged. they still are the mayor of Atlanta is supposed to be in trouble for what their accusing trump of  I heard from her moth that it was ok because that s what insurance is for  these are the people that shouldn t be in government New Years Eve federal buildings in at least 2 cities were attacked and how much condemnation from Democrats

https   abcnews.go.com US wireStory vandals damage federal buildings philadelphia arrested 75006819 What riot  It was 93  peaceful. Any violence was done by fringe agitators and not representative of the group  also probably plants trying to make them look bad. It only started when a congeesman was spotted at a gasoline station and they did was Maxine told them to do. It was going to be the D.C. CHAZ  and I thought that was a good thing. Fortunately since it was a protest it actually prevented the spread of Corona. Plus the only shooting that was done was by the police  which always means the victim was innocent and deserves a mural.

Checking Georgia s law on this a homeless person can go to any Indigent Resource Provider for an id and to register to vote.  Examples of such places are churches and advocacy groups.

Good often emerges from even the worst situations. The good emerging from this one is that the veil is completely lifted  the election provides transcendent clarity. Many have already peeked under the veil. Those who refuse to grasp what is now appallingly obvious are too dense  deluded or corrupt to be of concern  and should be left to whatever ignominious ends fate has in store for them.

This election has made it made perfectly  clear that we live in a corruptocracy. We can t vote corruptocracy out  any more than the people of the Soviet Union could have voted out  communism  also a corruptocracy  and for the same reason  the vote itself is fundamentally corrupt. If Trump loses  it clearly discredits the notion embraced by the losers of every election  wait til next time. Next time is likely to be even more corrupt.

Freedom is not free  and neither are  individual rights  the rule of law  capitalism  peace  or the  opportunity to build a better life.

There are undoubtedly millions of disgusted Trump supporters who would embrace a split in a heartbeat  but peaceful secession is precluded by the fundamental flaw at the core of every collectivist ideology  governments don t produce  they steal. Leeches never desires separation. The blue needs the red  man cannot live on high tech  media  crony capitalism  and finance alone.

Collectivists versus producers. 

If Biden is declared the winner  Covid 19 restrictions are no longer necessary to hamstring the economy  discredit Trump  and justify mail in voting fraud. Thank you for this. It has been completely clear that we are powerless in our choices. I know Trump won  as many in America do. No one voted for Biden  just for or against Trump.

Google reads email and knows all about you.

Google controls the majority of Internet advertising.

Google knows what questions you ask and what you search  and it uses that data to build records of you. Google drives through your neighborhood and photographs your property.

Google has the power to shape political opinion  to reward it and to punish it and to censor it.

Second most dangerous company is Facebook which does some similar things.

Both do this on behalf of the elite and their spy agencies like the CIA. It s about time.  Now they need to do something about it. Google has already committed various human rights violations with their partnership with the CCP and their literal internment and concentration camps.

Think China developed all their human monitoring and tracking technology on their own  Nope. That was all Google.

Google provided China the means to oppress their citizens.

And sooner or later  it s going to be deployed here. Google has viable competition in every space except video  mainly because of people who only post on youtube. There are other video sites but the content isn t there.

I might be biased saying that because I don t use any commercial Google products except youtube. I still use some stuff based on their open source code like an android ROM and chromium occasionally for sites that break in Firefox. And a search sometimes when i want their  bubble  like search for  Walmart hours  and see the local results first. But nothing that requires a Google account. Phillip Morris No contest. They have a tremendous amount of power. More oversight is needed  and maybe they need to be partially nationalized. Facebook seems like a far greater threat.  They shape the opinion of millions of Americans who visit the platform far more than they use Google. Google is broken  They don t even care about the true  If I search who killed JFK Ted s father name doesn t came out  Private companies are incapable of being bad actors cause  free market  will always sort them it out. Only the government can do bad things. Interactions with Google are all  voluntary  as Google can never use force or violence to coerce people.  And so if google ever does anything bad  people will just stop using them and they will lose money and then they will change thier policies on their own.  Monopolies are good things.  The only way for a company to get them is by always providing the highest quality goods and services at the lowest prices.  The ability to achieve monopolies gives companies an incentive to work harder to provide you with the best service.  If you don t like Google s politics  then just stop using their services.  Vote with your dollars.  More government regations are never the answer.  More freedom is the answer.  deleted  I think it s Bill Gates of Hell  Right before or after virtually any Chinese company...

Someone posted it to r TheTrumpZone and then r TheRightCantMeme crossposted it so they could brigade the pro Trump subreddit. r TheRightCantMeme is just a brigade sub. So basically if you have a well behaved child they are far right  Well let s all hope to raise far right children then. Is your child a far left extremist   Look for warning signs 

   Changes gender routinely

   Loves sex with anyone  or anything  and abortion on demand even up to a baby crowning at birth

   Insists everyone else pay for whatever he she wants  including rent  food  medical care  cars  and higher education

   Bewails imminent environmental demise

   Thinks Greta Thunberg and Joe Biden are saviours

   Goes out and destroys everything they don t like  including businesses  statues  and homes  in the name of  equality  and  tolerance  and  unity 

. . . . feel free to add to my list How on earth are these things considered far right   Meh as an architect I like modernism but post modernism is a bit too ridiculous to me. Modernism can look really nice and interesting like what frank Lloyd Wright does with organic architecture in the 40s 60s but towards the 70s modernism got a bit shit where I think students went too abstract and high on it in the next generation of architects. Ah well I still look forward to futuristic modernism tho that still looks pretty neat so far The left  Politicizing persons with character.

It is stunningly obvious some right wing troll posted this. That s extremism to them  So like most people are extremists. It may be funny  but it certainly illustrates quite well how the left attracts mentally ill people with broken values and broken minds. On their own  Darwin would take care of them  but unfortunately they try to take us down with them. And that includes when they run schools and they try to infect our kind with their values. That s absurd and looks like some simple text on a box. What even is this image  Those points describe me and I wanted Warren. This must be sarcastic  I m pretty sure this is parodical in nature. Do you have to have all of those or just a bunch  now I am scared that I might be one and didn t know it. Dang   Yet it s too bad this is not what republicans are know for. It s more like 
Hatred for drugs and drug users 
Possibly addicted to steroids and racism
Collects conservative and biased literature
Most likely misogynistic and possibly beats so for submission
Appreciate the history of stomping out cultures and promoting white dominance
Disdain for culture that points out how y all bunch of terrible ppl How dare you I m so confused.

If this is satire  who is it satire for 

Is this group for making fun of the idiocy of conservatives or for supporting it 

It s not clear. I don t understand.

I mean  obviously  the original meme is stupid  horrendous  and terrible  satire   but are we making fun of it here 

What s going on here 

Is this thread for making fun of the stupidity of conservatives or for supporting it 

It s so unclear. I can t tell if this is page for mocking conservatives or agreeing with them. 

It s so confusing.

Just tell me if this is a pro conservative sub or not  because if it is  this is a very confusing vacuum.

The meme isn t funny. It isn t funny to laugh at. How is it satire if a right wing extremist might actually take it very seriously 

And a conservative would be likely to want their kids to be the way listed in that meme.

This post popped up as a recommendation similar to r liberal  and I m just dumbfounded by what I m reading here.

Final questions 

Are we all in agreement that this meme is stupid 

Is this meme being shared here to make fun of conservatives 

My brain hurts. I don t understand what is going on in this thread.

You people aren t seriously conservatives who find any value in this sort of humor  right 

And how is the meme satire in the first place if it supposedly is 

These are things that right wing conservative parents would actually  take seriously  because they re that stupid and insane. Hell of a joke. Hitler youth espoused some of those ideals though I guess  to be fair.  Literature   Not sure right wing conservative rednecks can even read. To be fair.  deleted ",

This article doesn t rebut the argument that the gender pay gap is a myth in any serious way. That argument is probably best laid out in  this Prager U video   https   youtu.be 1oqyrflOQFc  which argues that it ultimately comes down to the choices men  amp  women make. Even when going into the same field w  the same skill level  guys choose to work longer hours  doing more high risk high reward tasks   amp  most importantly work more when they have their first kid while women tend to work less. The article tries to argue that since men earned  10k more after school even when taking the same classes that this is evidence of a pay gap. It isn t   men  amp  women are made differently in order to complement one another  and because of this they make different choices that lead to different pay How accurate is this article  I m a conservative btw I don t know if I ve been lied to about the gender pay gap.

The CD of greatest hits in the back of the book   All cops are bastards    There are fascists everywhere  and  is that a peaceful protestor   are particularly cool. LOL. I wish he  any  president was this smart. And even more ironic is Biden did say on camera that he had the best vote rigging operation in US history. Isn t Babylonbee a satire site  Lol no one and I mean no one thinks Joe Biden did anything  is doing anything or ever will do anything. If      Looks like he took a page from OJ Simpson s book when he published  If I did it  Is this actually real 

What do mean  if  you rigged it 

YOU DID RIG IT YOU LYING RACIST AHOLE   ",

t3_kp8r32,Democrat Officials Are Already Lying About Upcoming Pro Trump Rally In D.C.    Claim that the event is being backed by  extremists ,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/kp8r32/democrat_officials_are_already_lying_about/,"So... I don t know what will happen on the 6th.  I ve seen moderate and sane people that I know talk about wanting to attend and I ve also seen SOME people talk about wanting the rally to become violent somehow.

It is my hope and prayer that the rally doesn t turn violent on behalf of the Trump people.

The last pro Trump DC rally saw Antifa marching behind a banner that said   It takes a bullet to bash a fash. 

There was bad behavior on the part of Proud Boys who stole and destroyed  black lives matter  signs.

But that was far from  trying to burn historic black churches  which is what some of them were accused of.

I read accounts from folks who were there who said that the gathering in DC was peaceful  and meant to be and there was even a family atmosphere and kids present and then when the rally was over  DC police blocked the attendees from leaving by various avenues and instead shunted them down one exit road into the arms of waiting antifa groups who tried to pick people out of the larger crowd and harass them.

The antifa subreddit says that they are ready to be at this rally because they think that the Proud Boys will be there  but  incognito .

From what I can tell the Jan 6 rally is not being sponsored by some radical  racist group.

But ... of course the left thinks that every Trump supporter is a radical racist.

It seems to me that this will be the future of America.  If groups of people on the right try to demonstrate  it will be labeled some extremist rally.

However  months ago... for nights in a row...radical extremists tried to siege the White House and injured 60 secret service agents.  If THE RIGHT had done anything like that during Obama s term  they would have been correctly labeled domestic terrorists.

So... there are already leftist domestic terrorists in DC... and THEY ACTUALLY tried to set a historic church on fire ...

I hope everyone keeps a level head on the 6th... does NOT seek to perpetrate any violence and has situational awareness of everything around them and I hope that DC authorities handle things better than they did the last time.

Other than that...I don t know what to say. You could have just said the first 5 words and it would be true about anything they say. I have a feeling things are going to be really weird. Antifa will be there  so technically they re are right The liberal fucks never stop. It is backed by extremists... Extremely Patriotic Americans    So blm and antifa. Democrat officials are full of crap lol The Left loves to label your average conservatives who remain peaceful as  extremists   while ignoring the violence and destruction done by their own side. One conservative youtuber I watch went to a rally in DC and said the people there were great  they love America and want the best. Everything was going well until the Lefties showed up and started harassing everyone  including older folks and families with kids. Just terrible. Well  as you know  anytime you question the Left s  authority  it is considered an extreme view  particularly if you cite the Constitution while doing the questioning. BS  MAGA2020   Yes. I ve predicted they will try to position the rally as extremists  to discredit it. And possibly there will be false flag violence events. The Christmas RV bombing was too conveniently close to Jan 6 and yet the media have been very quiet about it instead of going on for weeks.

I believe the Dem city leadership in DC will clamp down on the Trump supporters while going easy on the left s upcoming efforts. There may be a shooting  to give motivation to shut down the crowds. The deep state isn t comfortable with the exposure of their fraud in the elections  so they will want to reroute what they can. Democrats lying is the standard now for their existence. You have to cover your eyes and ears now to be  democrat. Only the ignorant and evil would want to see them rule us.",

t3_kpu7zk,The WaPo Trump phone call  my review ,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/kpu7zk/the_wapo_trump_phone_call_my_review/,"The funny thing about the recounts is there is only one person who knew any of the counts.... Yep . raffleberger  it was a top down  each station reported to him he then told them their numbers. That is extremely odd. Only county to count their own numbers got 5 different counts the 5 times they put ballots through machines  coffee county Lies  lies  and more lies. The purpose of this call is very clear to anyone that listens to what Trump said  in plain language  repeatedly. He s pushing debunked conspiracy theories and threatening election officials with legal and political repercussions if they don t  recalculate  and  find  the votes he wants in order to declare him the winner.

The full audio makes what Trump said WORSE  not better. Context doesn t save him  if anything it reinforces exactly what Trump was demanding.

The assertions that there were shenanigans in Fulton county or anywhere else in the battleground states have been investigated  hand recounts were performed and they didn t change the results. Trump LOST in every one of the states in question fair and square. This recorded conversation lays it out for all to see. Trump will do ANYTHING  even blatantly break the law in order to try to remain in power. The only question is how many other telephone calls were made with similar demands that weren t recorded  or haven t been released yet. there is certainly no question that many of Trump s ardent supporters and sycophantic simps like Ted Cruz will excuse literally anything he does.","  The WaPo Trump phone call  in full 

 

As typical  WaPo led with the headline that Trump wanted to  find 11 780 votes   and people ran with it as if he was asking Brad Raffensperger to alter votes or make some up somehow. He did not.

I have listened to the  ENTIRE  https   t.co ZRCu7p74Le amp 1  phone call. Trump starts by laying out every case for fraud discrepancies issues and the number of votes estimated to be affected. They go over the Fulton Co video  the stopping of counting issues  etc.

He then says he lost by 11 779 votes  and wants to  find 11 780  and that each of these issues he laid out more than covers that difference.

Brad Raffenspergerjust retorts  your data is wrong  and claims they have  other data . But then Trump s team says they have not received any of it though they have repeatedly requested it from him. Six times. It has not been provided by them to this date.

Brad doesn t want to look into Fulton Co  and that is the key issue. Trump says  essentially   if you would look at Fulton Co  we win . That is the context missing from the snippet WaPo released initially.

The purpose of this call was to lay out the numbers Trump claims and to get GA to just look into them. There is no request to make up new numbers. There are requests for the data Brad claims to have and to actually audit Fulton Co where the most shenanigans occurred.

Trump is convinced he won GA  easily  and doesn t even want to bring Dominion into it to overturn the posted result. He just wants GA to actually audit Fulton Co and toss the votes that were illegally counted. They want to sit down with the SoS office and go over the numbers together and see which numbers are accurate.

That s it."

There is no lie  we all heard the same call. Guy thinks he s a mafia boss  gt For  as Trump says   Because  what s the difference between winning the election by two votes and winning it by half a million votes  

Everything. 

In one version  you re just shooting for a goal to secure a victory  regardless of the facts are.

In the other version  you want the voices of all the Americans that voted to be heard accurately. 

That s the problem with this  Trump doesn t care about having the voice of the people heard. He s not doing this because he thinks people were silenced. He s doing this because he needs to win. Instead of   we need to make sure this election is accurate and everyone s vote is correctly counted  it s  just get me enough votes to win  I don t care about anything else. 

 gt The voters can t be trusted. The poll workers can t be trusted. The voting machines can t be trusted. The media can t be trusted. The United States Attorney General can t be trusted. The Republicans in charge of state s election can t be trusted. The lower courts can t be trusted. The appellate courts can t be trusted. The Supreme Court can t be trusted.

You ll be charged with sedition just as trump will. Attorney general of GA already investigating. Wow  now there are Dems asking the FBI to investigate.

 gt  As members of Congress and former prosecutors  we believe Donald Trump engaged in solicitation of  or conspiracy to commit  a number of election crimes   Reps. Ted Lieu of California and Kathleen Rice of New York told Wray in a letter on Monday.  We ask you to open an immediate criminal investigation into the president. 

Who wants to wager the FBI will open an investigation here when they ve refused to do so for any other allegation of  election crimes    Pieces of complete garbage  all of them.  removed  I heard about this new  scandal ... read some of the  damning  snippets of the call and went   So he said the same things he has been TWEETING for weeks and now it s a scandal because he s saying them on the phone  

He s discussing the resolution of a LAWSUIT AGAINST Georgia.

He s telling Raffensburger   I believe that I won by a LOT of votes... 

    We have ... anywhere from 250 300 000 ballots were dropped mysteriously into the rolls. 


    We think that if you check the signatures   a real check of the signatures going back in Fulton County you ll find at least a couple of hundred thousand of forged signatures. ... 

     I n the 50s of thousands ... that s people that went to vote and they were told they can t vote because they ve already been voted for. 

    You had 18 325 vacant address voters.  The address was vacant and they re not allowed to be counted. 

 gt Trump pointed to 4 925 illegal out of state voters  2 326 absentee ballots from vacant addresses  5 000 dead people voting  and improperly handled drop boxes.  And he brought up the allegations that Georgia is shredding evidence as fast as it can.

He s telling Raffensburger   I won... and you can t just DENY these allegations.  You need to INVESTIGATE these allegations...  But you can listen to the whole thing so how  Lmfao holy shit Since the entire phone call was longer than the click bait headline it s safe bet stuff is parsed  out of context or misinterpreted. The  media . Hmmm. I think I know who s lying. Trump did not ask them to  find  votes. Listen to the context. He talks about the hundreds of thousands of potentially illegal votes cast in Georgia. He was telling the lazy Secretary of State that he only needed to  find  enough of the fraudulent votes to flip the result back...

So shouldn t that be considered an  epidemic  and the governments continue to enforce social distancing and require every male to wear a condom  Our descendants will look back at us as monsters. But no one gives a shit about that. SMH All lives matter. Except babies in the womb. It is interesting that here in Australia some of the progressive church leaders are pro abortion. One leader described it as not so much of a spiritual religious issue but merely a public health issue. Very sad.  removed  Sad I ll never get why so many conservatives are anti choice. Are there too many abortions  Yes. Do we need better use of birth control to prevent this  Absolutely  Abortion is not favorable from a health perspective and so developing safer non hormonal birth control should take priority. Making birth safer  America has a despicably high mortality rate for women in childbirth   and cheaper  it costs  10K just to have a baby in a hospital  needs to be a priority too. So let s focus on that instead of just whining like the liberals do. Abortion will never be illegal  nor should it be. Safe  legal and rare. My question is  if the fetus is a baby  do the mothers carrying them get the extra stimulus check  Do they get to write the fetus off as a dependent on their taxes  What does the law say is a baby  When does the law start counting that life  If they truly believed they were children and not just a fetus then the answer would be yes. Shut everything down  no school  print money  no jobs  no outlet. Yes  people are going to find ways to not have kids  sorry to say. Pretty sure this is part of there great reset and agenda 21 goals to reduce the human population. Wear a mask.

t3_koi8ux,President Donald Trump s Space Legacy Will Last for Light Years,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/koi8ux/president_donald_trumps_space_legacy_will_last/,"light years is a distance  not a unit of time. Plus another President can undo it. Using space achievements for presidents is kind of annoying because its almost never the current administration that put the now finished programs in place.

Like how this article says under almost all of Obamas term we outsourced getting to the ISS to the russians but thanks to trump during his term in 2020 we launched people there ourselves again for the first time. But that commercial crew program was started in 2010 under Obama  everything was pretty much solidly set in stone by 2017 and the companies were testing their  near finished  rockets and crew capsules by then. Trump isn t to praise for it. It was the commercial crew program so it wasn t nasa who designed built the rocket either  it was SpaceX and boeing still trying to . Parts of the program were kind of made by Bush in the 2000s so maybe he gets a bit of credit too. Just shows how long these projects take that its rediculous to praise the current president for them.

It would be like Biden taking credit for all of the projects trump started that are due to finish in the next 0 8 years. Of course that would be rubbish. But we cant have it both ways. Either Obama gets credit for the commercial crew program  or Biden gets credit for the programs trump started. Anything else is hyprocritical.

Praising the presidents at all is kinda dumb imo anyway. They kinda set the course but then its the NASA admin that makes it happen  its congress that provides the funding. And for this specific project it s SpaceX who made it happen. Without them there wouldn t have been any crew launched from USA in 2020. It was their rocket  and their capsule and their everything. Nasa just provided funding at this point.",

Until they can can just train harder. Well technically equality laws would mean everyone competes against everyone and the best are the ones who win.  These laws are not about equality but about giving women places where they only have to compete against other women  not against men. If we allow females who were born male to compete in female sports  are we not allowing males who were born female to compete in those same events   

As a female athlete  I would be worried about serious injury in certain sports if I were competing against a trans woman. My fear would be that there is no truly safe spot for biologically female athletes to compete  thus creating less desire for girls to participate in sports. 

I think this is one of those things where it s not as black and white as people think That wouldn t be equality though... Absolutely they should. In the UK 3 women are murdered every week.

Personally  I  hear socialism and think of people breaking into zoos to eat the camels Yeah  indoctrination at college  I can speak from experience. Switzerland.... is about as far from socialism as you can get

Then again socialists really arnt the brightest bunch That s not socialism that s capitalism with extensive social welfare  You are not entitled to your opinion. You are entitled to your informed opinion. No one is entitled to be ignorant. 

  Harlan Ellison Millennials in general are idiots. They think free shit I believe in real capitalism.  Capitalism where people are free to do as they like with their capital.  Capital is not just money and it can be argued money is the least valuable form of capital.  A man s education  the sweat of his brow and fruit of his labors are also capital.  The union worker punching a time clock at a factory is a capitalist.

The issues we argue about is the perceived fairness of what each man s capital is worth.  Sometimes this difference is due to intellect  competence and how hard a man works and other times due to the fickle nature of what is valued in the market.

What Proglydites do is argue about  fairness  but  fairness  is defined by them.  Their solutions are to claim collective ownership and the select a class of people to Guard fairness to ensure their  fair  structure is maintained.  Almost all left wing liberalism that falls in this category as well as socialists and communists  btw which includes fascism  get this idea in some fashion from Plato s Republic a well thought out insightful treatise that is ultimately fundamentally flawed.  

Plato envisioned a ruling class taught to be wise and ethical.  Empirical evidence though shows that wealth or education does not reduce the numbers of people that commit fraud.  As the 1st century Roman poet and satirist Jovenal put it   Who Guards the Guardians  

This is why communism socialism fascism and centralized planning does not work.  No one group of people is more or less ethical than another so you just create a ruling class that rules everything.

The problem with the US and other 1st world societies is they want some kind of safety net and are not motivated to fund and help in charities to do it.  They decide just to give politicians power over people s lives.

I wrote a paper for graduate school on basic income before I had heard of the term.  My idea therefore is not Andrew Yang s as it came from my more right leaning roots.

My goal was to provide the base safety net liberals had convinced everyone was needed without the overbearing regulation and control over the people helped they insist is needed.

I counted up the amount taken for welfare programs and tax collected from  SOcial Security Pensions  SSN  and it worked out to 6 grand per adult in the country.  It dawned on me combined with the money for EArned Incone from the iRS we could abolish all these programs and get rid of the bureaucrats enforcing them and simply give every US citizen ten grand regardless of wealth.  Eventually people will pay that money back through income  taxes but regardless of how much you make you get that ten grand check.

This would save money and more importantly get the government bureaucrats out of our lives.

Need to go to college.  You get ten grand a year use that.

Why are we not helping the homeless  what did they do with their ten grand  if they abuse it and can t take care of themselves it goes to shelters who will take care of them and they must work to show independence if they want to be responsible for themselves.  Which might include psychological counseling the left complains there is no money for.

It is not enough money to live comfortably but should be enough to eat.

What further charity is needed can be provided locally without government.

I knew this idea might have some merit because all the outspoken liberals in class hated the idea.

The number one problem with government welfare is not the money taken from us.  We can always try to earn more.  The problem is the power and control over our lives because of the regulation that comes with it  Imagine going through life as a retarded millennial These things should be debated.. honestly.. by a free legislature  no judicial decrees or executive decisions. But none of those places are socialist. They re Democracies living in a bubble under US and NATO who built nanny states in the wake of WW2 when the entire continent was destroyed and literally everything fell under the umbrella of government. There wasn t private much of anything post WW2 across the continent so yea it made sense that if people needed to see a doctors needed food or water that they d go to the military government because there wasn t any other option. And again that was also in a bubble of allied occupation  and economic backing from the US which helped jump start their economies.

t3_koi83m,Looking Back On A Year Of Mass Homeschooling,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/koi83m/looking_back_on_a_year_of_mass_homeschooling/,"It s really interesting how parents are splitting on this. 

I m a teacher in Florida  so I m coming from the teacher perspective and we are back in school physically And parents have the option to keep their kids home and choose online. It seems like the parents who care are jumping all aboard homeschooling  because they realize that their child has the opportunity to have one on one attention and be more successful. On the other hand  there s a giant swath of parents who are complaining out the ass about their child s success. 

I teach two online classes  one that is honors and one that is not honors. Almost all of my honors kids have A s and B s. Almost all of my not honors kids have D s and F s. All of these children have parents who have to go to work. They are all in high school  they are all in 10th grade. Why are some succeeding where others are not  I teach the exact same curriculum for both classes  and the exact same curriculum for my in person classes. The parents who are angry and complaining are the parents of the students who are not turning in work  not attending class  and not doing anything to be successful. The honors kids would be just a successful if they were in the classroom  because they are motivated intrinsically and they want to learn and they care about being successful.

On the other hand  if I were an elementary school parent I would be much more apt to be upset. And elementary school child requires way different things than a high school aged kid does. I would expect that I could leave my 15 year old at home and then when I get home  they went to school all day and completed their assignments. Of course  as a parent  it is your responsibility to check that your child has completed all of their assignments  and with an online gradebook  there is no excuse for you not to know what your kid is doing unless your child s teachers are incompetent  and I understand that some of my colleagues absolutely are incompetent  I work with them 

All in all  it s very telling to see who is succeeding and who is complaining. It s about the environment at home. Even if the parent works all day  the child understands that there was an expectation that they get up and get dressed and go to online school  whereas the kids who are failing online would be feeling in person  because of the lack of parental expectations. I know that as a teacher I am bending over backwards for online kids  extending the due dates  offering one on one tutoring on video chat during my lunches  Messaging kids individually who have dropped off or are struggling not turning in assignments  and spending several hours a week converting physical materials into something that works in the digital realm  IE  projects  escape rooms  posters  all of the  fun  things that I do in the physical classroom that my kids enjoy 

I want to homeschool my kids when I have them  for exactly this reason  I know the people I work with and the expectations and the indoctrination communicate it  and as one teacher doing my best to mitigate that  I can only do so much. I understand that I am at my child s best teacher  because I am the person who knows my child the best and I am the person with the most investment in my child s success.

TLDR  I think the people who are seizing this opportunity to take back control of their child s education are going to benefit from an all around a terrible situation. I think the people who whine and complain that they aren t paid to be their child s teachers are the same people who are baffled when their child is failing when they are sitting in a classroom. It s all down to parental expectations and actually paying attention to what your kid is doing.",

Very few military would support Biden. Doesn t come close to the polling more like opposite. This stuff is so crazy. The voter fraud is so evident.

1. that some military ballots were faked  printed and used  never mailed
2. Now add that to the ballots purposely printed to be rejected by scanners and adjudicated.

Why wouldn t this be all over the MSM  Even CNN would cover this. Not to mention our Government publicly talking about it. Welp  no media is covering this  I mean nobody.  Maybe it ll take a day or 2 to get momentum  IDK  this seems kinda big not to cover.  Only article I ve seen from a somewhat credible news site is OAN...so not sure what happens next.  

https   www.oann.com doj adviser lott trump votes subtracted biden votes inflated  This is good to know but  it still depends on what Congress is willing to do  not what they should do. If they are white hat hackers  then surely they must ve done this while recording it... that is typically how it is done. Then the results  ie exploits  are shared  if not publicly then at least at a high level on the methodology with a request from the company to remunerate them for the work done to bring the exploits to their attention. Could be true but the article needs more substantiation. Also. No machine anywhere is unhackable   there just has been no evidence thus far of hacking during this election. This article makes me nervous from a journalistic perspective as well as a scientific perspective. It is either bad at connecting the dots or good at jumping to conclusions.

Journalistic issue  the premise immediately goes from an event to a conclusion based solely on the editor s perspective.  This can happen  therefore Georgia is compromised.  Georgia is a shit show  but there is nothing to correlate the events  the dates  or the occurrence to the voter fraud. Connect the dots    Is there direct correlation between what was found in the experiment and what occurred on November 3 or not  

Scientific issue  the information has not been corroborated by a second source  and the primary source has not been vetted.  A white hat hacker said he got in  but who is this person  Who can confirm this statement  I am certain this is a feasible process but the article presents good knowledge in a piss poor way. Abhorrent that this isn t being covered. How to put pressure on them to show it   But I thought the only way to win was voting in the GA runoff race   

The GOP will be losing a lot of members if they don t stand up now Like it s going to matter. SCOTUS won t see it. Congress will ignore it and if Pence doesn t stop this fraud  we are fucked. If Pence is deep state  like I keep hearing today  we are over. This is absolutely ludicrous... nobody covering government proceedings now  No details on the Georgia Senate Judiciary site either The only way to get the  evidence  they want is to force confessions out of the perpetrators.  But that won t happen. MSM will simply say this has been  debunked . When a liberal hears the word debunked it has the same effect as a microwave does on cousin Eddie. They piss themselves and forget who they are for 30 minutes. Haters will still ask for evidence.  Give this guy the original ballots  he displayed there were 2 sets  one with a barcode  and one without that went to specific counties  he also proved that the machine reading scanning identifier was located in a position that would make the ballot unreadable for the ballots with a barcode...the majority GOP county ballots. he also showed that at the bottom of the ballot there was a COUNTY LOCATOR for a ballot.....

Jovan Hutton Pulitzer Testimony   GA Senate Judiciary Committee

 amp  x200B 

Watch this you will see it all....I suggest see it all  but it gets good at about the 31 00 mark Does the expert witness in this testimony demonstrate that he has access to the voting machines  or is it just a claim  Are the tabulation machines in the same configuration now that they were in when tabulating votes  What credentials does Jovan Pulitzer have that makes him an expert witness  He s claiming to be able to scan 500 000 votes in two hours for creases and machine marks to determine if the votes were counted by rogue vote tabulators. Does he have any evidence or studies that show he has the technology and expertise to do this  All this proves is someone lied about the reliability of these machines  it does not prove the election was hacked. This is a win but it s likely to little to late. it s not like this will get any attention outside of right wing circles. Just because it can be hacked doesn t necessarily mean it WAS hacked at time of the election. They ll need to prove that it was hacked on Election Day.

We must know who wrote in the fat  and trim them out of Congress  This was very unspecific.

I was really hoping for more detail than  the bill had special interest crap in it .  We already knew that.

What I want to know is who put it there. Not only is Ava Pelosi ugly  she s a nasty  vile  evil  racist  elitist  radical Marxist  as well as a drunk  dumber than a box of rocks  hates America  and thinks we the people are beneath her. This is called Log rolling....

I got this from the FEE web page

Congress is expected to vote on the second largest bill in US history    today      2.5 trillion   and as of about 1pm  members don t even have  the legislative text of it yet.

 People are right to see that tying COVID relief to defense provisions  is  well  stupid. But there s a phenomenon that helps explain why this  happens. It s called  logrolling  https   en.wikipedia.org wiki Logrolling .

Logrolling is essentially the trading of favors among legislators for  mutual benefit. Bills often get passed by winning the support of  lawmakers by including provisions that benefit their special interests   but which may not align with any public good. As a result  successful  legislation tends to be chock full of special interest spending.

This trap is highlighted by  public choice  economics  which assumes  that politicians vote to forward their own interests just like everyone  else. In this case  however  they impose costs on the country in  exchange for a big benefit to a special interest group who supports  them.

If you re wondering how a vote for COVID relief for Americans becomes  tied to  10 million for gender programs in Pakistan and hundreds of  millions of dollars in defense for another country  look to the  incentives lurking within government institutions.  Maybe it is a payment to Pakistan military for helping Democrat party and Obama thugs cheat in the elections  Especially with a country thats 2nd largest Muslim population. And Muslims believe the Quran is perfectly preserved  equal to a Christian belief of the virgin birth  therefore women will always be second class citizens  based on the Quran ... so we are tossing 10 million to the wind.

Assholes  There was seriously someone on r Illinois who asked  don t we want women to have equality with men   Luckily someone else told him her off  so I didn t have to. I mean  Senator Graham advocated for it  It is not hard to understand guys. COVID relief bill 

https   www.ncsl.org LinkClick.aspx fileticket aEYRUI0 Jqw 3d amp portalid 1   

is a different bill than the one with foreign aid in it. One can pass without the other. There was no foreign aid in the COVID relief bill. America has more than enough money to pass the two bills even with the 2k checks amendment. It s absolutely no problem except for some republican senators who believe no aid should be given ever  to regular people  corporations and the ultra rich are prime for handouts  even in the face of a pandemic that no one could predict. Which is obviously shortsighted.

Please  stay the F outta Texas. Considering he s a murderer this is not very surprising. Nobody in NY wants Cuomo to be Governor. Nobody in NYC wants de Blasio to be Mayor.
A newspaper ran an article before the last mayoral election stating that everyone hates de Blasio but tough  he will still be elected mayor. And he was  despite better challengers.

Our Republic s elections are a sham. Makes no difference who you vote for  the political machine will make sure the  right  person wins all the votes. 

The legislators pass laws contrary to the constitution without even reading them. And if they don t  the governor has  the right  to declare a state of emergency and pass them by executive fiat anyway. As for SCOTUS  don t hold your breath. You have 9 justices waiting to  hear a backlog of a billion challenges. 

End rant. Cali Gov Nuisance is going to be upset you picked Cuomo over him. Raise your hand if this surprises you....   crickets   I would nominate Tim Walz for worst governor  but I d be fine if Cuomo won. I thought they talking about Newsom. Close i guess. OMG   Why has no one gotten rid of him yet   Like the worst booger on your finger  I don t know Insley gives this idiot a good run for worst Governor. I m ok with that.

Oh the horror. why is he doing this  So I m still very confused about all this. Please feel to correct me if I m wrong. 
1  originally  Trump thinks the stimulus package has too much fluff. Says it needs to cut the fluff and raise it from  600 person to  2000 person. 
2  Trump decides to sign it anyway with the fluff and only  600 person but vows to send more money to Americans. Why did he do this   
3  Congress decides to try and send  2000 to Americans. But McConnell blocks it.  Why would he do this 

Again  I might be completely wrong about the order or content for f these events. I m just trying to figure it all out. If anyone can help  I d appreciate it. I can really have an opinion until I understand exactly what happened. He s blocking because he wants to repeal 230 which gives a shield to internet companies and if he s successful this is going back fire. 

Basically 230 gives internet companies a shield from what its user post. If say someone goes on twitter and says  I m going shoot up this school  and that someone goes and shoots up that school twitter can t be held liable for the actions of that person.

Now if Twitter WANTS to ban that user they 100  have the right to do that  or they don t have too.

However if the shield is repealed internet companies will have no choice but to get SUPER STRICT and ban all kinds of people from posting. Hell Trump would have been banned from twitter without the shield. Many conservative speakers who have advocated for violence or hate speech would have been banned.

And obviously I m sure some folks will point out to some left idealogy people that have said that horrible things  those people would be banned too.

Also I could see a lot of companies going  Eh fuck it we shutting down  as I understand it reddit isn t profitable. Whats to say the investors in reddit go  O we now have to spend a lot of money monitoring everything that said among our millions of users  That s going cost us a lot lets just shut down the site  Back in my day  we worked for our money. So conservatives want a stimulus bill without pork

House sends Congress  2000 checks no pork

Mitch blocks immediate vote and says he ll add section 230 repeal and election fraud task force to it before voting

Will it have any effect on who is in power or what they do   No. The media will actually be all over this once Biden is sworn in  this will be what they use to get Harris in as President.

They lost every  toss up  race in the House and no Republican incumbent lost. By all indications  it was a Republican wave election.

The statistical and historical anomalies surrounding Trump s loss are unprecedented. Election meddling undoubtedly occurred in the current disputed states  and other blue states that were on the verge of turning red. The refusal of transparency in terms of auditing electronic voting machines and signature matching on absentee ballots also raises red flags. 

Despite the general unpopularity of the Democratic platform  they feel no need to respond to the general electorate if they can continue to rig elections. They hold voters in contempt and resent that they must be elected at all. What am I missing here  Where is there actionable proof of election fraud that would overturn the result. Don t reply condescendingly. It s an actual question. They won t have to relinquish power. If they stole this election they ll be able to steal all future elections. There s nothing in this article but propaganda. The author uses big words in places they don t need to be to obfuscate the point that no point is being made. 

It s very clearly a piece of propoganda. No evidence  research  polls  tests  or analysis  just some dude writing out his thoughts. And not even original ones  at that. Shit that the media has been talking about since November. Hardly worth reading.

And  lol just finished it  the 1984 quote is easily the most lackluster. Like  of all the themes of that book  relenquishing power is not one of them.  removed   removed  Y all a bunch of sheep man. Fucking idiots. Can t believe you believe that the election was any kind of fraudulent. It s just insane that you all would just believe his narcissistic bullshit so he can feel better about himself. It s the biggest case of mass delusion I can think of in history. It s like you re all just sucking his dick  and you love getting cum in your face. 

Please Perma ban me  would love if this was my last message to you all fucking morons. 

If you think the election was fraudulent  you re a fucking idiot. Fuck all you. If they get away with it this time they will try to do it every election and the Republican party will be no more. That s the real goal.  deleted  They will never lose another Pres election if they get away with it this time. the processes in which this election was validated is the same of every other election  if not more secure due to media and popular scrutiny.

This article is a perfect example of why I stopped subscribing to Reason magazine after   30 years.

The article correctly criticizes the NYT.

The article correctly criticizes Galligan.

Then...wait...no criticism of the school  who expelled the girl. There should have been fire breathing outrage that an institution run by supposedly serious people would bow to mob idiocy like this. All the writer does is describe the school s actions.

THEN...well well well. Yep  you guessed it  the article decides to criticize a conservative article calling Galligan a  moral monster   with the argument  hey  teens do dumb stuff...amiright   .

So  as the dust settles on this piece  we find a conservative magazine getting more criticism than the cowardly and shameful actions of the university that expelled the girl. WTF  

Whats more  in its zeal to critique the conservative article  Reason engages in moral equivalency gymnastics. I agree that teenagers should get some space. They do impulsive  dumb shit  most of it harmless or nearly so. I certainly did. I agree this kind of stuff shouldn t hang over their entire lives.

That is not the case here. Galligan planned this for a year  more   . PLANNED IT. He further had plenty of opportunities to regret it  apologize for it  or even tell the NYT to buzz off. He did none of those things. So  this isn t some dumb  impulsive  harmless action. No. it is a deliberate  planned attempt to ruin someone s life. And its working. That makes calling Galligan a  moral monster  spot on accurate. Why did they hide the holocaust from the American people  Jimmy Galligan r iamatotalpieceofshit",

Let s start with Loeffler.  When Isackson resigned for health reasons  Kemp appointed the wife of a wealthy donor to fill the seat instead of Doug Collins who had shown through out the bogus Mueller witch hunt and sham impeachment that he truly was a Conservative and supportive of the President.  

Loeffler had no political experience  just money donated to Kemp.  If Kemp had named Collins to the seat there wouldn t have been a split in the GOP votes.  What has been reported is that Collins got 20   Loeffler got 25.9   or 45.9  of the reported vote.

In the Perdue race  the final tally it shows he had 49.7  to Ossoff s 47.9 .

Now if Raffensperger and Kemp had not entered into an un lawful consent decree with co Governor Stacey Abrams and had instead enforced the Georgia election laws that are on the books  it is highly likely that not only would there have been no question Trump won Georgia  but both Collins and Perdue would likely have won their respective Senate seats without a run off either.

 gt March 6  2020

 gt I was wandering around a massive expo quite recently  when I chanced upon a seminar on the future of law in a world run by blockchain. It was by far the least populous of the events  so I slipped in for a breather from the frenzy elsewhere. On the panel  a lanky engineer was haranguing a lawyer. His thesis was as crude as it is common. Blockchain  and the whole complex of emerging technologies would wipe out what he called  the monstrous inefficiency of the legal system  forever. The learned professor of the law on the other side of the panel hung his head and openly begged pardon of the engineers.  You engineers must really forgive us lawyers   he whimpered  we just love inefficiency in all that we do .

 gt The call for efficiency in law is not new. As in other fields  it goes back to the scientific and industrial revolutions  and the truly misguided attempt to replicate the success of the methodologies of hard science in other domains. It was in World War 2 that this effort reached the apex of its stupidity  and the nadir of its criminality. For technocracy  that twisted progeny of scientism and positive law  was to achieve the full banality of its evil in those terrible years. A relatively recent book by Edwin Black shows the intimate links between IBM  or at least its German subsidiaries  and the Nazi government. No surprise. When did large organisations baulk at a lucrative deal with a sanguinary tyrant  But it was this intimate link between IBM and the Nazis that made the Holocaust possible. Deutsche Hollerith Maschinen Gesellschaft  a subsidiary of IBM from 1922  made the tabulator  a data miner  and the sorter  data processor  that the Nazis used to carry out the population surveys by which they were able to identify and round up so many millions of people so  efficiently. This is the point. Atrocious violations of human rights on such scale are impossible without efficiency  either of the machine  or of human organisation.

 gt There are obvious reasons why the engineer venerates efficiency. More efficient machines do more for lower cost. This very efficiency  which is the cause of the great deflation of computation power in terms of price  may be the invisible factor keeping our tremendously inefficient  inflation based financial system from implosion. But this does not make efficiency a moral  legal  or yet a political value  but is in fact the very antithesis of these values. To find out why  we need to take the road to Rome. Again.

 gt The origins of the Roman Republic are shrouded in myth  but a convenient demarcation point is 509 B.C.  when the Romans threw their royal family out of the city. Then started a process of constitutional development that lies at the foot of all our institutions. The foundation of this constitution was the firm belief of the Romans that concentrated power is tyranny  and that tyranny is the great possible evil. To diminish this risk as much as possible  the Roman political system was specifically designed to ensure that no positive action was possible except with consensus that was well nigh universal. Moreover  its parts were set up to disrupt this consensus as much as possible. It was therefore a system specifically hard coded for inefficiency. The default setting of the system was inaction  and any attempt at action had to run a course of such gut busting inefficiency that even bringing it up for discussion was a minor miracle.

 gt The Roman Republic was a democracy with the major branches of power ruthlessly divided. Law sprung from the people in assembly. This assembly also elected the executive and judiciary. Power was held for a single year only. The office of the Prime Minister was held by two individuals  the Consuls  for just one year  with no possibility of running for the office again in the following year. Each consul had an unlimited veto over his partner  making it trivial to deadlock any consular initiative. Later  the veto would be acquired by other officials at all levels  producing a gauntlet of vetos that could  and did  paralyse political power with effortless ease. The Senate was a body of ex members of the executive and the judiciary  and its role was to advise current officials and refer requests for legislative action to the popular assemblies.

 gt Despite the democratic virtues of Republican inefficiency  it brought its own danger  the risk of instability. To avert this danger  the Romans developed a system of law separate from and above any single branch  institution and office of the state  and operating consistently with its own logic. Law was made by the people in assembly  administered by a very limited executive  and adjudicated by an elected office with its own cadre of specialists. The law was codified  disputes were adjudicated in court according to statute and the internal logic of the system. Legal proceedings became processes of forensic investigation  systematized interpretation  due process  and logical discovery. It was intended to provide a level playing field in which every person was equal before the impersonal machinery of the law  and the merits of the case were determined by data  and the logic of the system  not by whim and caprice. Even the vaunted democracies of the Greeks were lacking in comparison  for Greek lawsuits were determined by what was virtually trial by combat  but by oratory instead of the sword.

 gt The Roman legal system is difficult to appreciate except by contrast with other systems. Where law is Rome  it is protracted  expensive  long winded  inefficient even  but demonstrably fair within reasonable parameters of tolerance. Where law is not Rome  it is but the caprice of the monarch  or the mob  and legal proceedings but the liturgy through which this capricious power expresses itself. And the mark of this capricious power is efficiency   quick execution in all its senses. Efficient politics and efficient law are the orb and sceptre of tyrants.

 gt Emerging tech and innovative technology  including blockchain  brings huge promise  including efficiency. But what sanity is there in rushing to judgement  Human interaction  on the political level  on the institutional level  on the personal level is marked by tremendous complexity that is irreducible beyond a certain point. The quick execution of statute as determined by a smart application might reduce pecuniary costs  and speed up the settlement of dispute  but it robs the interested parties of their right to a full investigation of the merits of their case in the eyes of a legal structure whose proliferation of parts  and ponderous inefficiency  elaborate proceedings  and tremendously pedantic priesthood is intended to turn its wheels so slowly that its chances of crushing the innocent and strengthening the powerful are reduced to the minimum possible.

 gt In 2018 Vyacheslav Polonski published  an article on the World Economic Forum  https   www.weforum.org agenda 2018 11 algorithms court criminals jail time fair   on the problems ensuing from predictive analysis showing how defendants are being sentenced to longer prison terms because opaque algorithms predicted that they had statistically significant chances of recidivism. So the sentence was determined not by the crimes you have committed but on an algorithm s determination of your chances of carrying out a future crime. And this despite the legal principle of nulla poena sine culpa  no penalty with the crime . This is appalling.

 gt  Judge Noel L. Hillman expresses deep misgivings  https   www.americanbar.org groups judicial publications judges journal 2019 winter the use artificial intelligence gauging risk recidivism   about all this but there are other considerations. Human behaviour is irreducibly complex beyond a certain point  especially as environments and circumstances change. It is therefore impossible for the legislator and adjudicator to act pre emptively. Consequently putting the legislative and legal processes into the hands of emerging technologies to increase efficiency will lead to swift decisions taken automatically on the basis of historic data  and not on established law and proven guilt.This is an act of utter evil and tyranny  and a violation of another vital principle of Roman law   Nullum crimen sine lege  no crime without a law   specifically no crime without a previous law  a written law  a well defined law  and a precise law.

 gt Ultimately it comes down to costs. The engineer is right to seek to lower the costs of his products. But the point of our Roman based system of law is an equitable outcome for all men. If you seek efficiency to cut costs in legislation and arbitration  you might save coin  but you will pay the far higher price of injustice  tyranny and blood.

 gt There is a sense in which I do not blame the engineer. For him  inefficiency raises costs  and hinders his work. But it is still deplorable that he has so little understanding of his fundamental methodologies  quantification and falsification  that he seeks to apply the values of his trade to the irreducible complexities of human behaviour  especially in politics and law. But the lawyer who is embarrassed by accusations of inefficiency is more deplorable still. For that lawyer no longer understands the root  purpose and values of his profession  and has become more concerned with counting cost than with the fundamental principle of the law   which is human equity. Efficiency is no value in this domain. Leave machines out of politics and law. Let the practice of politics and law remain always the domain of mortal man.",

People still continued to party  they still let people cram into Walmart s without masks for like the first two months  and some wanted to go full militia because social distancing lockdowns apparently is on the same level as concentration camps.

If everybody cared enough to wear a mask and social distance  I m not just blaming right wingers  there s plenty of other people who didn t  despite the narrative that it was white right wingers who are the only ones who don t care and continue to spread COVID  we probably would ve been out of this mess in July at latest. Maybe.

I m very much against government mandates  I m anti mask mandates unless it s private companies saying  wear a mask . But I think the whole politicizing everything made things worse. This is when we fight back. Let us not stay at home simply because they tell us to. We go to work. We go to church. We go shopping. We live our lives.

But come on you guys   this is pure propaganda in regards to  socialism vs free market economy .  If you disagree with me  please explain to me how this poll question makes any sense at all.  Despite the increased calls for socialism by many on the far left  the vast majority of likely voters believe that the United States should embrace a free market economy. Only a sliver of likely voters think that the United States should abandon the free market capitalistic policies that are responsible for making the United States the wealthiest nation in world history. Despite the countless calls for more socialism among elites in media and Hollywood  Americans aren t interested in adopting the same socialist policies that have led to mass poverty wherever they have been tried. 

Wow  real unbiased polling right there. Oppose socialism all you want but that is 100  propaganda. Plus they don t give their methods or how many they polled. I suppose if we went to a Trump rally and picked 3 people waiving MAGA flags and asked them do you support President Trump of course they ll say yes  you can t go print  When asked 100  of Americans support Donald Trump  Wow  a bunch of people who aren t her constituency don t like AOC  weird.

So far  the subjects have been mostly compliant. Simple existence isn t enough. We aren t soviets. Lockdowns are the sledgehammer in the context of what tools there are for controlling a pandemic.

The goal ultimately involves saving lives but the practical aim of all pandemic control measures is to prevent medical services being overrun   which then affects non covid patient outcomes. The death rate is less than 3  but the hospitalisation rate averages at 20  globally  particularly high if too many people are infected at once.

Facemasks and social distancing  where practical  have worked to slow the spread but compliance determines their effectiveness. We ve also seen that harsher lockdowns while causing short term economic loss have led to better rebounds in the long term    providing confidence to businesses and customers  New Zealand is obviously best example .

What has been lacking from an American response is that if states insist on closures like other countries  then they also need to have the same support mechanisms  furlough  stimulus etc.  but also a measure of cooperation so individual efforts aren t undermined.

Hopefully the vaccine is effective but this is all important to consider for if when the next pandemic emerges. Bro  its a pandemic  just stay your dumbass inside till it slows down  why make this political  do you just not care about getting sick  Is your business more important than your life  Your parents life  Your kids life  Your friends life 

 amp  x200B 

The faster the pandemic slows down the quicker we can get to business as usually  going out and about is making it worse. And before you say something stupid like  99.999999  of the people with the virus survive   its not about surviving the virus  people with the virus take up a lot of resources in hospitals  if all the hospital resources are taken up by people with the virus  when there are accidents  or incidents that require hospitalization of someone  that person may end up dying because the hospitals nearby would be overbooked. Imagine getting into a Carcrash and then having to be driven two hours from where you are because every nearby hospital is full  and then getting Covid while in the hospital. Or going to a hospital and finding out all of the doctors are currently sick so there is no one available to help the patients",

t3_klbfhp,Your Schoolbooks Lied to You  What Happened After the Bolshevik Revolution,https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/klbfhp/your_schoolbooks_lied_to_you_what_happened_after/,"And OP takes the mask off.  Weimar Germany and Soviet Russia had a period of close military  cooperation during the 1920s  the Hitler Stalin Pact of 1939 marked the  beginning of the Second World War  and during the long Cold War  the  USSR had no more loyal a satellite than East Germany. Perhaps two dozen  years of hostility over the last three centuries  with good relations or  even outright alliance during most of the remainder  hardly suggested  that Russians and Germans were hereditary enemies. 

 

Moreover  throughout much of that period  Russia s ruling elite had  had a considerable Germanic tinge. Russia s legendary Catherine the  Great had been a German princess by birth  and over the centuries so  many Russian rulers had taken German wives that the later Czars of the  Romanov dynasty were usually more German than Russian. Russia itself had  a substantial but heavily assimilated German population  which was very  well represented in elite political circles  with German names being  quite common among government ministers and sometimes found among  important military commanders. Even a top leader of the Decembrist revolt of the early 19th century had had German ancestry but was a zealous Russian nationalist in his ideology.

Under the governance of this mixed Russian and German ruling class  the Russian Empire had steadily risen to become one of the world s foremost powers. Indeed  given its vast size  manpower  and resources  combined with one of the world s fastest economic growth rates and a natural increase in total population that was not far behind  a 1914 observer might have easily pegged it to soon dominate the European continent and perhaps even much of the world  just as Tocqueville had famously prophesized in the early decades of the 19th century.

A crucial underlying cause of the First World War was Britain s  belief that only a preventative war could forestall a rising Germany   but I suspect that an important secondary cause was the parallel German  notion that similar measures were necessary against a rising Russia.

Obviously  this entire landscape was totally transformed by the  Bolshevik Revolution of 1917  which swept the old order from power   massacring much of its leadership and forcing the remainder to flee   thereby ushering in the modern world era of ideological and  revolutionary regimes. I grew up during the final decades of the long  Cold War  when the Soviet Union stood as America s great international  adversary  so the history of that revolution and its aftermath always  fascinated me.

During college and graduate school I probably read at least one  hundred books in that general topic  devouring the brilliant works of  Solzhenistyn and Sholokhov  the thick historical volumes of mainstream  academic scholars such as Adam Ulam and Richard Pipes  as well as the  writings of leading Soviet dissidents such as Roy Medvedev  Andrei  Sakharov  and Andrei Amalrik. I was fascinated by the tragic story of  how Stalin outmaneuvered Trotsky and his other rivals  leading to the  massive purges of the 1930s as Stalin s growing paranoia produced such  gigantic loss of life. Uh huh. Sure. Napolean and Hitler had very close relations with Russia  that is true. lol.

It s not like they re sitting on an astronomical amount of wealth...oh wait Uh...what does the election fraud have to do with covid stimulus  I m sorry  but I m still among those who say only covid related things should be there. Meanwhile  we have one of our RHINO s stating   Romney Says  2K Checks Too Expensive  https   www.westernjournal.com despite handing 700 million sudan romney says bigger stimulus checks expensive cant just free money     .    

We need to take care of American s  and small medium size American businesses  not third world countries. What does  Democracy in X county  even mean  

Back in the W Bush and Obama days   democracy in Iraq and Afghanistan  really just meant  warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I really think the Biden Harris administration will be one of continuing random warfare. Good.    33billion to Venezuela for helping to steal our election Yes  They are more important than we the people. Stop lobbyists. Stop throwing money into the trash. Stop allowing money laundering. Stop helping the richest to hurt us. LOL Yes  do not certify votes from Ohio  Florida or Texas.  There was no paper trail and the fix was in  Amen brother or sister  It s the KICK BACKS FOR those nations going along with the COVID SCAMMMMMMMMM IMO",

Alongside actual calls for tyranny we could also list the numerous times Trump and others have referred to news reports as  fake news  and  hoaxes   but there is actually a serious argument here that you can t dismiss by saying it s on the  course  to tyranny.

For the science community and politicians familiar with their finding  arguing whether there is climate change is akin to debating other fundamental theories of science. The comparison with flat earth being that to accept that you have to ignore satellite technology and all space agencies  much as with climate change ecology  geology and now decades of study would have to be disregarded.

NASA shows the North Arctic ice literally depleting in 30 years.

The models show the point of no return is in 12 years to maintain this temperature and thankfully most people accept some form of climate change is happening  but it s taken years to get any sense of urgency or to capitalise on the potential growth from green tech.

Also excommunicate fake ass republicans from the party. The jeff flake types A famous Ron Paul quote 

 Foreign aid is taking money from poor people in a rich country  and then sending it to rich people in a poor country.   Someone s got to pay for that. 


Don t we pay taxes... aren t we that someone who is paying for that  This is amazing  why does the United States government hate it s own citizens. Every time he opens his mouth  I hate him more. Does Romney the outsourcerer have foreign bank accounts   Panama  Cayman  Swiss... And this is why this guy will never be president. He is only fiscally conservative when it comes to money going to Americans. It s our money Mitt  would rather it be going to Americans before foreign countries Trump s best legacy will be cutting off foreign aid. Making countries pay their fair share. Well then Congress can take a 100  Pay Cut until States stop locking down and then continue their pay cut for an additional 9 months. I don t like Mitt Romney  he s personally been responsible for destroying this country and has given  Capitalism a bad reputation to a lot of people  https   www.latimes.com archives la xpm 2007 dec 16 na mittbain16 story.html . He s an enemy to the American people. He s getting kickbacks from foreign countries through his kids. Another crook like Biden Ok i paid enough taxes this yeah for 30 americans to get 2000 dollar checks. Please use my taxes on that instead of on gender studies for pakistanis Here is one of the things we learned this year    foreign aid is not about helping foreign countries  it is about enriching the Congress and Senators who vote for the money.   I d bet the house that if we could truly  follow the money   we would find huge amounts of this  foreign aid  ending up coming back into the bank accounts of the criminals running our country via shell companies  board positions  charitable donations  etc...   Truly disgusting.   Instead of helping the people crushed by the  lockdown    that did not appear to have done a thing    these people line their own pockets.   So next time you hear  foreign aid   substitute with  personal enrichment .  That is why it is important to them. Dear Mittens 

who tf do you think you are telling us that OUR tax dollars should go to others before us  Utah   please get rid of the shithead. Just one of the many turds that needs flushing. Its soon time that the people stand up and make sure he gets flushed. Oh so now that his cronies aren t getting the money  he s worried about the deficit  Yeah Mitt  someone does have to pay for that foreign aid y all piss away every year. I paid  5000 in taxes last year and I only got  900 back. Give me my money back What a fucking two faced idiot But a 25k raise to Congress is ok   
14 more million for the stupid Lincoln Center is ok   
Millions to foreign countries is ok   Fuck him. We shouldn t be sending money to other nations during a fucking pandemic Romney needs to go. He s lost it again Wonder if he supports free college for all  After all  someone s got to pay for it. Wow  He thinks it s the Government s money. That s where these slime bags come from. Well it s the PEOPLE S hard earned tax dollars YOU MORON. I sincerely hope he s a 1 term Senator. This guy is a disgrace. Worse that John Kasich   and that s quite a feat too  So wait  RINO Romney is worried about spending on citizens  but still ok with funding other governments first  I never trusted Romney  and it speaks volumes that Biden isn t even in yet and he flips back to America last. Are you shitting me      We pay taxes  in my case for over 30 yrs  and he thinks this is free money for us. But what does he think millions to Egypt is for future toll payments for using Suez. Hate Trump  live Trump at least he operated from the point of view it was our money as the citizens of the US. I have been a Republican since 1988 and I took my first vote but there needs to be a sweeping replacement of all of them.       wtf ...expensive for who thats our money  gt    I paid over 4k in taxes it needs to stay here. Congress is cancer Here s an idea  let people work for their money. Fuck Romney the coward. Both sides are being stupid. If the bill is gonna be 900 billion dollars then we might as well give most of that to the american people instead of foreign aid. Trump was right in vetoing the bill. That s typical of neo socialism. Take from the tax payers and pay the non worthy and give nothing back to the tax payers. I live in Utah. Romney doesn t stand a chance when his re election occurs. He s a traitorous bastard. I hate the realization that I m related to the turncoat. Rand Paul makes a good point I will not vote for any Republican who votes against more for Americans. Whats more important  forgein nations or your own people  spoken like a true piece of shit that he is. Given how much of an ass hat he s turned into  I m depressed I voted for him in 2012... New Name Pierre should immediately cut all foreign aid  because the idea that the entity with a monopoly on violence can take money from its citizens and give it to foreigners is insulting and obscene. Romney is an absolute pos. This fucker is worth millions and this just proves he doesn t give a fuck about we the little ppl. Him and his rich friends were never affected by the economy and this just proves that he gives 2 shits about those that were. 

We the ppl better stand up and grab our fucking balls soon or we re destined to live a life of servitude to these rich powerful bastards. We need a fucking movement and we need some leadership for that movement. The kind of leadership that straddles both sides of the fence and sees and thinks beyond their fucking nose. 

Right or left we better start admitting to ourselves that we are ALL pawns in this game.  The democrats don t give a shit about the ppl that voted for them and the republicans don t give a shit about those that voted for them. Both sides constantly pander for the votes only to give us the big fuck you finger once they are in office  and this fucking bill is our proof. They know that the vast majority are against this bill and the appropriations of the money yet the do not care. If they cared what we thought they would look us in the eye and say you re right. They dont believe in Americans first  only what fattens their pockets and the pockets of the lobbyists and the companies they represent. 

I m about at the end of my rope with this shit. Everyone that has worked long and hard to achieve what they have or are working towards those same goals should be at the end of their ropes too. 

When the fuck are we gonna stand up against this shit  Or are we all just gonna lay down and become the submissive dogs they want us to be  

I may work like a dog but I am no fucking dog  and tired of being treated like a dog.  

 Government is like a baby. An alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other. 

    Ronald Reagan  

wow relatable. Dear Congress...quit spending money we don t have.  That foreign aid  money for the damn Kennedy Center  etc are bullshit.  Just stop  These politicians should be hearing the footsteps of the American people 24hrs a day. Stop giving money to savages and lowlife countries. Pierre Delecto has gotten rich off the backs of Americans  he is a disgrace. Why is this guy still around   All he does is create confusion. Don t forget the  4 million for each past President  Why  Unless of course you are a gender studies professor in Pakistan then you can have ten million  Can someone kick that RINO in the ass  You sucked as our governor of Massachusetts and now you fooled those poor people to be a US Senater. You suck and use the lords name in vine to lie to people. Today is the day that Republicans are worried about the deficit. Maybe Hunter the meth head and his dirty daddy Joe can foot the bill.  They re raking it in from foreign countries so they can afford it  I m sure. I wonder who that  someone  is  You didn t work shit bud. No body comes on the internet to say that. 

If you want to feel better about yourself at least lie in secret Either he has mental problems or he s corrupt AF. 27 Trillion dollars in debt and they are still lecturing us about our money... if I want  2000 of my tax money you are gonna give me  2000 of my tax money. They need to stop giving away this money to other countries and just spending it on garbage... We need a full audit of the government.. This elitist cult believer is partly correct. There s no such thing as free money. We will be paying for it for generations to come with our tax dollars. IMHO  the overreaction to COVID is bullshit. All this stimulus is so unnecessary. That said  if we re going to have it anyways  keep the fucking money in the  family.  This is why we should get rid of these wastes of brain power. It is interesting that both liberal streams and conservatives agree that 2000 is better. I wonder if the agreement is the same for who should get the checks and the unemployment benefit extensions. I m literally voting dem next election cycle if these fuckers don t do something about this. Goddamn politicians playing us all for complete fools. Seems like they only worry about someone paying for that when it s to fund social safety nets  m4a  or stimulus money to the ordinary citizens. But  Joel Osteen definitely needs  4.4 million What a tremendous bundle of sticks... The relief bill was paired with the annual government spending bill. The relief bill had 0 foreign spending. But I do agree that the government budget bill spent too much on other countries. Yes we can pay US citizens back their tax money.   I would like my tax money back now please.   You rich folks can send your cash to whatever country you choose   just give me my hard earned cash back now. Who keeps voting for this guy  He calls himself a republican because he knows that is who the people in his area want. Romney is not a republican or conservative or constitutionalist. Ummm he s right.   If we all get 2k we are destroying the buying power of the dollar.   It doesn t matter how much you want free money it s a REALLY REALLY BAD IDEA    Time magazine should start a stupid asshole of the year edition and plant Romney on the inaugural edition  Huh  he must know of a math I m not aware of....  2 checks would be less than half the pork and special interest spending  legislates millions of dollars of tax cuts for millionaires and corporations 
 wE cAnT jUsT hAvE fReE mOnEy  Unpopular opinion  we are incentivizing SOME Americans to keep spending money on things they don t need.  Foreign aid should of course be limited to life and death medical or maintaining police security during this pandemic.  But it doesn t change the fact that some Americans are being paid more to stay home than they made at the job.  The last  1 200 checks disproportionately went to Amazon and Wal Mart for diversions to occupy the extra free time.  In my opinion  unemployment should have been pegged to your last few years W 2 forms and the  1 200 only to those who made less than  50 000 taxable income on 2019  2018  and 2017 tax returns.  The precedent we are setting right now is going to bring Jimmy Carter era inflation which will hurt the working poor driving 20 year old cars the worst. So Republicans continue to fuck everyone again

This guy is SUCH a weapons grade douche bag. How would that work  I thought Twitter users got to decide who they follow. Not that I know much about Twitter. An actual time I agree with Twitter. What a pathetic Douchebag      Wasn t it enough he took Trump s votes. Read the article this one links to. I don t really care who gets the followers. But trump inherited Obama s followers so there is precedent for them to be mad at. But still this is kinda petty. I m surprised Twitter isn t forcing everyone to follow him instead. I do think it s weird that they re doing this now but not when trump took office and got to keep the original Twitter followers along with growing it further. I don t really care though. Do you  Isn t it trumps personal account I remember hearing people complaining that he wouldn t use the potus account Biden is not even involved in this article  since nobody bothered to read it.

Weren t the liberals the ones who claim Epstein was killed by trumps henchmen   removed  I try not to butt in and mostly just watch  I mean this is a conservative sub and I m not conservative  but comon  there are plenty of people that think Epstein didn t kill himself  probably because he didn t  and that joe biden won  because he did even though everyone hated him   removed  WTF is wrong with potatos    Why would anybody compare China Joe to a potato    Potatoes are great.  China Joe   Not so much. Honestly  I don t think ANYONE is under the impression that Epstein didn t kill himself. Biden didn t get 80 million votes.  Not Trump  got 80 million votes. I find this insulting and demeaning to potatoes everywhere. The conspiracy that Epstein was killed to hide Bill Clinton s history was widely spread by conservatives  despite Trump being in far more pictures with the man .

The thing is  you need evidence in order to go to audits. Signature audits aren t effective because signatures change so much based on various circumstances. It doesn t mean they re fraudulent. You also don t spend millions on investigating a conspiracy theory that evidence hasn t supported. If there s evidence of fraud  the courts would be dying to see it  especially all of these Republican judges. Do you honestly think every judge is just out to get Trump and part of some conspiracy theory  That s insane.

Good luck with the coup  but the corruption of the Republican Party has just gotten out of control.

Not a liberal  not a loyal democrat  just sensible.


Edit 

Can t fact check the below posts because I was banned for making this post.

Now receiving personal attacks from a mod on this sub. If you want a bubble where only people with the same opinion have  free speech  ...that isn t actually free speech. Debate means discussion with people who hold different views. The president literally just pardoned people who lied on his behalf. This is an outrage no matter your views. Law and order does matter  it can t only matter when it comes to liberals.  deleted  Don t disrespect potatoes like that. And Biden is also a pedo So true You do understand that 80 million people didn t so much as vote for Biden as against Trump  right  This isn t really a case of red vs blue or liberal vs conservative as a majority of voters understanding that Trump is a crude  cruel man unqualifed for his office. I personally know 3 people who voted for Trump in 2016  but against him this time  and one guy in his 60s who never voted before  but registered this time just to vote against Trump. Jeez ... get over it  he lost. Are you saying he can count to potato 

1 potato  2 potato  3 potato...   I m just mentally preparing for four years of liberals drooling over the sorriest forms of pandering  some wild cringing and Democrat voters turning a blind eye to the mess they re almost certain to create.

4. Ballots  both real and made up  were counted

5. Then the same ballots were recounted.

Hmmmmm

Now how would an audit that checked to see if each ballot was matched to a voter Change things  Really  The exact same people  Every single one of them  Uh liberals never even said that  across the board everyone said epstein didn t kill himself.

As for the votes  we had an election  nobody had any substantial proof to show that would indicate the vote wasn t legit  the other subs were telling everyone here that everyone is in a bubble and not paying attention to actual sentiment against Trump. Every piece of data available told us Biden would win for a year before the actual election happened. Yeah  Truth and common sense are not in the Leftist Socialist lexicon   Groupthink and Censorship are their go to s.  Potato head is kind ole Joe to them.
