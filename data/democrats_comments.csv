t3_kvg3xu,Do I have to ,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/kvg3xu/do_i_have_to/,"Every time I look at Pence  he reminds me of Steve Carell.

Not  The Office  Steve Carell  the  Ron Burgundy  Steve Carell Remember  every GOP Senator at Trump s impeachment hearing refused to ask questions  even though Russia was heavily implicated in election interference and hacking. Every. Single. One. Especially after refusing to invoke the 25th. Dude s a spineless coward through and through. Deserves no sympathy. He would rather risk his life and his family losing their father and husband to an insurrectionist mob supporting his boss  than hold his boss accountable for anything. Trump isn t his boss.  The VP is an elected official whom Trump cannot fire. You know... there s a minuscule part of me that feels a bit sorry for Pence. The dude was a good lapdog to an abusive master that would make the suffering animals in ASPCA commercials look like well taken care of pets.

But then  all I have to do is remember that this asshole...and Cruz  and Hawley  and Graham  and McConnell have been pandering to the  Sociopath In Chief  for damn near five years....then my empathy fades quite a bit. Mother said I can stay home because I have the sniffles. Native Hoosier and I hate Pence Bosses be like  You re still coming to work right   This guy is such a pussy. Trump literally sent his Goobers after him and he won t do anything about it. He is definitely has battered spouse syndrome. Well  you know  you could like  fire your own boss using the 25th Amendment if you re so scared of him trying to kill you  instead of relying on the Dems to do it for you. Seriously. No other way to look at this. Fuck it at this point  I d leave with my life long secret service I shouldn t have sent this to my employees.. Ya know...Mike pence kind of looks like a real life woody doll but with wrinkles everywhere. Like his face is too perfect. Who would love to know what they discussed at their meeting last night  And Where is a legendary fly  Omg  ",
t3_kv4oca, Camp Auschwitz  guy identified ,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/kv4oca/camp_auschwitz_guy_identified/,"Trump thought the riot looked  low class  I wonder why  This is the shit they wear and then they go online and cry    How dare you call us Nazis   I bet he plays a mean air guitar. Not ASAP  wait until after the 20th. Knowing Trump  he ll pardon this monster. Dear white supremacists. If you are going represent my race as a supreme race. Please represent yourself of a supreme example to my race. Stop making us look bad you trashy PoS s. Get a job  donate your time and money to charities  get a solid education  take baths  be physically fit  control your fucking emotions. Todd Packer that s crazy I can smell that picture Lock the mother fucker up. He s a domestic terrorist. Such good people. The best. These people are shit stains on our society A felon.  Only the best     Why does every trump supporters look like the bottom of the barrel of human species May he rot in jail  at least for the next ten years.... Breaking News  tRump supporters are Anti Semitic  Film at 11  sorry for the non sequitur  but any word on the guys that dragged Officer Sicknick out and beat him  I m especially curious as to the whereabout about the guy who was beating him with the other end of the flagpole. Got another Antifa   s

I love the  Success   caption  it looks like a misplaced before and after for a hair product. Fuck that guy And this one of their movements leaders  It looks more like a bowel movement. Another one of Trump s  fine People . Sign me up for ALL the updates of terrorist arrests  Before sentencing I hope the judge tells him   Work will set you free . I m a liberal but respect conservatives and their ideals but republicans who are defending trump and his cronies are in terms  supporting this garbage of a human being whether they like it or not. The kind of mind and person that orange piece of shit attracts. there actually is something good about these riots if all the trump supporters get arrested. First  there probably will be less crumes  and on top of that  some republican voters wont be able to vote When the GOP sends they re people  they re not sending their best. They re sending criminals. Maybe we should build a wall around them. Hmmmm. Hahahaha  of course he s a felon. Another one of Trump s base. Trump sending his  very best  as usual.  gt hes been always extreme and very vocal

you don t say Taking back votes he can t cast to begin with Felon gonna felon.... It s nice to see all these people being reported  bit it also shows that these trumpers are incapable of creating their own society. Everything they do rides on the success on well mannered people that are appalled at their actions. This is also why they hide away in the mountains  cursing those that live in cities and anywhere you might learn to care about people that don t look and act like you.

Bounty claims are never a bad thing either though As a fellow virginian  I say fuck that guy He looks like he is used to prison. It won t be so bad for him. if incarcerated in the general population...he will be in trouble...the  girlfriend  kind of trouble Only the Best LOL It appears that in the past four years the REPUBLICAN PARTY has regressed in their membership. That doesn t look like the same person to me. I was hoping news reports would have more info but it seems a bit thin. We ll see how it goes over time but I remain skeptical. Is there someplace online where there s a gallery of images of people that was filmed in video pictures involved with the Capitol storming  This guy has a friend  Is he perhaps related to Todd Packer  also extreme and vocal  How does his phone have a cord   Why do all of these guys look so much better in these pictures than those taken at the capital  The guy who was stealing a podium cleaned up nicely. This guy looks like he got a long overdue beard trim.   


Why  My god. My pacifist extended family live in Newport News. These people are low class in their thoughts  or lack thereof   their RACIST and SEXIST OUTDATED ideologies and their ACTIONS. How they dress  in my opinion  is inconsequential. Donald Trump is LOW CLASS with a HIGH CLASS WARDROBE...just goes to show sometimes looks will be deceiving. A great MANY of our gullible citizens got fooled into voting for a FACIST DICTATOR because Donald Trump had money and clothes but neglected to look at his positions on policy or his absence of basic intelligence BTW  the back of his shirt says  Staff . How could someone like that think he s superior to ANYONE  The headdress guy s mom is asking that her son be let out so he can eat only all organic meals. Lol. Nutraloaf   Reasons I ve gotten off public transportation before my stop.  Trump s illegitimate son. These are the people who want  their  country back. When you re supposed to take the minivan but end up taking the Ferrari.  Very Fine People  A felon from Virginia. That is the least bit surprising. I  ve tried to talk to family and friends who Support Trump and the anti Democrats movement  I try to warn them that some of these home grown radical organizations are nothing but underground Nazis and Racist that have deep seeded terrorist ideology and that a lot of the disinformation and misinformation they are being fed on the internet and right wing news is being manipulated by them  they are slowly sucking them in and radicalizing them to thier cause and they don t even realize it. They are so addiment in their hatred toward Democrats and the Government and their belief in all of the conspiracies going around that I am afraid it s to late even bring them back to at least use their common sense Tom Araya went down a dark path after Slayer.  s",
t3_kvekkt,No Crawling Back   ,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/kvekkt/no_crawling_back/,I just love how AOC takes no prisoners. She lays it out and holds them accountable.

t3_kvfqwa,Use the 14th Amendment to ban Trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/kvfqwa/use_the_14th_amendment_to_ban_trump/,"Yep  what s more  Democrats got ahold of the Senate  House  and White House to impeach him. Republicans can t do anything about it. Yeah  At the very least. At the very least. You would think the Republicans would welcome Impeachment or something. If they can stop him from running again then they can get the party back to what it was pre dumpster. They say he does not represent the party. Well now is your chance. Clear and present danger. Stop him. He said to come to the event  it will be wild  the name of the event was Wild and then he told these people to heat to the Capitol and fight. Hero or Zero s is what is son said. This  the 25th amendment  or the talk about impeachment could be everything we need to get trump out of office  and put a bad mark on his record. Hey  so I put together 8 simple tips in case this whole thing blows up. I m sharing it around to hopefully inform people who may not know how to prepare for an event like this  though most of these can be useful in other emergencies  from active shooters to hurricanes. Stay safe. Survive. 

1. Stop  forget everything you know about preping  its not crazy to prepare for the worst  and it s not expensive. Breathe  calm down and think about things  what will you do  Where will you go  Are you friends with your neighbors  Do you have somewhere safe to go  Do you need to bring someone home so they are safe  Do you have dog food 

Plan. Write it down  discuss it with your family. Survive.


2. Food. Food is hard  but it doesn t have to be. 

Think about how much food you ll need to stay fed  do the math for your family and pets.

Most people think of prepers as people who have a basement stocked with food  but in reality you can prepare for an emergency by buying an extra case of beans  or getting a couple flats of ramen. Ramen is especially good  because everyone has a favorite flavor  it s easy to make  and it is enjoyed in everyday life.  It is also cheap.

Some Ramen comes in a cup  so you don t even need a pot. 
Ramen is also shelf stable and can last literal years.
And finally  Ramen is light and can be carried fairly easily.


Camping food  college food  survival food. Ramen.

You also want to pick up dried meats  some canned beans  not a whole lot  but try to have a month s supply at least. Don t go overboard here. 

Oh also  buy a multivitamin   you ll probably be losing a significant chunk of nutrition  and maybe some fiber too. Keep yourself regular. 


3. Water  we can survive 3 weeks without food but only 3 days without water. If you go to Walmart you will find these little iodine tablets for  7  10 or a life straw water filter for  14. 

Failing that  you can boil water and filter it through a coffee filter filled with sand to get out the grit. Also  toilet tanks are potable too  providing you are not using in tank bowl cleaners. 
 
Water treatment plants  power plants  and other forms of infrastructure are prime targets for attack.  So be sure to think about this.


4. Knowledge.  

Your mind is more powerful than anything else   it is our second greatest strength.

My dad was a good man who wanted to care for his family when the towers fell   so he ordered a 5 year food kit  he talked all about how if the terrorists came  he would take care of us. Then we got the box of supplies  it was massive  and had cereal grains  dry beans  honey  seeds  sugar  rice....


My parents did not know a single recipe that could be made using only ingredients from our five year kit.

Do not buy something you don t know how to use  learn before you have to figure it out. Dont be like my dad  a loving man who forgot one of the most important steps. Learn before you do. 

Rest in peace you glorious bastard  you took yourself out too soon. You missed one hell of a fucking show.0


5. Love.

When humanity brought into being from the forges of evolution  we were faced with a world that did not care  creatures that could crush us without a second thought   predators that outmatched us in every single way except for two.

We are smart.

We are social.

Humanity is one of the most social creatures on this planet  our ability to work together has brought us from using rocks and sticks to cars and guns. 

You are not going through a situation alone  there are people out there who will cooperate  so make some friends  deepen your friendships  and remember to budget a little extra  so you can feed a weary traveler or provide help for your fellow man.

When humanity brings forth the darkest demons  it also brings out the brightest heros.

Love eachother  even in the face of adversity.  

You will get through this.


6. Defense.

Being realistic  you ll probably not have to worry. The national guard and police will deal with most if not all of the actual violence if a civil war starts. 

Knowing that  here s what I will tell you.

Don t go insane

Don t buy a gun if you don t have one.

Instead of going out and getting a shotgun  instead get a short bar  a tire iron or just a 2 ft piece of rebar  and some nice flashlights. 

The odds are you would  again in the worst of worst cases  be required to defend your home  so learn how to set up an ambush  lure them in  and then take them out. The real nutcases have body armor  so instead aim for the joints  genitals  throat  face  and limbs. A hard strike with a piece of metal will be enough to severely injure someone  and those areas are often overlooked by the people who are crazy enough to buy body armor.

Also  if you know how to use a gun. Most body armor is rated up to a .308 

So hunting rifles  large bore revolvers  12 ga slugs  and some crossbows can still pierce it.

Body armor comes in 3 forms.

Steel.

Ceramic. 

Composite

Steel is the best  a solid plate that can take multiple shots  stab resistant   and also hurts like a motherfucker when hit. It is also the heaviest choice.

Ceramic is your second choice  it is wonderful at stopping rounds  it is light and it actually doesn t hurt too too much when it takes a shot. It is also stab resistant. 

Downside is that it can only take one or two shots.

Though Realistically that s all you would need if you are the intended user  a police officer or soldier. 

Third is composite. It is lighter  sometimes more durable.than Ceramic   and can sometimes take multiple hits without breaking your ribs. Sometimes it is stab resistant   sometimes it isn t. 

Now  if you are dealing with a maniac wearing body armor remember one thing.  

Fucking run. Retreat  get out of their way and let the professionals take care of it.


If you must fight  stay calm. You are going to be ok. Grab a weapon  chair legs  curtain rods  kitchen knives  pipes.... you want a short stick that is about a foot long.

Bait them into an ambush and then get low or high. People expect threats to come from head height  not the ground or above. Aim for the previously mentioned areas  and then pulverize them. Then once they have been injured or immobilized  run.  


If dealing with multiple people  either focus on escape or cooperate. Do not try to outgun them  out think them.


If you have a ranged weapon that the armor is rated for  stay calm and aim for the previously mentioned areas or try to hit the same area repeatedly.  Body armor is designed to catch stray rounds  out think your opponent and aim. Make your shot count.


And if you have a bow. Well I m not saying that a bow should be used in this sort of situation   buuuuut most composite armor is designed to stop a light bullet moving really fast  not a relatively slow and heavy arrow with a sharp tip. Also  most carbon arrows explode hilariously well when they hit a hard surface like Ceramic or steel. I m not telling you to use a bow in combat  but  if you aim for the chest with a carbon arrow  there is a 1 3 chance it will puncture the armor  and a 2 3 chance it will hit the armor and fucking detonate into razor sharp shards of carbon fibers. 

Again  I m not pushing you to be violent  just sharing information about what they may have and what you can reasonably expect to be up against. 

7. The bathroom. 

Toilet paper will probably be the first to go  but buying some extra TP won t hurt   also just get an extra tube of toothpaste and maybe refill that prescription a little earlier. Talk to your doctor about maybe letting you get a 30 day supply of extras. 

 Maybe also top off your birth control and buy some... protection 

8. Morale.


You are a survivor   you are going to make it. So take care of your mental health.

Your pets  they are so much more valuable than you realize   they are part of the family too  and that means they cannot be left out. 

You need love the same way you need food and water  so be sure to let yourself relax  hug someone  kiss your spouse  and help where you can. 

You are a survivor. Do not forget that. Above everything else you have to remember that. You will survive. 

So hug on eachother   hold on tight and never let go.


Also take time to watch a movie  play a game  work a puzzle  read a book. 

You will survive.


I m sorry this went long  it kinda got out of control   ill be sharing this around  and I know it is probably too much  but I want people to prepare for the worst but hope for the best.


We fight today to have a better world tomorrow.


You are a survivor.  You will pull through",

Now it s biting you in the face 

Well  shucks. Typical Republicans  it only becomes important when it affects them as individuals. Sad  but they wont learn anything from this   theyre all thinking  Maybe I can get the people all worked up about ME next time and I ll be the despotic leader they try to kill for  I feel no sympathy but if it s effective in keeping Republicans complicit that s not a good thing for anyone. Play stupid games  win stupid prizes. Republicans created and exploited this monster for their own ambitions. They get about as much sympathy from me as the arsonist who gets burned by his own fire. This is domestic terrorism. There is no other way to describe it. Cowards so cowardly that they re willing to go full Benedict Arnold. r leopardsatemyface Frankenstein  ooops Yeah  bad news  they already tried once and probably will again. Your story sounds familiar to me. There once was a guy named Dr. Frankenstein who created a monster to destroy his enemies. The monster did destroy his enemies and then turned on him. But you re perfectly happy for those same terrorists threaten the duly elected outgoing Vice President  and the new incoming President.

Sniveling coward. I think they thought they were only going to go after democrats  which they were content with.

Where were the GOP leaders when Trump supporters attacked on Biden s campaign bus  Trump called them patriots.

So  now that they can sense that GOP leaders are also at risk  they are finally showing some concerns. Remember when that Trump supporter at the Capitol said  We pay taxes  thus is our house.   I guarantee he pays no tax and siphons off the government. Just like Trump. Face  meet Leopard.",

t3_kvkgtt,Most of the arrests from the Capitol riots have been misdemeanor curfew violations. This searchable table shows everyone charged so far.,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/kvkgtt/most_of_the_arrests_from_the_capitol_riots_have/,"They need to start applying the Murder Felony Rule. Prosecute all of those domestic terrorists for the murder of the police officer. Send them to prison for 20 years. No more attacks on the Capital. Problem solved. Why were they allowed to leave the building  

They should have been arrested then and there  and given a bail later.

Imagine if these were BLM protesters  I doubt they d be allowed to go home without being arrested first. More charges can be tacked on later.  This is just to get the ball rolling.  I would also expect to see them being offered deals such as take ten years for sedition or we can go to court on a murder charge.",

She is a terrorist. Change my mind. There s no such thing as  facing calls for arrest.  Just because some people are asking for her to be arrested doesn t mean a hill of beans. Getting tired of these clickbait posts. Unless a judge or a grand jury or a police agency or a district attorney has actually issued an arrest warrant   there is no  facing  anything here. I ve seen nothing that showed her live tweeting Pelosi s location. I ve seen one tweet saying that she has left  but that notably did  not  include anything about where she went.

This shit has plenty of evil attached to it. Adding false or misleading accusations will serve only to hurt the cause of justice here.",

t3_kuzm3s,QAnon congresswoman faces calls for arrest after live tweeting Nancy Pelosi s location to rioters,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/kuzm3s/qanon_congresswoman_faces_calls_for_arrest_after/,"Lock   
Her   
Up They are unbelievable to think they would get away with this. This is sick. Why this is not a reason for arresting her immediately is beyond me. I seems like the people  that tweet shit like this  don t know that what you post is public record. And this livetracking could hav killed someone.

Edit  in brackets  Seems like baring her from congress should be on today s agenda. This Colorado Rep. has a lot I mean a lot of hate in her to do any good. No normal person can approach a lectern and be so animated with this amount of hatred. Get rid of her and closely keep an eye on her cafe in Rifle  CO. WHY WON T ANTIFA QUIT HACKING INTO PATRIOTS PHONES AND MAKING BODYSUITS THAT LOOK EXACTLY LIKE US IN ORDER TO DO VIOLENCE TO MAKE US ALL LOOK BAD

 s she seems to have a pattern of doing dumb things Are there tweets missing  The two that seem to be the biggest issue  we re locked in the chamber  and  the speaker has been removed  aren t incriminating or giving anything away that isn t public knowledge. I don t see anything beyond those where she seems to be live tweeting Pelosi s location  I was watching ABC news and they were sharing the same info. It s also quite obvious protocol that the line of succession would be removed and protected.

 We re locked in the chamber.   Pence has been removed from the chamber.  isn t any different. 

There are still plenty of other reasons for this awful person to be removed  but I m having a hard time with  she was live tweeting Nancy Pelosi s location  based on the tweets in any of these articles. What a stupid  useless twat of a person Disgusting  whats wrong with these people What do you think would ve happened if they found her  Yeah  arrest. Also for the love of God remove her. This is insane. Can felons legally carry Glocks  See   They re inside Government. Well this explains how they found her office  according to Washington insiders her office is not easy to find. What is going through these peoples minds  hey this is a good idea to do  I don t understand their logic LOCK HER UP  LOCK HER UP  LOCK HER UP  I am ashamed to have her in my state. She s toast.  All of those terrorists should be immediately detained until cleared of charges. LOCK HER UP  Well I mean  look at the tweets.

1  We are locked in the house chambers.

2  The speaker has been removed from the house chambers.

You can interpret those tweets as trying to inform the mob about the location of the speaker  you can also interpret them as trying to save her own skin or you can interpret them as just reporting on events. 

It s important to point out  they don t actually reveal the location of the speaker  just where congress generally is in the first  and where the speaker isn t in the second.  

I mean  I d be okay with her getting a charge for the things she did inciting the riot  but it s not clear to me that these tweets really did anything harmful  and I m pretty sure we have no case to prove that. I don t like Nancy Pelosi  but this is beyond sickening. Soon to be former gun owner   Why is this not being talked about in the news     I tried to see if there was something else to this story aside from the two tweets that have been made public. Honestly as much as I think this woman is a disgusting human being and honestly doesn t deserve to be a member of Congress  I can t imagine her getting convicted in a court of law or impeached over the two tweets that are made. So embarrassing that she s from my home state  removed  After 9 11 our country stood together to mourn  to rebuild and to get pissed at a common enemy. We demanded justice. Yes Bush fucked that up but our country cared about each other.  Where s that today   Our common enemy are extremists lead by a maniac. 300 000 senseless deaths.  Hundreds of thousands more starving  unemployed  risking their lives for minimum wage.  We re worse off today because of what he was too arrogant to do.. what a leader should have done.  But expecting a person who has never lost  who s never been without food or shelter  to actually understand us is never going to work.  We die everyday while he watches TV and doesn t care about us. Her video on the floor of the chamber makes me want to slap her silly. She s the one that wants to bring her Glock to work every day. How do you guys think this is attempted murder lol. Bit of a stretch She did not commit a crime. How are people calling for this 

Name her crime. I just dare anybody to pull up the law that she broke.

Y all we are swinging wayyyyy too far left and into the outrage culture. wtf. can we get the death penalty for her ",
t3_kv48ks,Nancy Pelosi on Twitter  The person who is running the Executive Branch of our government is deranged  unhinged  and dangerous.,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/kv48ks/nancy_pelosi_on_twitter_the_person_who_is_running/,"Get  em Nancy  it s clear that the VP and cabinet are not going to move forward with 25A He betrayed America completely. There needs to be some kind of emergency response that enables congress to remove a sitting President immediately in the event he or she commits crimes like this one did on Wednesday. The fact that he is still in office five days later is appalling  reckless  and scary. 

Relying on A VP to invoke the 25th is inadequate because the two were elected together. The Congress  and or the Supreme Court  with a simple majority  should have the power to invoke the 25th just as well as the VP  because our government is composed of three coequal branches. And one branch should be able to stop any other branch in an emergency  even if only short term  so an investigation can take place. 

Also  I understand that if a person commits a felony  and during the commission of that felony  a person dies  they can and should be held responsible and charged with manslaughter  if not murder. I hope republicans never win another election after this.

And lead these terrorist idiots to his back up officers.  We need to honor him   Not all hero s wear capes. Isn t this the Blue Lives Matter Law  amp  Order crowd  Chasing  assaulting and killing cops all in one day  This man risked his life  bless. Ability to make critical decisions on the spot. Goodman is good man 

Sorry I had too He is the only real American in that damn room.    

I hate to do this to him but seriously zoom into his eyes and see the raw emotion in them. He was  understandably  fucking scared but he was brave and he served lady liberty well and I hope he is proud of himself. We are sorry you were left out to dry but we are thankful for your bravery it is a candle in the dark


Edit  AND he s still got his mask on  I wonder if he is a gamer  because this is textbook using  aggro  to  kite. 

Either way  great job  Can we get a thank you fund going for this dude  Chances are  he s going to be targeted... and if nothing else  it can ease some financial stress since police salaries are not gigantic. I m over scheduled and don t have time to research how to even do a fund for someone else. Make   him   police   chief   This dude is a fucking BEAST.

Saved countless senators lifes. A true hero who gives honor to the uniform and badge  When i first saw this video I was angry at him because it looked to me like he had opened the door and was leading the crowd in. It was not apparent to me that he was actually misleading them. Brilliant  and brave. Once again  it is Black people who have saved American Democracy         this man is a god damn hero. He s a Good Man Medal of Freedom for this guy  but from a real president. It s all in the name. Great man the police we need  I d feel better if his mask covered his nose.  But maybe he did that to get the morons to trust him. That dude must have ice water in his veins. There were so many cops who defended the capitol  4 of them died to it. We don t hate the police  we just hate the ones who are biased  but these officers were not biased  thank you officers  This is the video I first saw of it  he played it cool.    


 https   twitter.com igorbobic status 1346911809274478594 s 20 This man deserves the highest honor for service and courage that can be bestowed. Biden must preemptively award it. Don t know if that can be done.....Thank you Officer Goodman. You are a hero. Give that man two promotions  And a raise  I hope Biden appoints him to a position in police reform and gives him a presidential medal of freedom. This is amazing. True hero. 

But it is also extremely fucked up that we are in a state in which a black man has to act like bait to get radical racists to go after him like zombies  so that they don t kill senators that won t back a coup by Trump. This man is nothing short of a hero. He saved lives while risking his own. There are a lot of noble police officers out there. That s why we need to fund the police better  so we can have better training and more great police officers. So he should get the Medal of Honnor. H.E.R.O is the only way to describe him.   Eugene Goodman should get a big raise and a commendation   .    Make it happen    Hero I wish he was wearing his mask right  although with all those spit drooling domestic terrorists around it might be futile. Who who is he He should have shot people. acab Just one dumb question   how or why is his batoon  behind  him on the ground.   Is it protocol  Think what you want but if he was a police office he should have held his position and used his weapon Is this the one who wagged his stick at them while retreating up the stairs  Seriously ",

Will it come to us needing to defend the capitols against these crazy people  To assist the police against terrorists  Armed protests sound like more insurrection. I m not just taking about democrats either  us and republicans who view this whole thing as ridiculous which there are many. The many outweigh the conspiracy nuts of trumps cult. More trump inspired terrorism  we need a military presence at these locations  this is getting out of control. 

Also  could you imagine the response if BLM protestors brought guns to their protests  Military needs some target practice I think Trump is looking for an excuse to invoke the Insurrection Act  and his violent base knows this. If the states call in federal armed troops  it puts him one step closer to invoking it and retaining power  preventing Joe Biden from being inaugurated and becoming President.

He is refusing to resign because he is waiting for the civil unrest to become violent enough to give him sufficient public optics invoke it.

It doesn t matter to him that these people are his own base. He has them under his spell. That s why they were screaming about the Insurrection Act last Wednesday.

The soup is still on the burner  and we are in the pot getting cooked  unless our elected officials can act quickly enough to get him out of there.

Don t think it can t happen. Never believe Trump won t go that far. If I ve learned anything else these last four years  I believe Trump will go that far  and farther. We need a new hashtag to rep unity against this.  left amp rightVsTrump or  LeftRightagainstTrump And when gun rights are further restricted the Republicans can thank the far right extremists for that.

America is so fucking skewed. Spoiler  he s a piece of shit doomed to a terrible legacy No matter what....he s still a POS doomed to his terrible legacy. He s always a piece of shit doomed to a terrible legacy. At best this would reduce the perception of his active role as a Trump enabler  but there is nothing he can do to remove the stain he s been on this country. He won t be a hero for pouring a cup of water on the arson fire of a situation he helped create. i dont know about hero...dude has a pretty sketchy past  but he could prevent violent insurrection save what is left of the republican party from being torn apart by calling for impeachment and charges against all those who helped bring this ugliness about.

 gt 
 gt The U.S. and Congress  have faced down much greater threats than the unhinged crowd we saw today   McConnell said.  We ve never been deterred before and will be not deterred today. They tried to disrupt our democracy. They failed. This failed insurrection only underscores how crucial this task is for our republic.   

McConnell needs to back up his words of condemnation with action  by holding the instigator accountable.  It s his duty to do this  crucial task   and only he holds the power to see that it s done.

Otherwise  he is worse than a coward.  He is a nothing  a non entity mouthing words to no purpose whatsoever.  In fact  he will be responsible for and complicit in WHATEVER Trump does in the future  if McConnell does not make it impossible for Trump to make another run for our highest office. Mitch McConnell  could  be a decent person and care about the citizens he serves  but he won t.

You could have said this anytime in the past 30 years and been correct. He was a terrible person who spent his life in pursuit of power  intent on leaving a legacy of evil.  Leveraging racism  chauvinistic nationalism  and greed to motivate others to his cause  he let loose dispare and death on his countrymen.  In his wake he left the soul of his nation bleeding.  In the end he was a hero. Hitler shot himself. He s not going to do that. The articles of impeachment will likely be brought by Monday Tuesday of next week. But the senate is on recess and only doing pro forma sessions. All 100 senators would have to agree to do ANYTHING other than the pro forma sessions  including impeachment. So essentially between now and the 20th  there very likely will not be a senate trial. The earliest would probably be the 19th.

From what s been explained to me and from.what I ve gathered  nothing will come of the impeachment until the 21st. The goal there from what I understand is to then strip him of any benefit he may have received from.beimg president as well as bar him from ever running for political office. I m betting POS What people like McConnell and Graham are learning is that the monster they helped create can turn on them in an instant.  They were fine with being hated by the Left  but now they re hated by the Trump Right too.  

Sadly  I think a lot of other Republicans are going to see the example of what happens when you dare stand up against even the worst Trump actions  and they re going to just keeping towing the line. 

EDIT   For anyone who hasn t seen   here s Graham feeling the wrath  https   www.cnn.com videos us 2021 01 09 trump supporters heckle senator lindsey graham orig dp.cnn video playlists this week in politics   McConnell is a mass murdering sociopath who is deeply compromised by China and Russia. Don t hold your breath. McConnell is a human you can describe categorically as evil. Jesus christ can we stop trying to rehab the oppsoition party    It s the second one. McConnell s response   Ribbit.  Mitch McConnell will never be a hero Moscow Mitch   Mitch McConnell did his best to coddle Trump and block an investigation of the Russian interference. He helped fan the flames of insurrection. He made the first responders from Sept11  beg  for their approved benefits. Unforgivable. He looks like he s about to bite the head off a fairy. Slim chances of him doing the right thing. Nah  the turtlefucker will always be a villain. He ll always be a PoS doomed to a terrible legacy  but that legacy could have a silver lining. Don t get your hopes up. Self reflection isn t in the conservative kit.   Hero    

No  he would be doing the bare fucking minimum that s required of him. Why the fucking shithell is this sub still pretending that mcconnell and the gop will ever do the right thing 

What the fuck is wrong with you people  There is no version of this story where Mitch McConnell is anything remotely close to being a hero. Mitch doesn t care My money is on   he s a piece of shit doomed with a terrible legacy Otherwise  Are you trying to make the blood of a rock boil  Or are you trying to appeal the democratic hidden deep inside him  You must be young  but for sure he will do smtg to dissociate. Hmmmm based on the fact that he packed the court and disobeyed the constitution  I don t think he s going to do the right thing No. Absolutely not. He will   never   be a  Hero  in even the most charitable use of the word.

After decades of social political economic damage to America with compound interest rates  the obvious profiteering of Trump s Authoritarian Nazi esqe rhetoric  disgusting lack of morals and integrity  and exemplar display of  Everything that is Wrong with America . 

Mitch McConnell will only ever be a   Villain    a   Scourge    a   Reprehensible Human   that will go down in history as a co conspirator to a failed  violent  mentally unstable and misguided Mob of Insurrectionist Terrorist. Spurned on by him and his Political and Financial allies to push   Authoritarian      Class ist      White Supremacist Nationalist   agendas solely to reap evermore excessive financial gains off the back and from the blood of disenfranchised and oppressed  undesirables  in the mist of a global pandemic that only spotlighted and exposed the gaps ingrained deep within a system he and his allies   created      exploited   and   further widened   in years leading up to this very moment in time.   He is a piece of shit doomed to his terrible legacy.   

He s already said he wouldn t start the trial until one hour after the inauguration. That means he wouldn t start the trial  since he will no longer be the majority leader 1 hour after the inauguration. Then be targeted by MAGA for the rest of his life  Idts    Fuck that noise. Nothing he could do now or in the future will ever  EVER  erase his record of scum fuckery. That s a LOL...Mitch McConnel expel members of his own party for their behavior   That s rich   Really  really rich   Ummm no. A good deed now doesn t make up for his years of obstruction  lies and fear mongering. What about  italydidit  Nah bruh. Even If he does this he s no hero. He s just less of a asshole. Nope  he supported the actions that led up to this he s just as complicit. Can t decide at the tail end your not okay with it No he will not be a hero but be a shameful politician  and embarrassment who enabled Trump all the way up until this point. by doing the right thing the most he can accomplish is saving face and then he should resign. What s the point of a post like this 

Don t speculate on a world where Lucy isn t going to pull the football away right before you try to kick it  you don t live there and you never will. Since Moscow Mitch identifies with being a piece of shit doomed to his terrible legacy  he ll probably be going with option 2. But he is a piece of shit doomed to his terrible legacy. He s definitely resigned himself to being a piece of shit. Spoiler alert  he is a piece of shit He s still a piece of shit either way Believe this  

If Moscow Mitchell McConnell is going to be the hero 

We re already completely and totally fucked   MOSCOW MITCH AND TRUMP   NAME WILL FOREVER BE IN CHAIN TOGETHER IN HISTORY  Dont expect anything of him or pence. Even though both would have likely been killed  they have not spines. Gobble gobble ain t gonna do shit https   i.imgur.com F37Ekzm.jpg Mitch McConnell is a piece of shit. He just has a chance to do one thing right before his already shitty record goes down in history. I ll take piece of shit for  600  Alex. Surprise  He s a piece of shit. No matter what  he is a piece of shit. That s what his legacy will be.

You don t know how proud he is at all his actions. Don t expect him to have a soul now. McConnell is a pice of shit and a turn coat Republican. Dudes like 70 or 80 years old. He s locked into being a piece of shit. Please stop treating him like a person. This is a bad take. He ll never be a hero. But he might salvage a shred of integrity from the sewers. My guess is he will opt for the latter.   So he s a piece of shit doomed to his terrible legacy. Got it. I ll make it easy for you.  MITCH MCCONNELL IS A PIECE OF SHIT WHO CARES NOTHING ABOUT HIS LEGACY.  Why do you think his wife resigned after over 20 years   Mitch can t pass policies that make them rich anymore. Look at that turtle He already is looking for ways to reject the articles of impeachment. So yes  he is a complete human piece of shit. To put it short  he does not care  the existence of majority and minority leaders is so they can tank.  So they can be the ones to lead and make major party decisions so most of the hate falls on their shoulders and the rest of the party is shielded  mostly  from scrutiny.  This is why these individuals rarely run for president  they end up carrying so much political baggage to be electable.  I d be willing to bet that he loves his legacy of killing legislation  as it was his anti prigressive agenda.  Also by not letting it go to the floor these Republicans can just virtue signal to keep favor with constituents.    I d love to vote for it but mitch won t let it go to the floor  ooooh no . SPOILER ALERT He is already a hero to the people pushing the insane  Trump is Jesus  narrative. He will continue what is working for him... pwning the libs. Stop assuming there is anything human left in him. You really think Mitch Mcconnell cares about his legacy  Everything he does is a political calculation. He would eat a newborn baby on the Senate floor to retain power. Doing your job isn t heroic. Nobody praises the garbage man for taking the trash to the dump. Because that isn t heroic. It s the minimum. I m sorry  but it really doesn t matter what Mitch does here. He will never be a hero. He is a piece of shit.  Wouldn t even give Americans  2000 of their own taxpayer money.  People should be stormin the Capitol about that  seems far fetched No matter what mcconnell does at this point  he will never be the hero. He s been the most obstructionist pos for the last 10 years. He can burn in hell alongside trump  amp  his supporters Bitch McConnell is no goddamn hero  nor does he deserve to be one.

He s a treasonous thieving hypocritical grab asstic piece of amphibian shit.  Fuck him with an anchor. Hahahaha we all know Bitch McConnel won t do that He can do that and that might be the right thing. But he s irredeemable. You can t say you were just  pulling over after the high speed chase you led police on ends in a crash. Hell no. Republicans are trying to save themselves in the hopes everyone forgets how complicit they were Spoiler  He is a piece of shit doomed to his terrible legacy  well said . He is vile. Nothing he does can redeem his past actions. There is no way he will ever be the hero of the story  not after Amy Coney Barrett. Groundhog day...... McConnell is a piece of trash  Ope he is a piece of shit. I can t wait to shit on his grave. Even if he cures the world of hunger and stops all wars  this pos will never be a hero. I  for one  am gonna come down clearly on the POS side if we re putting it to a vote No  he doesn t get redemption. He can make good choices now and we can appreciate them for what they are  but he doesn t get to have anything but a legacy as a traitorous  self serving piece of trash who was too spineless to do his job until the ship we was on was sinking. Normal Republicans do not want Trump to have the ability to run in 2024. Because of this they might actually remove him or impeach him after he s out. He is unredeemable. Never a hero. SO pretty much the last part than..... We have a saying in Italy to respond to such outlandish scenarios   if my grandmother had wheels  she d be a wheelbarrow . Not gonna happen Mitch McTurtle doing the right thing   Where is the Bender  let me laugh harder  meme when you need it  That will be the day Lindsey Graham comes out. He won t. He s a piece of shit. Spoiler alert  he IS a piece of shit and is doomed to his terrible legacy that he deserves Come on McConnell  The force calls to you. Don t give in to hate  Could Schumer expel them in 10 days   deleted  It s going to be the latter.  He didn t    Narrator His legacy is secure. 3 supreme court justices in 3 years. PACK THE BENCH This is hoping republicans have spines that help the country  not their pockets. It seems like the lesson that dems will never learn is that if your plan banks on Moscow Mitch or Repubs doing the right thing  your plan will fail. He is a dishonorable man who works in a gov system based on the honor code.  Heroes of high profile convenient moments only  https   i.pinimg.com originals 36 f6 86 36f686fb9b110bd5c8daa9b6b6aa725d.jpg  I disagree. He will always be a piece of shit for the the myriad of other stuff he s done enabled before and during Trump s term. Impeachment would be nice but not redemption..at least not to me. Pretty sure he doesn t care I am guessing the latter. Sad. Yeah I don t have my hopes up on this one. At this point I ll be wildly surprised if anyone is held accountable  at least hopefully until the new DOJ admin is in. And pence isn t pressed 25th Amendment  as predicted. Man  they going down the worst politician with 45 the President of USA. Well  don t hold your breath. He doesn t care about hero status or what his constituents think.  He has proved this time after time Nothing in my eyes would make this fucker a hero...please..one good deed does not forgive all his past sins....hes not catholic..it dont work that way  s

This guy has condone and looked the other way for years. Nothing he can do will ever forgive him on how bad hes damaged our democracy.

Remember he been a proud supporter of the confederacy his entire life He s a piece of shit no matter what    Which path will he choose   The suspense is killing me    Not   His true character was revealed a long time ago. Gee I wonder which way this will go.... Folks need to realize you gotta be savvy. History and time will come around to fuck this dude in the ass. If this is what we gotta say to get in his head to make this move I m all for it. We can always backstab him later as he s done time and time again. I m not holding my breath though. Wanna guess which way he ll go 

You ve had years of hints. he will always be a piece of shit I don t think he could ever be a hero.  One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a life time of wickedness  Doomed. Don t try and start this narrative for him. This would not make him a hero never use that word and Mitch McConnell in the same sentence. 
r MitchisaLich What about a joint presser with him and Speaker Pelosi  Well all know Mitch will do the wrong thing.. I hate this man more than Donald Trump. I think we all know exactly what he will do. Wishful thinking. McTurtle doesn t have a heroic bone in his body. Especially when it comes to something that goes against his narrow self interest. The thing is  despite everything that s happened  the treasonous mob is still his base. He still needs their votes and he won t sacrifice that. In other words   It s turtle time  .... Don t ever put hero and him in the same sentence again..this guy is the devil in human skin Doomed piece of shit it is then  Biden ought to offer   if the Senate comes back and you remove Trump  I ll let the corporate tax cuts extend for one more year.",

Yvette Herrell NM should have never been elected in the first place. She scammed half a million dollars when she was a state legislature. That bad wig sits on the head of a second rate con artist. That is the whitest picture I ve ever seen Sadly one of these assholes won my district by like 200 votes. And that asshole is Mike Garcia People have had reports that sole had their families were being threatened. Still  if they had spoken out against Trump s conspiracy theory during the election  the big lie would have been extinguished and they wouldn t have been in danger in the first place. Why aren t they being charged as complicit  This is on them. They stoked and charged and poked an irritated bear. They catterwauled long and loud about a stolen election. They amplified trumps rhetoric to an angry base. These republicans helped the momentum  helped stoke the anger  and did so without fear of repercussions. Know why  
They ve watched this last year devolve into lawlessness  all of the people that just skipped impeachment trials  just straight up obstructed. Straight ignored subpoenas and went about their merry day. And what happened  Nan. Nothing. Just some finger wagging. Know what happens if I get a subpoena and just ignore it  A warrant for my arrest. But republicans get a pass for all of the damage they ve caused this country  FUCK. THAT. 
If these politicians are not held accountable for their complicity then a precedent is being set and it will be very hard to ever go back from that. This is not a third world country. This is America. We are letting the Republican Party create their own Al Qaeda that will just off the competition. The republicans listed here are terrorists plain and simple. They should be treated as such. 
And this is all bc the liberals let a black man be president twice. That s how deep the hatred and racism run. It s disgusting.

But the Confederate flag represents an enemy state that was defeated following an insurrection and war against the United States. As a state  it no longer exists. Anyone carrying it may be inferred to be in favor of slavery and insurrection. I wish it were a British flag. That is one trashy group.  I wonder if he was one of the guys who beat the cop to death    Hmmmmm.could be.. If this were an ISIS flag  do we hate the British   is it 1814  Maybe back in 1776  but nowadays  I think people would ve just been confused.

But seeing the Confederate flag in those halls broke my heart. It is the flag of literal traitors and racists  If it were a Russian flag he would have gotten a personal invite to go golfing with President Dumpster on the taxpayer s dime. If someone walked through Congress with a British flag... people would probably just be confused  

Do people hate the UK out by you  Where re you from  I think a better question is  if he was Muslim and carrying an ISIS flag  how would he be treated. Well that s a false equivalent.   
The British are our  allies .  
This is way worse. Imagine if it were a Chinese flag Honestly  I wouldn t mind the British flag as much  now. It s not.

The man in this picture is a piece of shit. Shouldn t there be just a ban on confederate flags  SLAVERY. James Raynor said it best at the end of the sixth mission of the first campaign in the original Starcraft   you slimy Confederate piece of sh   Imagine how Lincoln would feel about this  what an absolute disgrace. It s always amazed me that so many people who claim to be patriots also proudly fly the flag of treason instead of the flag of the United States. The feds are looking for this guy  did they identify and arrest him yet  It s the flag of Treason and should be burned wherever it s found. Those who fly should ostracized. The current British Flag wasn t adopted until America broke off.  Plus Since after the Civil War the Brits really were not enemies of ours we have a common interest.",

How fucking stupid are they really   Please tell me the FBI is on notice  Prison for the Qunt  Anyone know exactly what she was saying  I want to see the tweets How detailed were her tweets  I ve only seen one story about this so far  and all it had was a tweet saying  Speaker Pelosi has left the House chamber. 

Did she tweet anything more specific than that  Like her location after they took her off the House floor  Because THAT would be aiding these attackers. Simply saying the agents took her to a secure location isn t much of a tip. I m not a security expert  and even I know they d evacuate the Speaker early in a situation like that. The fact that there is anyone who believes in QAnon  much less members of Congress  makes me physically ill. She definitely should loose her job. Get her out of there like yesterday already. And bring a lot of capital police since she put up a commercial of herself strapping a gun to her waist and bragging about how she is going to wear it everyday as she heads towards the capital.  Clearly she thinks legislation is done by recreating shootout at the OK corral.  It s legal for them to carry but she was clearly implying other stuff that s not legal or helpful in governing. 

She could have gotten people killed with this stunt.  So irresponsible and reckless. Report her to the FBI. For the sake of the officers who died during all of this she definitely needs to be arrested. What she did is bad. Not as bad as the wording of the article title sounds.

If that sounds like healing  you guys are in for a treat. If you are a sane person  then get ready for literal hell on earth if you are republican.

If they don t want impeachment then every single Senator and House member that objected to Biden s confirmation must be removed from congress. 

 amp  x200B 

In fact  both should happen anyway. Democrats need a shock and awe campaign against GOP traitors. Trump Pride People Died.

Democrats and Republicans must unite to recognize that they are not Trumpism. Squash the wicked Trump and let Democrats Republicans heal and move past this  as Trump ideals should be kept separate from the two.

Otherwise  the battle between Democrat vs. Republican will continue. It s not a tit for tat thing  it is about breaking laws and the constitution. It ll divide the GOP  which is technically part of the country. The R party is banking on the civility of the Dems. Cruz spouted shit about  not dividing the country  while he literally challenged the results AFTER the insurrection. Somebody needs to punch that cunt in the throat. As much as I fucking hate what seems to be the modern Republicans  they make up 60 percent of my state and 80 percent of my neighborhood and office.  I used to be one.  I d like to be one again some day.    

Until then   Politically  ignore them.  Vote against them.  Don t try to win them over.   They will violate every one of their  standards  morals  beliefs  etc  for power.  

Fuck them 

But if asked  I ll nod my head and smile at the bullshit they spread. And vote Democrat till this version of republicanism dies. GOP is a bunch of liars and con men. The Damage is done. As one Mr. Bruce Almighty would say   b e a utiful 

I m disheartened it took this event to show me that the poison will continue within my party  but am delighted it s making me leave and never look back. Ah yes but to use Cruz s words against him  at least 50  of the country wants to impeach him so you have to do it to represent those voices who would otherwise be disenfranchised Conservatives  how dare you further divide the country after we specifically brought it to the breaking point ourselves  How irresponsible of you It s can t be business as usual. This isn t a forgive n forget moment. S   if I were president I d ask my Attorney General Garland to prosecute each n every one of you useless SOB s that objected to the electoral count. To casually propose as the republicans are that the country needs to move on is correct as long as it s into a courtroom or prison. All you objectors enabled this tyrant from the senior members to the freshmen in your party. To think that our military is putting their lives on the line for your type is heartbreaking. RESIGN the whole lot of you  Republicans are traitors     The concern about what the country thought was nil at Bush v Gore  very narrow margin  very fishy circumstances. We treat cancer by either removing the tumor or killing the cancer cells.  Then the healing can begin.  This is no different.  

Furthermore...the country is already divided.  They did that starting with Obama years. If it would actually further divide the country  trump and his loyalists would support impeachment The thing is that impeach Trump it s a necessity and a matter of urgency. He s dangerous and we need to be 110  sure his political life is OVER. 

Please   Trump NEVER EVER AGAIN  If we aren t going to HARSHLY punish an attempted coup  they will try again until they win. Do it as long as it doesn t take too long. Get it done while Trump s still pres so Biden can focus on Covid relief. Don t even bothwr with the Senate trial If we do not prosecute to the absolute limits of the law  and all GOP do not support completely  we will not put this behind us.
Trump and many GOP have said   this is not over   why would we think it is 
How can our nation heal if we are not secure in our political safety  physical safety  financial safety 
The GOP must step up actively or they are continuing to be enablers. This is always the way it is with Republicans  don t divide the country  don t blow up the deficit  don t be disrespectful  but only when they aren t in charge. I believe we have already discovered the Lowest Common Denominator in this fraction. As such  the Democrats have carte blanche to ensure healthcare  education and a livable wage and planet for all its citizens. RepubliQan Party has fully embraced delusional conspiracy theories that do nothing but divide us. We cannot repair or heal as a nation without first having remedy  like impeachment  prosecution  removal  restitution from Trump and his agents They divide the country and when republicans are held accountable they all of a sudden care about unity  Whew. The mental gymnastics that Trump supporters go through in order to avoid accountability. These people invaded a government building in droves  attacked Capitol police  smeared their own shit on the walls  defaced and vandalized the building  broke windows  and rummaged through secure documents. Some of them brought zip ties to take Congresspeople hostage  some of them were armed  they planted bombs  brought Molotov cocktails... they literally planned the abduction and public execution of elected officials on Parler days before the insurrection  and erected a goddamn gallows  to do it with.  They attempted a fucking coup while flying Confederate and Nazi flags. And yet  accountability is  dividing the country    

Their manipulation mirrors and abusive relationship. They think they can be as destructive  harmful  and dangerous as they want  and we have to sit back and take it or else  we re  the aggressors. They are allowed to come to another state  spread COVID all over the place  murder people in cold blood and keep planning domestic terrorist attacks  and the onus still falls on the left to make peace and forgive unconditionally... otherwise  we  are in the wrong. Fuck that. Accountability is not aggression  anyone who agrees otherwise is a piece of shit. We must hold them accountable no matter how much they want to deflect  project  and avoid personal responsibility. Their manipulation and dishonesty is truly appalling  but shouldn t surprise anyone  as they ve been this way for years. You cannot heal before you disinfect the wound. I literally hate the GOP. How do these assholes sleep at night  They have zero credibility and shouldn t have a voice politically at this point. Biden said this not republicans

People will be voting on their wallets in 2 years  dems have to deliver before then. Challenging is constitutional The country is already divided.

Everyone here supporting the same politicians that voted for the patriot act smh. Hypocrisy knows no shame. Republicans will say and do anything that will advance their cynical  hypocritical  cruel  racist and stupid agenda without regard for truth  reason  logic or consistency. This makes their  philosophy   totally liberated from accountability. Have a nice day  friend. Hell no  he better get impeached. Anybody else would be going to jail for a long time. I find it hilarious all the bastard GOP ers are now calling for time of healing  Sure a day after your asses are in PRISON But the rules they talk about don t apply to them. To be a conservative requires a belief that you belong to a group that the law protects but does not bind  and that there are groups that the law binds but does not protect. 

If there s a backlash to going too hard after people who tried to overturn an election with a violent coup  then it was already too late. Fuck the GOP The Greatest Generation had the right idea about what do to fascists....Fuck the GOP and what they ve created  everything the Greatest Generation fought for going down the drain.  removed  I fear a large swath of Democrats will assume that all Republicans think the same.

At least Trump will probably keel over from a stroke or heart attack within the next decade. It s not over.  They re gonna re group  amp  do something even more deadly.  Next time it ll be worse. That s why this impeachment is important even though he s out of office in a week. All of those in Congress who aided and abetted this sedition will be made to pay  and that s what Democrats should be working on from now until those folks  next election. This past election was a fight for our democracy  as will be the next one. The reason why Trump pushed the envelope further and further is because he was never adequately checked. We can t let that happen with these folks. Not to say that Trump should be treated leniently  but I doubt we ll have to worry about him coming back to power in 10 years. He should be in one of those assisted living centers they call  prison.   Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it. 


Winston Churchill Trumps fast food eating ass will be dead in 10 years but I agree with the sentiment. He needs to be jailed. I completely agree. They let the south off way too easy after the civil war and its coming to bite us in the ass. It has to be addressed for exactly what it is.  An armed attempt to overthrow a newly elected president by the reigning president by attempting to hold hostage Congress and the Senate at gunpoint  with firebombs  and with pipebombs.

It was an active armed coup attempt that failed due to evacuation of elected officals  capitol police shooting someone attempting to stop evacuation  and poor planning on the part of the insurrectionists.

You look at  conservative or  republican and watch how they justify their actions and downplay their goals.  This will happen again  again  and again if not  fully  prosecuted for what it truly is. I couldn t agree more as for others stating about this politician or that one or why Gremany was screwed don t mean a thing. Got to keep pressure on the enemies of our Democracy Yeah  the attempted coup that happened back then was very similar to this one.  We need to be careful within the next few years.  Especially in regards to the police are ready to install a nazi ruler. Exactly. Did anyone not watch his last speech when he was like  this is only the beginning  at the very end. Like excuse me bitch   The problem is Donnie isn t made out of bionic parts like Larry King or the Queen  he won t last another decade. Dems can t get complacent now that Trump is on his way out or capturing the WH Senate. The succeeding far right politicians candidates will be smarter  more competent  and will cause greater harm than Trump attempted. Dems will have to be more vigilant combating far right extremism and rebrand policies that appeal to a wider base that tend to be vilified by the GOP politicians like Medicare for all. And this is why Biden is worrying me. All he is talking about is Unity and Healing  and her ally ignoring this. I am for unity and healing but you can t heal until after the cancer is removed Oh  relax  Adolf  amp  the boys were just kicking back  amp  having some brews in that beer hall.  s Adolf was 34 in 1923.  Trump will be 84 in ten years. Thank God he isn t like fifty and still has 30 years to haunt us. Democrats need to call on Biden   Garland to name Preet as a special prosecutor to investigate this sedition  republicans role in it  the election tampering and the entire Trump administration. Well the good news is Trump probably won t even remember his own name in 10 years. Dementia is a bitch. Pence must become president for his own protection. His family needs the security services provided to a president  not VP. He and his family will always be targets for QAnon. Becoming President fixes a lot of problems. President Pence can pass the baton to Biden. Remove Trump ASAP  He should be in jail. Can you imagine Trump over 80 running and winning office

Traitors They got a bit closer than 92 miles.   
 https   en.wikipedia.org wiki Battle  of  Fort  Stevens  https   en.wikipedia.org wiki Battle of Fort Stevens 

Fort Stevens  about 5 miles due north of the White House  is inside Washington  DC city limits  though prior to the 1871 consolidation it was outside the city proper. 

Following the Union defeat at Bull Run Manassas the U.S. built a series of forts ringing DC  one of which was Ft. Stevens.  Most of them today are city parks in outlying parts of the present day city.   

Confederate forces under Jubal Early attacked Ft. Stevens in July 1864 but were pushed back into nearby Silver Spring  MD. Some accounts have President Lincoln himself observing some of the fighting. It would have been hard for the Confederacy to attack the city even if Early had prevailed.    


I ve reached the conclusion that the country has to fight the people who never got over the Confederacy in the 21st Century because we made a lot of mistakes in the 19th and 20th. 

Heck  in the course of looking up stuff to make sure I was posting something accurate  I discovered just how much stuff in Virginia is named for Jubal Early  who was a major force in the early development of Lost Cause mythology post war and is one of those men who by all rights should have been erased from any memorialization.

Former presidents are also given certain intelligence briefings on a regular basis  not as detailed as the PDB  that could be relatively sensitive.

That could be ended for him as well  and should. Small correction... he doesn t just lose his lifetime of Secret Service protection  he won t get to overcharge the government for lodging them in his shitty hotels and resorts It also sets a precedent that NO president is above the law. More importantly it forces the Republicans to go on record as either pro Trump or anti Trump.

For the GOP it s lose lose. They re base will devour them if they vote to impeach. But if they don t they ll lose the moderates.

It ll split the party  probably destroy it. Oh. I get it. So if he loses due to Biden winning election  he is considered former president and gets protection and healthcare.

But if he s impeached  it s like he got  fired.  so he doesn t get the benefits.

While Trump will lose either way  the impeach way makes us not waste taxpayer money on Mr. Orange Don t forget that all his travel and daily golf outings would be at Trump properties  so no more secret service means he can t make money off billing them for hotel stays or anything else. Impeach him now Trump probably thinks 200k  is below the poverty line I m tired of talking about it. Let s fucking do it already. Get it goin Nancy He needs to be impeached by congress and also convicted AND removed by the senate for these things to happen.  Just impeachimg him again wont do those things I wonder if that applies if the Senate doesn t convict  or lets be real McConnell isn t holding a trial . Stop talking about it and get it done. Im  NOW  PLEASE GOD  5  will face some form of consequence for what he brought onto America and the free world as a whole for what Wednesday means for the health of democracies around the world going forward. Impeached AND removed  right  He s already been impeached once and no one talked about these limitations back then. Doesnt lose rhe ability to run again unless its specifically put in the impeachment articles. Given he s such a huge fucking loser already  let s tack on some more L s to the orange wankmaggot.  4 Is a great motivation...

Of course it s worth it   also because sets precedence  no one is above the law  not even the President.... Why haven t they already fucking done it  The clock is ticking.....the longer we wait  the closer January 20 gets. Trump wants to just slip away into the shadows. IMPEACH HIM NOW. We should want him to run in 2024. He ll either loose again after people realise that he wasn t 4d chessing he was just incredibly dumb.

Or he ll split the vote with a new America first party. I don t mean to be a Debby Downer  but I just don t see how they will impeach him with only 11 days left in his term. I definitely think he SHOULD be impeached as he is dangerous  I just don t see it happening.     Will he also lose the aforementioned privileges if Pence were to implement the 25th amendment  ITMFA AGAIN let s see if they actually have the balls to follow through. YES please     he s gonna need that secret service detail. If he s impeached  Or impeached and removed  Does he get a Presidential Library   Cause you know he s gonna try to grift the hell out of that...that s his bread and butter... My family is all  oh it s only two weeks   It s fine    This is why we need him out 

Even Bernie doesn t want him impeached though... You ve convinced me. It s so worth it.  4 Might actually be attractive to some Republicans who wish to run in 2024. Does this mean impeach  which he has been already  or an actual removal which requires two thirds of the senate   Letting the Confederate leadership go without major consequences at the end of the civil war directly led to a over a century and counting of racial strife and neo confederate shenanigans  let s not make that mistake again. Totally. Just very unlikely IMO. That would be huge. I don t think enough people realize the endless grift o Rama in the offing as Trump drags his Secret Service detail to his properties for  1000 nt rooms   40 glasses of tap water  etc. etc. He doesn t loose his secret service detail. Any president that holds office has a secret service detail.  Considering who Trump has angered  he will have private security too  part of it is paid the government  Even Nixon had 2secret service details  before he died. Great  buts a fantasy. The Republicans need to cooperate to convict him. Sadly  that will probably not happen. I like  3. Why didn t he lose all these privileges when he was successfully impeached the first time  I am confused. Stopped reading at the   and its already worth. While they are at it  impeach the vice president  too. He knew what was going on behind the scenes and just stood by and let it happen. Impeach the Turd Even failing conviction by the senate  all of those can be accomplished by trying  convicting  and executing him for the treason he confessed to 3 years ago. Really  Holy shit we have to do this  This is the way Well let s get on with it already  there s only ten days left Sounds great but you will never get 16  republican senators to go with it.

It will just be another symbolic gesture. One the GOP will spin as Democrats shirking their duty to help Americans during a pandemic to pursue a vendetta. It s bullshit but people will buy it. He s already been impeached  so what makes this time different  Question  he was already impeached once before. So doesn t this already apply  Or is it only if he gets impeached a second time  Make it so. I can go land on his head if that will help I had no idea former president had a million dollar a year travel allowance. That is kind of nuts. Can someone fact check this  Hearing mixed replies about accuracy I don t understand. He already was impeached so shouldn t he have already lost all these privileges  Should the tweet say  impeach and remove   Won t happen b4 biden is elected We need to impeach this guy. He is a major liability to our National Security apparatus. I also like the idea that if trump attempts another coup or to drop a nuke or start a war  Senate can impeach him immediately. They can just vote to convict and it s over. Presidents haven t gotten lifetime secret service since Clinton.  He s the last one.  Going forward I think they only get 4y.  Well  I ve never commented on this  but the answer is no   Trump said.  I think I have to by law take  1  so I ll take  1 a year. But it s a    I don t even know what it is. 

Stahl reminded the president elect    That s   400 000 you re giving up.

There is no reason why the loser of an election should be allowed to take office. Ever. W was bad enough. The outrageous corruption of Trump should be more than enough to justify it.

Second  reinstate the Voting Rights Act and make voter roll purges a federal crime.

Third  De trumpify  amp  unpack the courts  make them reflect the communities they serve and not the RW fascist corporatocracy that the GOP represents. First and foremost  we have to insist that Trump and his acolytes  sycophants  and enablers be called what they are  anti democracy and  therefore  anti American. Then we have to support all legal efforts to get these people out of our government.       

If any of the folks who supported this sedition and insurrection are your senators or representatives  they need to hear from you  and you should be insisting they resign. Do not doubt what 20  30  or 50 thousand or more letters and phone calls can accomplish. If this small initial step is too much for you  don t expect to get anywhere with these people  don t say you re committed to righting this wrong  and don t expect more difficult things like changing the Constitution to happen if you can t be bothered to do this. We have to reach out to the groups that were instrumental in helping us bring him down. I m talking about the Lincoln project Steve Schmidt   Atlanta and Metro Atlanta Stacy Abrams Lucy McBath   BLM Alicia Garza   Bernie s crew  Squad AOC  and Republicans that advocated for Biden Kaisch . We all had this one homogeneous idea  get him the fuck out. So it only makes sense that we all should work together. If that happens anything like the past 4 years won t happen. Moving towards proportional representation and eliminating first past the post voting will go a long way to improve the quality of candidates. Less likely to be two parties as it diminishes the importance of the more extreme fringe views taking center stage. This is what I kept telling people. I have a feeling he would have tried to change the constitution so he could run again and again and again. Or change it so he could just be president forever and his son after him and so on. He s psychotic enough  he would have tried. He openly claimed he thought he would get a third term after winning the second because of  how unfairly iv been treated  of course he wouldn t have given up power hes Putins disciple. Ya ll may or may not know  or at least fully embrace this  but not all the right wing propaganda is organically grown. Oil companies pay  news organizations  to produce misinformation that will shift people to the right using anything that works. I have a family member that has established an impressive business doing exactly this  all funded by some fracking billionaires. 

Their goal is very clear and that is to continue producing fuel and plastic so that they may reap the financial profits for their shareholders. They don t get paid to protect our environment and they don t care that they are telling lies. 

Their influence is everywhere but most definitely in the heart of the republican party. Their lies earn them the votes of the people and their billions buy them the votes of politicians. If we  continue to treat these companies like they are not the enemy of the people then they will continue to fund domestic terrorism and misinformation. Without it they will wither and die. 

If we don t overcome their influence and by doing so overcome their misinformation machines  we will never shake this dog sh  t off our feet.

Our politicians won t save us. If the democratic party becomes powerful enough it will split into factions and half of those factions will be deep in the same pocketbook.

 If you buy a new car  it damn sure better be electric. Rid your life of single use plastics. It s actually not that hard especially when you consider what is at stake. Either be strong enough to take these steps or watch the world burn. This is what I keep telling people as well .. we were fucking so close to be permanently fucked by the GOP",

It s pretty clear that this is a race issue. If you are going to treat someone who is black one way  then treat the other person who is white the same way as well. Trump could have done this at the very least. 

If the guy on the left was black  we would have another George Floyd scenario.

Of course there s a difference....the man stealing the shoes is an opportunist and his motivation is material and he is not a terrorist.  The shoe thief is NOT a threat to our National Security. The shoe thief is NOT trying to INTERFERE with Election Confirmation and Transition. The shoe thief is not a member of a known violent extremist group  nor are his actions the actions of an extremist.   
The shoes are MINOR  likely covered by insurance  he didn t breach national security  and if it s his FIRST offense  it s likely a MISDEMEANOR.

Hilary Hanson
Angeli also wore red  white and blue face paint and carried a spear with the American flag attached as he roamed the Capitol. His many torso tattoos were also visible  including an old Norse runic symbol called the  valknut   or  knot of the slain   that has been appropriated by white supremacists.  Modern day Pagan groups have condemned the riots and as well as the misappropriation of their symbols by some groups. 

Angeli was among the supporters of outgoing President Donald Trump who broke into the Capitol to disrupt the joint congressional session that was formally certifying the results of the 2020 election  which Trump lost to Joe Biden.

The riot left at least five people dead  including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick  whom the mob beat over the head with a fire extinguisher  and Ashli Babbitt  whom police shot dead as she and others tried to breach the Speaker s Lobby through a smashed window. Three other people involved in the insurrection died due to what officials described as  medical emergencies. 

Capitol Police made only 15 arrests on Wednesday  despite hundreds of rioters breaching the U.S. Capitol  smashing windows  destroying property and forcing members of Congress to flee for their safety.

In the following days  more people have been arrested for their involvement. Along with Angeli s arrest on Saturday  the DOJ also announced the arrests of Florida man Adam Johnson  who was photographed taking House Speaker Nancy Pelosi s lectern  and West Virginia lawmaker Derrick Evans  who had livestreamed himself invading the Capitol.

Angeli  a supporter of the far right conspiracy theory QAnon  has become known for his distinctive choice of protest wear at rallies in Arizona  and his description of himself as a  shamanic practitioner  has led to his  Q Shaman  or  QAnon Shaman  nicknames.

t3_ktkic4,I m lost please read my comment if you can,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/ktkic4/im_lost_please_read_my_comment_if_you_can/,There is 1 comment but I can t see it. Wot I need advice and have no where else to go.. I recently moved back to my very very conservative home town in the south. My best friend since I was a kid lives here and him and I have always been two peas in a pod but I m more liberal and he s more conservative. We ve always said that it doesn t matter because our friendship wasn t built on politics and with recent events it s just shown more and more that we are really on opposite sides. After seeing my friend almost every day vs once every couple of months I realize he s a full on republican  there s absolutely nothing wrong with having different views but every time it comes up I don t say much because I try not to get too political in conversations because my views have always been different than others. My friend on the other hand has always posted controversial things  always very passionate about his opinions which I used to admire and I never say anything. But since the election he s constantly sending me links  telling me ALL the conspiracy theories regarding the current government and election  and especially after the events at the capital he says ignorant things  supports it 100  and now I realize he s obviously trying to change my mind. He sent me links to all of these conspiracies  we got into a argument because he believes the storming of the capital was NOT an act of domestic terrorism and I almost teared up because I realize to him  my BEST FRIEND IN THE ENTIRE WORLD who s been there with me through thick and thin has really never cared about my opinion. I have no idea how to confront this. I plan to move far away again and honestly I kind of want to cut them off when I do ... but for now I can t move and I don t know what to do I m so so lost please give me any advice you have             OP s Comment  ,

Better to stay vigilant. I think it s safe to say that this first attempt to seize power will not be the last attempt. Hitler didn t become the dictator of Germany by winning the first elections he attended to. The fascist movement grew with Hitler in the lead and eventually was voted in to power. And clearly there are plenty of people who are willing to vote fascist in to power. The threat of fascism is not over. There will be the next election  and the next and so forth.

t3_ksv8sp,Another reason why we need DC statehood,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/ksv8sp/another_reason_why_we_need_dc_statehood/,"Republican meltdown coming. Puerto Rico and DC state hood. Let s see them bumeush the capital when adults are in charge. So what happens when the state government is complicit in the coup  Yeah  we need Manchin to end the filibuster for this to be remotely possible  unless we make a nuclear option for something like statehood. I understand the benefits of statehood  but we could always grant the mayor of DC special privileges. No reason why those citizens should be at a defensive disadvantage during an emergency. Even if DC were to become a state  it wouldn t have changed this. DC becoming a state would essentially just shrink the federal district to just the Capitol  White House  and National Mall. Since this was literally at the Capitol  they wouldn t have had jurisdiction to go in. Getting rid of the federal district altogether would require a Constitutional Amendment  which is very unlikely to happen. Puerto Rico isn t a state  yet it has a governor and it has an Army National Guard force. Now  let me be clear  I m not arguing against DC statehood.  I m simply pointing out that it doesn t have to be a state to accomplish what your asking. DC statehood is on the block in 2021. With us controlling the senate and house  we ll be able to pass it and DC will become a state  effectively giving Democrats another Democratic senator too.  MakeDCTHE51ST In my opinion Supreme Court Justice kavanaugh is an illegitimate justice. I think we should find a way to remove him from the court. of course we can do this after we make DC and Puerto Rico states. Puerto Rico is practically a state right now anyway. YUP  DC should not be a state  if people want representation they should move.  However  the events of the 6th are upsetting and cause for concern. Who would have thought the people at the top of the govt. would not have the willingness to defend their capitol   I realize that the issue is more complex  and moving isn t always as simple as that.  I ve moved three times this year. 

Then there s the issues of state having power over the federal govt.",

You need stronger worker protections so that an employer cannot just fire people nilly willy without a good reason. And what people do in their spare time is normally not a valid reason.

The guy that wore an id exposing his employer and thus potentially causing them damage is probably not unreasonable  and in some special cases like a few government public jobs where you are supposed to behave politically neutral while holding that job or if your job is to be a company s public interface  then it might be reasonable to fire people if they break that particular job s inherent limitation of what they can do outside work hours. But in absolutely no way shall an employer have a say in what you can or cannot do in your own spare time in the general case.

Do you think it is fair for an employer to fire employees that 

  drives while drunk 
  drives over the speed limit 
  makes a racists comments to someone publicly 
  park on handicap spots without being handicapped 
  attend a BLM protest 
  attend an union rally 
  attend an anti abortion protest 

The answer to all those questions is no when it is done in their spare time.

By all means people should be punished by courts for the crimes they commit. But an employer is not a judge. Is it unfair that these rioters will have a tainted reputation that will make future employers less likely to want to hire them  No  absolutely not  an employer hiring people is free to judge the character of the person.

Same with Benghazi and Hillary Clinton s email. Both turned out to be bullshit  but there seems to be no negative consequence for bald face lies.

I hope this is the end of the Republican Party  but I am not optimistic. Nope... I ve been watching and listening for years about the  demise  of the Con Party.. they re just devolving into thugs and appear to be gaining support This is a cult  not a functioning political party.  They will have the support of 46  of the public for the rest of your life. not yet  let s see if this causes puerto rico and Dc to become states. Don t underestimate the short term memory and mental gymnastics of GOP voters. Fingers crossed. Short term political suicide  Yes  Long term  History says no. People thought the Republican Party was dead after George W Bush. That lasted about 1 2 years before the Tea Party re energized the party  leading to the election of Trump  and the rest is history. Don t kid yourself  the Nazis never had more than 30  of the seats in the Reichstag and look what came of it. The Republican base  supports  this attempted coup and has only become  more  virulently deranged. Over 100 Republican representatives still tried to derail the certification of the legitimate winner of the presidential election even as mob violence was taking place at their very doorstep. Learn from history. This will get worse. Its not the Republican Party its the Tea Party  Old school Republicans are trying to hang on for better days that aren t coming. You re too optimistic There will zero legal or electoral consequences for yesterday s events. Conservatism is not something we should continue to tolerate as a society.  Yesterday s events are all it was ever about  mediocre white people needing to hold onto power over others.

Fuck all conservatives.  They re  all  deeply immoral and reprehensible pieces of biological waste. They have been for 4 years sucking up to Trump and kissing his ass i doubt that.....it s more like the killer in silence of the lambs and his  transformation  With any luck they will go the way of the Whig party. 45  of GOP voters support the insurrection that occurred yesterday Give them time.  I think many party leaders have been humbled by what happened yesterday.  But their base hasn t changed one lick  and eventually the whole Party will come to support the rioters and embrace Trump even more tightly than before. We re seeing in the US what happened in russia. The GOP won t die and it will just get worse and worse because their propaganda works and there enough people who eat it up to support them. They will erode democracy until we no longer recognize the United States and their base will lick their boots while being wage slaves. They did that back in 2015. If this doesn t work can we abort the GOP  A bit post term  I know. They tried to make it a murder suicide. They are going out the way of the wig party. It was a slow death started by Reagan...now it s fully gone. Oh no....anyway  Like a poorly planned suicide attempt  where they just manage to really painfully mutilate themselves without actually causing death.. Except for the fact 40  of Republicans are ok with the insurrection. I don t know if they committed a political suicide but they absolutely committed a legal one. The so called Republican  Party  is now a terrorist organization which launches terrorist attacks against the federal government of the United States of America. We ve been saying this for 40 years. Maybe it s democrats who are by furrowing brows and nothing more who are. Not just elected ones but cowards like me who could stop it but don t. We said that when they elected trump in the primary.

When Biden wins  he did  a record amount of votes cast for him  his  supporters  will point and laugh at the ingrates and idiots who lost What s funny is that she is still tweeting nonsense  I guess nothing is ever to much for these types of people. Imagine being so stupid that you actually think a crowd of white men wearing stupid Trump shit is  Antifa . Some people are too dumb to live. Is she deliberately trying to fit herself into the stereotype ... Or can t she help it  White Isis.  Biden won. Warnock won. Ossoff won. Trump is going to jail where he should have been. And most people like you are making excuses for supporting him. Btw the cop his thugs beat up has died. Murderer. Yup. Tells me all I need to know . . . lol Tomi Lahren is Lucifer s bride  removed   removed  His supporters are professional rioters  Jesus christ I m tired of seeing this today.

Did we get this on all the subreddits  folks  I m sure there s a couple more places you can post it. Hurry  Free internet points await  I really doubt that Biden s supporters wouldn t protest either  but as a republican  I agree that storming the capital building was the most idiotic thing ever. Its so dumb to  rightfully  criticize democrats for fully supporting BLM riots where buildings were burning  but to pull this is just downright stupid. I really hate how trump was condoning this shit as well.",

late night when he need my vote  She essentially saved us from fascism. YAY  STACEY ABRAMS   

I made the biggest political contribution of my life to her organization  because I believe in her. As the Greatest of All Time said   There s not a man alive who can whup me. I m too fast. I m too smart. I m too pretty. I should be a postage stamp. That s the only way I ll ever get licked.  I see Stacy  I upvote. An amazing person.   I see Harris Abrams for President in 2024. God damn American hero Mos def As. Usual. Thank you   

Stacy Abrams bent Mitch McConnell over and whipped his ass.

She beat his ass  she beat his ass  she fucking beat his ass.

Others helped like Bernie pushing  2 000 Checks and Trump totally stabbing McConnell and GA republicans in the back.

We just lived through a epic drama right before our eyes. Mitch McConnell is shriveling right now.

McConnell  blocking all votes is 1000x worse than the filibuster. The filibuster  requires 41 senators to sustain while McConnell is only 1 person.

Adding  DC as a state will give Dems 2 senators  which is critically important  to maintaining a working majority the next 2 years. It will also give  moderate democrats cover for tough votes.

If  the courts are not fixed  the 6 3 republican majority on SCOTUS will  absolutely sabotage any Biden policies that they can. Breyer is not  getting any younger. Biden has not said he wont pack the courts.

Democrats  will only have a small time frame to accomplish DC statehood and then  push court packing. The big question is if they will get it done  if  they have the will to get it done.

If  they dont get it done  they will have squandered all the work Stacy  Abrams did and the democrat party will have yet again exposed itself as a  corporate controlled failed political party. Everything she s done for Americans is so beautiful
 Please remember  if you want to honor her find a way to get involved. This doesn t end today  it starts. Let s celebrate but then let s figure out how we keep this momentum rolling and show the world that we are the majority. She deserves the Medal of Freedom. American hero The devil works hard but Stacey Abrams works harder.  Give this woman the medal of freedom. She may have just saved our whole country. She needs to head the DNC.

I have to admit  when I didn t know much about her  I wasn t impressed with her. Turns out  once you see her on tv  and see what she can accomplish on the ground  you can t help but walk away impressed. Not to be dramatic but I would die for Stacey Abrams. I must now pray to her as well as AoC. Good time to be alive and see things change Hero  Synthwave Stacey Abrams She saved the country Hell yeah.  Put her in charge of more please  Get this woman a Presidential Medal of Freedom    She is a national treasure       Most significant person in the last 59 years If shes not the next head of the DNC then I m changing my registration. She s running for Governor in 2022  and I can t wait to campaign with her again. I had the immense pleasure of meeting her at a small event in my podunk Georgia town in 2018. She came out here because she cared. She cares not only for people who vote for her  but for everyone  and it shows. We had a meaningful conversation about my depression and lack of health insurance. There isn t a single politician that even comes close to having the amount of admiration I have for Stacey.  She is beyond a good politician  she is a beacon of hope for America. A truly good person  through and through. 

That s the direction Democratic leaders need to take  and also one of the reasons I was disappointed in both Ossoff s and Warnock s rural outreach. They didn t come here cause they knew they d lose here. That didn t stop Stacey. We need to leave that attitude behind if we are going to make sure Georgia  stays  blue. She needs a national spot. Get her running the DNC so she can translate her Georgia success for more states.   Time after time the progressives are putting in the hard work and getting the job done. 

Why doesn t the Democratic party elite seem to care  Mad respect for you  madam    Lol SA is the bomb but who decided the 80 s backdrop was the right choice here        A million percent yes. She is the real MVP. Hoping she gets a about from Ossoff Warnock She is way too good for this world She should be Georgia s next governor. Or DNC chair. Either one would be great. The next governor of Georgia Definitely inspired me  President 2028 Awesome person I hope she gets some important cabinet position in this administration. I would love to meet her  she is an amazing woman  Respect. She would be such a good DNC chair  But I think we have an obligation to support whatever she decides to do after all of the critiques levied at her over the past couple of years. Really hoping she can help flip NC soon. I shall now call her Momma Abrams. Vaporwave 

From now on  this lady should play a major role in rebuilding all Democrat election campaigns on a national level.  Let her pick all the top staff  educate them in what to do and how to do it.  
I mean... there s the Kaine Wasserman Schulz way of doing it  which is an incompetent  abject failure  and there s the Abrams way  which if you want to concentrate resources in this electoral college reality  should be taken at the very least to Florida  Ohio and Texas. Abrams for DNC Chair. Say it loud and clear. WE LOVE U SO MUCH          DNC Chair.  We need her. A hero of the republic        You know I had to do it to  em.   StaceyAbramsAmericanHero Agreed......... Give her the DNC already Mad props to this lady. Most uplifted I ve felt in a long time  waking up to these Georgia senate results. Stacy Abrams is a hero. Should make her DNC Chair. She deserves the Nobel Prize. The single person to have caused the most positive change in America in the last years.       Movie of the year...A Sista Scorned aka STACEY S REVENGE Queen  If the DNC has any sense  they ll have Stacey Abrams work with state level Dems across the country.  If this can be done in Georgia  who s to say this can t be done elsewhere  Abrams 2028 Yes she is and she should replace Tom Perez Democrats owe this Lady a huge  Thank You      Blue Neighbors and Stacy Abrams and organizations like them in Georgia have been fighting to turn the State Blue and now they ve succeeded  support these organizations  

https   youtu.be Fs eRvjwn 8 We are all the MVPs today. Never been more proud to be a Georgian. New south rise up Thanks Stacy. Thanks to you America is getting back into the batters box. I think most Georgians would be proud to call you Governor Abrams. DNC Chair     Thank you Stacy Abrams  This is a dope ass picture Can we put her in charge of vaccine distribution  I would love for Biden to offer her a position in his administration. I m sorry  who is she   removed  These people are fools. Say what you want to hear  and yet do nothing to solve the issues but throw words at it. To be clear  this is engaged fully in both parties. Dems do not have a lock in stupid. Why ever would one fix things that keep them in office  The real MVP is the person that keeps your trash picked up  the one that does all the dirty things to keep society running. Not elected politicians.Stacy Abrams is a cog in a great big grinder wheel that chews you up. Yes we know. This exact picture has been posted here like 3 times.  removed ",

Their goal is to destroy  democracy  to rob people of their rights  to rule unopposed. 

AN ATTACK ON ONE DEMOCRACY
IS AN ATTACK ON ALL DEMOCRACIES

It is our historic duty to those who came before us and gave their lives fighting tyrants for the right to vote  for the right govern  life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness  to fight against ANY and ALL attacks on democracies around the world. We can not and must not allow armed insurgencies  autocratic leaders and or domestic terrorists to gain even an inch of ground against the bulwark of the will of free people.

Let today  the 6th of January 2021  be the day we stood up against hate  violence and anti democratic ideology. Let it be the day that the enemies of democracy and liberty are finally known  named and combated with the full force of democracy and justice. Let it live in infamy  for today is a dark day  but let it also be the beginning of the end for the new forces of evil.

Let this be the day that every ordinary citizen stands up against the enemies of democracy.

They found a bomb at the capitol building  this is well beyond protesting or rioting  this is straight up treason as defined by Article III Section 3 of the United States Constitution. The entire GOP have declared war against the American people  and if we let them get away with it now  they ll do it in EVERY election from here on out.

Along with the GOP  Fox News  Newsmax  and OAN must be brought up on sedition charges. They have been stirring this pot for months  instead of telling their viewers the truth  they ve lied time and time again.

Trying to start a Civil War through blatant propaganda needs to be punishable.

This cannot be allowed to stand  we made the mistake of giving amnesty to the Confederacy before  and it was allowed to fester and putrefy within our nation culminating into a political party actively trying to destroy our nation instead of bending to the will of the American people.

Stimulus relief Covid and then corruption. 1. Universal Healthcare  There is a reason EVERY SINGLE FIRST WORLD COUNTRY HAS THIS 
2. TERM LIMTS FOR ALL FEDERAL POSITIONS
3. Ranked Choice Voting
4. Remove Cannabis from controlled substance list
5. Prison reform  Abolish for profit businesses  remove mandatory minimum sentences  create more user friendly pathways for expulsion and pardons  create actual rehabilitation programs such as education grants  etc
6. While we are talking about education  reform that  too. It doesn t all have to be free  but maybe make community colleges free  and maybe even some hyper employable 4 year degrees free  sorry English and Art majors 

If 1 and 2 are accomplished I will consider this a complete win. If 1 4 can be accomplished I ll consider it a dream come true. If all 6 are accomplished I ll be proud of my country again.

The only question is whether Ossoff can avoid a recount. We did it   Think of all the bills passed by the House that can now at least get a vote in the Senate   We may still have the filibuster to contend with  but getting 10 Republicans to vote for something is a helluva lot easier than waiting for McConnell.

  The race between Perdue and Ossoff is too close too call.

 gt  AJC.com  The race between Republican David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff is still too close to call. If Ossoff wins  Democrats will take control of the U.S. Senate.

Other organizations and individuals have called the race for Ossoff but none of the major networks or the AP have called the race yet.

The odds of legislation on criminal justice reform passing a filabuster in the Senate are low and their isn t enough support to handle the death penalty as a single issue.

The best thing that Democrats can do is govern responsibly from the center left. Overreach will limit this transient political dominance to two years  assuming the Senate projections are true .

Looking good    It s going to be a democratic win for both at this point it is who calls it first all the vote that is left is in democratic areas I was watching CNN and they made a great point.

Right now  the Democrats are leading. Because they counted Democratic areas first. When the presidential race was happening  Trump was leading  because they counted Republican areas first. 

During the presidential race  they counted all the ballots  including Democratic ballots which were counted last  and flipped the election to Biden. But Trump said this was  cheating .

So now  here we have Democrats that are leading. Should we be fair and continue to count all the ballots or go by Trumps standards and stop counting  Based on Trumps thinking  the Democrats WON. And if the election is flipped later tonight then it was fraud. 

So yay I kind of like Trumps philosophy now...Dems are in the lead first so they won   Show of hands  Who else is buying stock tomorrow while Republicans panic sell    URGENT

EXTREMELY URGENT  With the margins razor thin  Stacey Abrams has appeared in a new ad urging voters to check that their absentee ballot was counted. Voters have until Friday to fix problems

Pass it on. THAT MEANS REPOST. do not just upvote This may be stupid  but given how dire the threat of Climate Change is this race is making me think of a demo tune for Power Rangers RPM  they ended up using a different song for the theme .

 This is the last stand  for humanity   Power Ranger  RPM let s go  

I wonder if Ossoff and Warnock realize that the survival of our species may be up to them right now... So is this looking good or  Are the Dems definitely going to ditch the Senate filibuster  These wins mean nothing if the filibuster remains intact. So who runs the senate when it s 50 50  Who is the majority leader if there is no majority  Prediction  to avoid the controversy about Court Packing  Chief Justice Roberts or Justice Thomas will offer to just resign and give Biden a court pick. I swear to God  if we get the trifecta but don t do anything significant in the next two years  I m just going to vote Republican in 2022 and 2024. Just gonna watch the country burn.

My god  did a republican actually have the nerve the to utter those words  There has to be a much stronger word than hypocrisy to describe this. Is this country collapsing before our eyes  Idiot fascists guaranteed nationwide attention tonight. It would be perfectly justified to push back on this with violence. I m worried this might happen again with the Georgia U.S. Senate election. let s say that both Democrats win but it s close. Close enough for a recount. The Republican senators May refuse to recognize the Georgia senators until the recount is cleared up. Then throw out some false fraud accusations and they could just delay and delay  trying to stretch out the Republican Senate term as long as possible.  innate asses  It is very important to note   The PA State Constitution  https   www.legis.state.pa.us cfdocs legis LI consCheck.cfm txtType HTM amp ttl 00 amp div 0 amp chpt 2 amp sctn 9 amp subsctn 0   which supersedes Mason s Manual  the text PA Senate Republicans cited to justify removing Fetterman  only allows for a President pro tempore to be voted in if the Lieutenant Governor is absent or disabled  or if the office of Lieutenant Governor is vacant. There is no mechanism under the State Constitution that allows Senators to simply remove the Lieutenant Governor if they do not like the way he is running the Senate.

He cheated Stacy Abrams out of a victory  surely inciting her to dedicate the next few years to GA voter enrollment.

Stacy Abrams then delivered her ice cold revenge by flipping GA to Biden and triggering a runoff election that is looking to be a win for the Dems. So let s give it up to Brian Kemp  perhaps the person most responsible for GA turning blue  trump losing the White House  and the GOP losing the senate.

Jimmy Carter,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/kq9nxk/im_proud_that_in_my_four_years_in_the_white_house/,"The Carter years were some of the best years of my life.  If he freed those hostages he woulda been re elected. He was the first president I voted for  and I served 4 peaceful years in the military under him. Thank you Mr President. Carter was a better president than he gets credit for.  deleted  Most underrated president ever IMO. Stunningly beautiful human being Sometimes luck be a bitch and sometimes luck is a lady . It was lucky when Carter came into power but all the shit hit the fan  not his fault  during his term . If they could have rescued the people from Iran via helicopter he would have been a national hero and Reagan would never have won but unlucky that a storm messed up the helicopters so they couldn t carry out the mission . We would be in a way better timeline if Carter got re elected. Environment would be better and more middle class . Reagan really set American back and started this trajectory that lead us to Trump He s got eligibility left  doesn t he Honorable man. Always honest with the American people. Not entirely true. During the failed Iranian hostage rescue mission Delta Army Rangers blew up a fuel truck killing 1  using a shoulder mounted rocket. Trumps Military activities have gone under the radar because he has no concept of transparency  but I m sure that his atrocities will be exposed in the years to come. Forever my personal hero. I am not religious  but Carter  to me  embodies what a Christian should be. And somehow Ronald Reagan wiped the floor with him in the 1980 election.

America is that one girl that keeps dating abusive people lmao. Just imagine how different of a country and world we would ve been if he had won re election and Reagan never happened. What a huge setback that was... I think he is a massively underrated and misunderstood president  but he did authorize a catastrophic rescue mission for American prisoners that resulted in us casualties. It was also part of an operation in which military force was certainly authorized. I don t even disagree with the decision to go ahead with the mission. I just think it s a bit of a hollow thing to say  despite liking the guy. He tried to get the country on solar and wind way back in the 1970s and even put solar panels on the White House roof. First thing Reagan did when he moved in the White House was rip them down along with Jimmy Carter s clean energy policies setting America back 4 decades. That s how you lose reelection cuz this is amurica Most of the time Carter s philosophy is the correct one  yet when a foreign power has 52 American hostages for over a year   and no military action beyond a failed rescue attempt is undertaken  America looks weak and its leader looks weak as well. Sure  Carter s course of action ultimately brought all 52 home safely eventually  but he sacrificed his 2nd term to make it happen. And considering how much America permanently changed during the Reagan Revolution for the worse  satisfying the hawks enough to get reelected in 1980 might have been worth it in other areas of public policy. As Presidential integrity goes none in my lifetime surpasses him. And the country loathed him for it and voted in Regean. Need more Presidents like Carter. I am still proud that the first vote I cast for POTUS as a registered voter was for President Carter. Second best president of my lifetime I m glad FDR couldn t have said this Not killing or bombing people shouldn t be a source of pride. That s the way it s supposed to be. LOL That s why he didn t win a second term  the Military Industrial Complex can t have that  Love this man. A national treasure and hero  removed  Bless you President Carter  you should be very proud of that and many  many other things  Is all the dissing on Carter in this thread what my fellow actual Democrats are thinking or is it brigading  I m suspecting the latter. Carter was screwed by Congress. They didn t want to go along with his programs and didn t give him anything he needed to do his job as the executive. Its so sad that most people hate Jimmy Carter  he was an amazing president who cared about the environment and peace and was such a good person I was really happy for him in 2002  when he won the Nobel Peace Prize. When will he be recognized as a better president than say Reagan  Still one of the most beloved presidents in history  he just really got screwed by the time and his opponent appealed more to the people. Imagine 4 more years of Carter. It would ve been amazing. Hes a man I look up to.  removed  My peanuts went sour  I don t wanna live no more Was Carter the only one   How far back do you have to go to find another who can make the same claim   Hoover  El Salvador would disagree He tried to  they just fucked it up in the desert of Iran. Is this really true  I m guessing if the Iranian hostage rescue would have been a success there would have been a few bullets fired. Ummmm But you did have a criminal talking to our nations enemy while running for election and didn t do anything about that so while respect the character of me Carter he is still a democrat that didn t do the right thing and punch the Republican in the face when they go low. Loooool I m calling bullshit I deeply respect Jimmy Carter  but this is not entirely true.  Carter authorized the infamous raid on Iran in an attempt to use force to resolve the hostage crisis.  At least one Iranian was killed in the botched raid. 

 https   en.wikipedia.org wiki Operation  Eagle  Claw  https   en.wikipedia.org wiki Operation Eagle Claw  We did  however  have a badly planned and executed attempt to rescue hostages in Tehran that wound up with several dead Americans in a desert.

But other than that I love you Jimmy. Hot take  Carter is just an o.k president Coughs  East Timor Genocide  It s an extremely unfortunate reflection on the state of America that such a low standard simply not killing people is regarded so highly. Yeah you just killed the Nuclear Industry instead  something that America has been struggling to recover from the last 30 years and hence why we are no longer world leaders in the technology      removed   removed   removed ",

They cannot connect dots.  They might not even recognize dots. Everything that the Republicans do can be explained with this one quote from Steve Schmidt 

  The Republican Party is an organized conspiracy for the purposes of  maintaining power for self interest  and the self interest of its donor  class.  The best part of this conspiracy is how Democrats only cheated to win the White House  the House but giving Republicans a few more seats there and leaving the Senate to Republicans. 

It s clear what the answer is here. Mitch is obviously in league with them. I ll be honest  I m not sure the GOP even has the word  hypocrisy  in their lexicon. I call mitch s office every week to tell him to check the numbers and that McGrath actually won. Some guy told me so i cant not believe it. 

He also told me McConnell himself was seen with a large brown bag near an election office  im not saying   but we all know. 

Ya know...... Republicans lie  that s the only thing they do well. Republicans get off on power. Because the  ballots in question  only have votes for President on them  they didn t have votes for anything else    It s about damn time we looked Republicans playing 5D tic tac toe I really dislike memes like these because they often lack context or nuance.

If he can keep just one seat there its good enough to achieve what the GOP goal is for the next two years which is to stop the democrats agenda. If he loses both seats the democrats are forced into either a constant filabuster which means he still can stop their agenda or to end the filabuster which gives him more power when the shoe is on the other foot.  


The only real way McConnell loses is if the Dems win both seats  then vote to end the filabuster and then admit Pueto Rico and Washington D.C. Than is a lot of steps which are all a challenge to achieve.",

I m like yeah  that s half true  but he did give nukes back to Iran and then kill their top general leading to a conflict... and he s funding a genocide in Yemen... and he s only increased troops in the middle east until recently when he was confronted by a reporter about it... etc etc so that s how I feel.

I just want to add  because I haven t seen it anywhere  what Trump did in the call.  It s called Gricean   Implicature    https   plato.stanford.edu entries implicature  GricTheo   thanks for the spelling correction  clamence1864   the mods say I can name you  just not tag you  . H. P. Grice developed the theory to explain and predict conversational implicatures  and describe how they arise and are understood.

But that all sounds very academic and dry. So where does this involve Trump  or a crime 

 Glad you asked.  https   philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.com 2012 12 implicature and interpretation of law.html 

 gt A gangster walks into a local restaurant. The restaurant has been doing well recently  and the local criminal gangs are aware of this fact. The gangster walks over to the restaurant owner  stares conspicuously around the room  and says  This is real nice place you got here. It would be a shame if something happened to it. 

 gt Ostensibly  the gangster s statement is one of fact  depending on what the  something  in question is  it may indeed be a shame if it happened to the restaurant. But of course no one reading the statement really thinks it is as innocuous as that. Everyone knows that it constitutes a thinly veiled threat.

You know  because of the implication. 

 This is not the first time Trump s use of implicature has been noticed by linguistic experts.  https   www.colorado.edu linguistics 2020 08 21 trumps use conversational implicature and plausible deniability  Take it away  Abbey Ehrhard at the Department of Linguistics at University of Colorado Boulder...

 gt In my research project  developed for Prof. Adam Hodges course on Language  amp  Politics  I created a video essay that examined the discursive techniques of plausible deniability and conversational implicature used by our president  which are enforced by mafia like structures of silencing. These discursive methods are not new  and Donald Trump is not the first politician to use plausible deniability.

  What did Trump say   

 gt So what are we going to do here  folks  I only need 11 000 votes. Fellas  I need 11 000 votes. Give me a break. You know  we have that in spades already. Or we can keep it going  but that s not fair to the voters of Georgia  because they re going to see what happened  and they re going to see what happened. I mean  I ll  I ll take on to anybody you want with regard to  name  and her lovely daughter  a very lovely young lady  I m sure. But  name  I will  I will take  name .

In mentioning what he wants  he also mentioned that someone has a lovely daughter as well as their own self. A very young lovely daughter. Should these people  especially the very young lovely daughter  the daughter of a Georgia elections employee  who became a target of Trump s legal team  or the other people on the call or ...well  anyone really be worried in Georgia if Trump doesn t get what he wants 

 gt The people of Georgia are angry  and these numbers are going to be repeated on Monday night  along with others that we re going to have by that time  which are much more substantial even  and the people of Georgia are angry  the people of the country are angry. And there s nothing wrong with saying that  you know  um  that you ve recalculated because the 2 236 and absentee ballots  I mean  they re all exact numbers that were  were done by accounting firms  law firms  etc. And even if you cut  em in half  cut  em in half and cut  em in half again  it s more votes than we need.

Trump needs the votes. And people are angry. He can say things like  Liberate  a state and armed people will be on the streets. He s done it before. Angry people all over the country. On Monday. And that person  they have a lovely daughter...

I mean  it s not as though he s asking the Republicans in Georgia to GIVE him votes out of thin air  from a meeting  instead of from votes legitimately counted from ballot boxes  is it 

 gt But we didn t want Cobb County. We wanted Fulton County. And you wouldn t give it to us.

Atlanta is in Fulton County. He actually said  and you wouldn t give it to us    it  being the absentee ballots so they could whine about how people s signatures didn t pass their muster   my signature s a massive thing  I know that on my driver s license it s shrunk down and looks tiny  so I guarantee you they d then want to throw out as many valid votes as they could that just happen to be for Biden under pretense the signatures  don t look right   for a county with a 46.4  minority white population which is one of the most reliably Democratic counties in the entire nation. It has voted Democratic in every presidential election but two since 1876.

 gt ...you should meet tomorrow  because you have a big election coming up  and because of what you ve done to the president  you know the people of Georgia know that this was a scam. And because of what you ve done to the president  a lot of people aren t going out to vote. And a lot of Republicans are going to vote negative  because they hate what you did to the president. OK  they hate it. And they re going to vote  and you would be respected if  really respected if this thing could be straightened out before the election. You have a big election coming up on Tuesday. And therefore  I think that it really is important that you meet tomorrow and work out on these numbers.

You know. Just meet up. Specifically for an exact number of votes.

 gt So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11 780 votes  which is one more than we have because we won the state.

Or keep it going  really run the tally up ...you know what  that s not fair of me because if you do that they re going to see what happened  and they re going to see what happened. Let s just say the bare minimum. You can do the bare minimum  right  Find me the votes. From At fucking lanta. Just find them. In the meeting. Because of angry people. We  won  the state but just  find  what is needed. For me. By the way   name redacted  has a lovely young daughter. A very lovely young lady I m sure...

EDIT   disgruntledcabdriver pointed out that I should expand on the whole thing he said with the 11 780. These bits are where Trump drops the soft implicating stuff and goes straight to the 

 gt And you re going to find that they are   which is totally illegal  it is more illegal for you than it is for them  because you know what they did  and you re not reporting it. That s a criminal  that s a criminal offense. And you can t let that happen. That s a big risk to you and to Ryan  your lawyer. And that s a big risk. But they are shredding ballots  in my opinion  based on what I ve heard. And they are removing machinery  and they re moving it as fast as they can  both of which are criminal finds. And you can t let it happen  and you are letting it happen. You know  I mean  I m notifying you that you re letting it happen. So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11 780 votes  which is one more than we have because we won the state.

So he s believing the conspiracy theories... and as a result he s openly threatening a politician and his legal advisor to get exactly what he wants. That part isn t cloaked in gentle euphemism   oh no  this is outright  I ll make things tough for you  get people motivated against you with the story I just mentioned  unless you give me what I want .

Then there s this too. 

 gt Oh  I don t know  look  Brad. I got to get   I have to find 12 000 votes  and I have them times a lot. And therefore  I won the state. That s before we go to the next step  which is in the process of right now. You know  and I watched you this morning  and you said  uh  well  there was no criminality. But I  I mean  all of this stuff is very dangerous stuff. When you talk about no criminality  I think it s very dangerous for you to say that.

This next step ...is it anything to do with Brad being in danger if he dares mention reality  Again  not cloaked in gentle implicature there.  It s very dangerous for you to say that  is pretty upfront. 

Do you know how many times he mentions the 11 779 votes he lost by 

Eleven. Eleven times in this one call.

Lock him up. I will begrudingly give him credit for standing up to diaper don. Kind of ridiculous that the bar for Republicans is so low that them literally just doing their jobs makes them heroes and Patriots. This is why we keep losing. Brad Raffensperger has  like Brian Kemp before him  presided over unprecedented efforts to disenfranchise Black and brown voters in Georgia. He and his Republican friends have done everything in their power to keep Democrats and PoC Georgians out of power  and it s only because of their incompetence and the resilience of activists like LaTosha Brown and Stacey Abrams that we barely won in November. 

Can we please stop carrying water for garbage Republicans who do the bare minimum like  not committing treason   We ve got folks  many leftists who are actually Democrats  being castigated and shunned by the party for daring to look beyond their noses  but we heap praise on people like this guy and Comey and others for  no good reason  Make it make sense. He s still pushing the POS trump worshipping GOP candidates in Georgia and continues Georgia s efforts to disenfranchise voters. Pretty sure there s still voter suppression going on in the Georgia Senatorial race. He s not a hero just for not breaking the law. What an insanely low bar. I wouldn t go so far as to say he s a hero. This dude is personally responsible for some of the most draconian election laws in the country. The bar is so low that we call a Republican a hero who simply does their job. STOP THIS. He s awful.

All he did was not commit election fraud. You know who else did that  Basically every other SoS He s still responsible for other voter suppression. Congrats to him for having self respect and standing up to ol  Orange face  but he s not a  hero . That word gets tossed around too much. Mueller is also a Republican.

The party loyalties lie solely with Trump. Lookalike of the Twelfth Doctor from the planet Gallifrey. I wonder how many similar phone calls Trump made to other officials asking them to  find votes . Raffensberger was smart enough to record it and send it to the Washington Post. How many others weren t that smart  or that honest  This gentleman does get some credit.  But he still did the Republican voter suppression thing.  So while  yes  he appears to be standing for honesty now  he doesn t get a Profiles in Courage Award.  Actually I wonder if the real Profiles in Courage Awards feel the same way. It s sad that the bar for heroic Republican has fallen to only  doesn t support coups . I miss when McCain and Romney were standard Republicans instead of some of the best. RIP John McCain. A hero or patriot would have left the republican party 40 years ago. The terms are mutually exclusive. Trump voter. Dude supported Trump all the way until HE was asked to participate in the criming. 

 Hero  is a bridge too far for me. No hero. Recording the conversation was to protect his white ass. He knew trump would lie and threaten him. The recording is his proof. He DID do his job  but no hero... It will stay that way on this matter at least. No way he stands up to trump on the phone call then gives in after the call and his refusal is made public. Democrats rehabbing the republican party  not realizing they are playing into trump s hands by making him a  criminal  that will only fire up his base. I can t remember. But  I didn t down vote you  I think I was thinking he chose democracy.   Hero. Patriot. Republican. Almost extinct. You know it s sad when someone who does this basic shit is now considered a hero. Just how far have our standards for RepuliKKKans sunk  Lol. Knight of the Old Republic an party. We shouldn t have to count on Patriotism but okay Thank God there still some elected officials with morals. Pretty unbelievable. Well he s not a moron. Idk why anyone would cooperate with a lame duck president. He won t get another term so time to rip the band aid off This is cringe lol. He did the bare minimum. Stop praising these guys  More like man who didn t commit election fraud. It s incredibly sad when doing one s job and not falsifying an election makes one a hero. Dude spent the last 6 months trying to make it harder for black people in Georgia to vote. And then this week did the bare minimum by refusing to break the law. But go off  I guess. I m sorry but this guy is no fucking hero. Repuglicans like this guy have been complicit in trump s crimes for YEARS now  protecting and enabling him every step of the way. The only reason this guy leaked the phone call was to cover his own ass. He doesn t care about the people or the law  he doesn t care that trump is a criminal  he only released the tape after he was targeted by trump publicly. It s purely self interest at play here  not patriotism. There are a few good  decent  honorable Republicans but very few for sure. Thank you  sir.  You are a true  Profile in Courage   Just goes to show that even Republicans are good decent people and actually care about America and Justice. It s  mostly  Trump that worsened the Republican Party.",

A  vote  is only a roll call to see who objects and who doesn t and get them on record.

It s actually not their job to  vote   it s to count electoral votes that have already been cast  certified by the sates and cannot be overturned. 

It s a show to delay the for a couple hours and that s it. I think the key is that both house and senate must agree to overturn a states electors  which I don t see happening due to the Dems having the house. 

One issue I hadn t heard about  and not sure how it works  but I heard about a  5 day  rule. My understanding from what I read is  if they don t have a full count in 5 days  then the counting stops. If neither candidate has 270 electoral votes  it goes to the house and each state has one vote.

I don t know how accurate this is  or if it would be possible. The only way it could possibly work  is each state is challenged  but even then  that s 2 hours max per state  plus vote time.",

Both of these would hurt the GOP in future elections. While it s ghastly I just can t get too worked up about it because  well  we already knew he was doing this. 

Hell  it leaked that he suggested an actual military coup and the only reason he didn t do it is his advisers didn t think they could pull it off. 

Nobody really cares. That s         ed up  but it is what it is. The difference is that elected officials USED to know when the corruption was too much.

t3_kqc97y,Do I belong here,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/kqc97y/do_i_belong_here/,"Yes. The Democratic Party is a big tent. There are lots of pro life democrats. 

In Colorado  they realized that lack of access to birth control was a primary reason for lots of abortions  so they introduced a program to give universal affordable or free access to birth control. Ever since Colorado started that program  their number of abortions per capita has declined faster than every other state in the country.

I personally consider myself both pro life and pro choice. I believe that Roe v Wade should remain as is  but we should do everything we can to lower the number of abortions so eventually the only reason someone gets an abortion is due to medical necessity.

Welcome to the big tent. Welcome to the Democratic Party  

Try to remember that on social media  progressives  who would attack a pro life liberal  have an outsized popularity  that doesn t apply to the real world. So  if you re attacked on social media by progressives as not being pure enough for them  it does NOT mean that the average American Democrat wouldn t welcome you with open arms. I was a convert following the Bush Jr. administration. One of the things I ve noted is that the Democrats aren t an all or nothing cult like the Republicans have become  however I have noted of late that Republicans that want to jump ship are demanding that Democrats abandon a lot of their basic tenants in order to be more palatable  which is something I completely disagree with. There are things I disagree with from a party platform  and that s OK...if I agree with everything than there s probably something wrong. 

If your stance is due to religious reasons you may want to really think about legislating morality based off of Biblical law  as it is not only unconstitutional  but is a very slippery slope that can open up us up to a theocracy. You can be a Democrat  there s a ton of disagreement in the party. Our symbol is a jackass because we re a stinky unruly mob. That s why we re always in disarray and why we d love to have you in the tent  welcome to The Democracy. Welcome  In the 90 s  the Democratic position on abortion was famously to make it  safe  legal  and rare.  There are a range of reasonable positions that Democrats take on every topic. You will certainly be in good company among Democrats pushing for increased access to birth control  and support for low income families. Senator Bob Casey  PA  is a pro life Democrat and a solid member of the party. 

There s no one to say you can t be a Democrat because you differ with the party on a particular issue.

Welcome to the club. I am anti abortion but pro choice. I have voted Democrat in the past 7 elections.  I think abortion is morally wrong  but you can t legislate morality and the Supreme Court has decided as such. I agree that a woman has the right to her choice even though I don t agree with the choice. Being a member of any party doesn t force you to agree with their beliefs and policies. I respect your civility and honesty  sir. There are lots of us pro lifers in the Democratic Party. I support prevention of unwanted pregnancies programs  and education to drive down unwanted pregnancies. I also do not believe it is our place to legislate this  as it is a personal choice not one I would make   with health  financial  and general life implications that we  as a country  do not provide any basic safety nets. There are so many children born that go hungry  uneducated  and uncared for...if I am not willing to address that with taxes  then I am just pushing a problem onto a baby and saying tough luck kid  should have gotten better parents.

Of course  there are other circumstances  but this is one that makes me recognize some shortcomings of banning abortions. You are welcome here. Replace Democrat with  Decent Human Being 

Thats your answer  gt I am pro life  but I recognize that roe v wade will never be overturned.

It s almost not even a political issue. It s unlikely to be overturned. It does divide the parties  but as far as any real  tangible impact... there s not much  due to like you said  the unlikelyhood of it changing. 

Democrats won t like your opinion on this issue  but I don t really think it means you can t be one. Welcome  I was also raised conservative with the pro life issue being the main reason my parents voted GOP throughout the 90s 00s. I did a lot of researching and soul searching from 2011 2014  and I decided that I align 90  with the Democratic Party. I haven t looked back since. Here let me reply with the following things that make me ok with you being a democrat concerning what seems like ur most pressing issue.

Pro choice policies. Leave abortion alone and acknowledge as a right that should be easily accessible. Likewise support those programs that would prevent the need for it   real sex education and birth controle and better funding for social and adoptive services.

How do you feel about taxes   addressing wealth inequality   stagnating wages   and stbings like universal college tuition and healthcare  You most certainly can be a democrat. As mentioned it s a big tent party which is why it s hard to satisfy everyone  but Dems believe government should have a role in helping people. 

The difference between Republicans and Democrats on abortion is that Democrats think abortion should be between a woman and her doctor. If you are against abortions  that s fine... but what gives Republicans the right to make a decision about what a woman chooses  It s why people like President Elect Biden have personal beliefs of being pro life but won t force it on others and respect pro choice being the best platform for the Democratic Party.

It s irony at it s finest. Republicans want small government with little involvement in people s lives except for that issue. Honesty at this point the only qualifying belief to be a Democrat instead of a Republican is that you believe elections should determine who is in charge.  


It is democracy vs.  republic   Republic loosely defined as whatever keeps RepublicANS in power . You can still be pro life and also believe that it s none of the government s business what goes on between a person and their doctor. Everyone here has different positions it s what s kept the Democratic Party strong and vibrant instead of a cult on the verge of tearing itself apart. Personally I m extremely pro gun compared to my fellow democrats  that dosent mean I m not allowed in this party  and it dosent mean that other democrats want me out of the party   you ll find hardline leftists out there that might feel that way  but you ll find their a very loud but very small minority of the party . This is the party that celebrates diversity and freedom  including that of opinion. So welcome to the party  we re all glad to have you here. I m a lifelong Democrat  but got kicked off r politics in a systematic fashion in five months after earning over 150 000 karma points. Singlehandedly got the members to think of Biden as more progressive  which worked. But  the mods seemed to not like my anti Trump stance.",

Only way he could do that is to either lock them all up  or take them all out. Hopefully Congress and DC make it through January 6.
