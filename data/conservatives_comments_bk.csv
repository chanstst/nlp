t3_kvbi43,Elon Musk A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvbi43/elon_musk_a_lot_of_people_are_going_to_be_super/,He was smart to get the fuck outta California.  Yup  I m moving out of California  bought in July a new construction .  Good for you. I hope to be outta here by the end of the year.  I m rooting for you. I m in TX now doing some inspections before drywall. It is night and day from California  indoor dining  folks are so nice  people seem happier.  A local buddy of mine just bought a place south of Tampa. He moves into his new place the first week of Feb. I ll be checking out the area in April.  Lol moving to tampa area in a few weeks myself  Already been down and accepted a job. Absolutely beautiful there.  Small world  Best wishes.  Haha i think everyone is moving to texas and florida. I read it everywhere. Im in Ohio and you  39 d think with as red as we are we would be off lockdowns  nope  Cuz dewine is a bitch boy. Hashtag impeachdewine.  Hopefully they don  39 t ruin Texas and Florida...  Fingers crossed. Hopefully they understand WHY their state was so undesirable.  It  39 s happening  Amazing how all the blue state people are moving to red states  which contain people they despise and think are nazis  They  39 ll be shocked when they see us goose stepping and reading our mandatory mein kamf books   Live in central FL  it is awesome here.  em everything  em  is open and life is normal  That  39 s what I  39 ve been told. A friend was viewing properties in the area around Sarasota in late fall and couldn  39 t believe the bars were open.  South of Tampa... code for bradenton Sarasota. Great place to live  Anyplace that is the home of the Macho Man is a great place in my book  No please  Welcome to Texas   I bet they are. Please make sure to leave all CA policies and bullshit in CA.  Welcome to Texas  Lifelong Texan here  DFW  just wanted to say    Man I  39 m so jealous of y  39 all. Looking to move there as soon as I graduate college in California in like a year and a half.  Welcome to Texas   Always hopeful when I read another side of CA is moving in. Lol    Absolutely. California is going down the drain. This is what you get when you let the blue meanies have their way. It s an object lesson for the rest of the country.  Pretty much everyone I know here in CA has at least one family member leaving the state to either Idaho  Texas  or Florida. Another friend is heading to Southeast Asia once the borders open back up.  Careful about the South East Asia  it  39 s being overrun by the CCP.   Especially in Cambodia. I used to work overseas and have been traveling throughout SEA since the late 90 s. The cost of living is the main draw for me.  Wow. That s a lot of people.  Make a new internet Elon. You  39 re in Texas now  build a Texan internet. With blackjack  and hookers   When neurolink and starlink are fully functional we won  39 t need that old internet.  Taps head   Fantastic.  So google and amazon will simple disable us if we misbehave then.  He  39 s in the process of building starlink. I wonder if through that they could redo the way internet works to make it more friendly to free speech somehow   In fact  forget the internet   I guess the downvote means someone never watched Futurama.  Well  Set up the competition then Elon.  I wonder what sort of land based infrastructure is part of star link  if it  39 s capable web hosting  cloud services and the like.  I can t wait for Starlink. Musk should build a soup to nuts infrastructure over everyone s heads  just so he can show them how it s done.  Starlink is just the network  to my knowledge all data centers are ground based  so data still stored on Terra. I made a separate comment elsewhere that maybe phase 2 is to get some data centers in LEO where you could truly host your apps in the cloud     I can  39 t imagine data centers would handle heat and power requirements very well in the vacuum of space.  Data centers have  em massive  em  cooling and energy loads.  No he needs to buy Facebook and Twitter then delete them. Leave a page that says  go outside . If he did that I would do everything in my power to work for him. He s a good dude.  I know you re joking but Facebook is worth around  700 billion  Now  Myspace was once  valued at  12 billion at its peak fourteen years ago.  Difference is facebook branched out. They arent just facebook anymore.  Still  same metric applies and they can  39 t continue to keep buying the competition up when their core business is faltering.  You are wrong though. Facebook is not faltering it is thriving. They have 60 billion in cash and 33  YoY growth. Along with having NO short or long term debt.  I guess we  39 ll see  no I be stays number one in social media forever.  And Musk has a  200  billion right now  well on his way to deleting them.  Not really.  Tesla would have to reach a market cap of close to 4 trillion in order for Elon to be worth  700 billion.  And even then the amount of stock he has isn t liquid enough to just dump  Be even better to watch them dwindle to the new MySpace and they don t get paid anything for it.  Haha  that would be amazing.  Seriously get us out of this Elon  Like parler   I would think Elon would do something parler did not. Make sure it has its own infrastructure. Depending on Amazon Web Services was just asking for trouble. That  39 s why gab is still online.  Which is why you basically need to create your own financial institution first.  If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch  you must first invent the universe.  Probably just need to start a new country. Everyday I  39 m more okay with this. We can have the  quot flyover quot  states that they already loathe and they can have the coasts. After the split they can figure out how to feed themselves and who will do the actual work. It should be fun to watch.  You need to go back and re read the constitutional conventions and the federalist papers. There was a reason that the founding fathers didn  39 t make separate nations   war is the only outcome. It  39 s just human nature.  I honestly think this is going to be his move with starlink.  Gab is better anyway.  Dude has so much on his plate already. But I wouldnt put it past him. I  39 d support any endeavour he did anyway  One of the few based guys with real FU money.  Well the other guys know they re protected  If he speaks out against the new overlords  that FU money will not be worth much.  If you own a company that makes the most advanced space ship  39 s known to man I think any amount of money is FU money.  I  39 m a little wary trusting one sole person to be our solution to the tech problem. But if he releases his own phone I  39 ll definitely switch if not just to watch Apple and Google burn  All it takes is one.  If he makes a legitimate competitor he could pull a huge chunk of people over  simply by making the internet like it use to be.  Free and open.  MIGA.  The Tesla phone... the T phone ... insta buy for me  One of the few that gets it. I am and have been a Muskite for a while. I  39 ll continue to be one.  they weren  39 t very happy with his demands to his reopen the plant during covid  I mean  it  39 s still during COVID  and by the looks it will be for awhile.  Shit has to open sooner or later.  People need to realize this.  Too bad the left has an abundant of unemployed young folk who don  39 t have to worry about jobs to really grasp this understanding as it doesn  39 t directly affect them yet.  Ain t that the truth   What should the national voting age be instead  The way I see it is that an 18 year old will vote for whoever backs them financially.  24 should be the age  in my opinion  You gonna raise the enlistment age to 24 also   If you can fight and die for your country  you deserve ALL rights of an adult.  True. And I  39 m sure the left aren  39 t thrilled with him making this comment either. And him calling the cave rescuer  quot Pedo Guy quot  wasn  39 t very popular. But  when you  39 re the richest guy in the world and a freakin  39  genius  it  39 s okay  or at least okay to not give a care  to speak your mind  take a toke  etc.  Lol i remember that. Its all good  we all say dumb shit once in a while.  I already respected Elon but that fiasco solidified my liking him  When I found out he was a Torb main in Overwatch  I then knew he knew what was up.  What s very interesting is that Musk seems to always be many steps ahead of the crowd. Only hope is this is no exception.  I used to... rather strongly dislike him some years back  but the same can be said for Trump  and I  39 m willing to admit my mistakes. This guy  em gets it  em  and I regret letting my personal feelings be swayed by the idiot crowd.  He seems to be the only person interested in saving the human race for the long term by getting us off this planet.  Well  I was honestly hoping all the commies would volunteer to go to mars and live their utopia.  That would require work.  Commies don t want to work for a living.  That is why they are commies.  Unfortunately history shows that the exiled are the anti communists  that is why we vote republican.  I d want to get off this planet too if I lived in California.  Maybe he ll change his mind now that he s moved somewhere rooted in reality.  I mean we  39 re not leftists  you don  39 t have to agree with  em everything  em  the guy says and does. I can still think Tesla  39 s build quality is subpar among other issues  while also acknowledging Elon often makes good points politically.  He does lie and hype things a lot and the hyperloop is a fucking joke. Still  he  39 s the only rich guy out there who doesn  39 t dance the tune of fascism.  Agree....I m not fond of Musk s PT Barnum marketing tactics and don t like Tesla  but I gained some respect for the dude after reading this.  How much y all wanna bet that Elon starts his own social media platform   I honestly thought he already had one  If he could run for president  I would vote for him without hesitation.  He  39 s pro UBI. Pretty sure he  39 s called himself a socialist too. However  he doesnt seem to have that SJW strain in him so i can tolerate that.  I believe the UBI comes from his beliefs in complete automation which he initially tried with the Model 3. He did learn that a good mix of human and robots are more productive at this time. He has also spoke out against unchecked AI.  How could he possibly be a socialist   Dude idk. He  39 s the poster boy for capitalism. But he  39 s said it himself. Who knows. I like him either way tho  he  39 s a character.  If he did say that he  39 s probably doing what 99  of  quot socialists quot  do and that is call Social Democracy like in Sweden and Norway  Socialism. Which is wrong and dumb.  Could be cultural socialism he  39 s referring to which would be more like a sort of niceness or compassion towards people and harnessing each individual  39 s abilities to trade for another  39 s in the same vein as middle ages townsfolk did  all with different capabilities and wares  and each individual  39 s contribution no less or greater than the other. The blacksmith makes your knives and the farmer grows your vegetables. The doctor treats your sick and the artist paints your portrait. They are all equal.  Socialism is just a belief that social programs can do good. The problem is finding social programs that don t infringe on individual rights. Roadways  military  basic infrastructure are all great social programs that benefit everyone. Socialism lately has gained a very bad connotation for a very good reason though... not because social programs are inherently bad but because the people pushing them are proposing dangerous extremes that threaten core personal liberties.   Socialism is not just the belief that social programs are good. Social programs have NOTHING to do with socialism. Socialism is a theory of government by which the means of production  exchange  etc are owned by the community. A   39 co op  39  type of business is an example  where a community of workers all share ownership and have equal compensation. So imagine Bezos getting the same pay as a warehouse packer. The concepts are pretty stupid and not practical and is basically a bridge to communism  whereby the state owns the means of production .  What I don  39 t get is how flaires users on this sub don  39 t even know what socialism is. Social security is not socialism  it is a social program. Services the government providers have nothing to do with socialism. Grrr.  He could fund a surrogate easily enough.  He was also commenting on a bee article.  Elon Musk has the capital to start up his own social media platform and news network if he wanted to.  Does he actually have that much liquid capital  His net worth is tied up in his companies. He  39 s stated before he doesn  39 t have that much cash just laying around.  Even his compensation as CEO is paid in stock  He has 12 milestones each one awarding him about 1  of the outstanding stock.   The thing is  I don  39 t think anybody would have a problem with it if their standards were equally applied. Like  if I ran a social media company and we want to keep calls to violence off there  that  39 s totally reasonable to delete that material or suspend an account.   Russia collusion for 3 straight years.  Every single day in the headlines.    to be fair  they  39 ll just blame republicans like they do for the high cost of college  He  39 s one of the good ones.  Elon has the funds to start his own social media platform with his own servers  his own payment processing system  his own email service  literally everything. Now is a perfect time to do it.  All you moving out of California better be voting Republican. If not all you are doing is ruining another state  Not happening.  Watch out Elon you are going to be banned too from all media platforms.  Even countries that are not fans of Trump at all are speaking out against this. How can they not see that this is real bad   Between Hollywood and silicon valley is there a more cancerous state in the US  One spews bile and propaganda and the other censors those that don t buy into it.  Lets not forget the education system that is brainwashing entire generations.  Don t California my Florida    I would LOVE to see him start speaking out about all this craziness. He could have some influence.  Did anybody actually read the article  What on earth was that first paragraph....   We all know that big tech is going to play both sides. They are only cutting off for now because they think it will give them good PR and make them look virtuous  when in reality they are only calling attention to themselves.  Tennessee welcomes all conservatives   Twitter  Facebook  Google  Apple  and Amazon are basically the Walmart of information transmission and things like Parler  gab  etc are the mom and pop shops.  I wish we could go back to the 90  39 s and early 2000  39 s. IRC chats and message boards scattered everywhere.  Should  39 ve been born then like me. Get off my lawn.  Save us Elon  Elon Musk could probably get the funding together to create servers to compete with Amazon and google... JS if he wanted to he could replatform Parler and whatnot  Dems are free to kiss. my. ass.   Honestly this might lead to a bipartisan talking point  Tech has monopolized too much and it  39 s time to break them up  Told you guys to drop your social media bullshit a few months ago.  Elon throw that weight around and buy Twitter and tell them to fuck off  Musk should start his own social media   The silly thing is that these social media companies have been the arbiters of speech for a long time. Banning Trump was just a blatant use of power. They could have just as easily turned down his  relevance score  influence whatever so that people couldn t see his posts. If you think that Twitter is just some transparent medium through which communication flows  I have a bridge to sell you.  A comfort  knowing the richest man in the world cares more about freedom than feelings.  Musk 2024     
t3_kv8utu,Elon Musk Advises People to Ditch Facebook and Use Signal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv8utu/elon_musk_advises_people_to_ditch_facebook_and/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  https   discord.gg conservative  a   Upsides of Signal are the ability to use it on your desktop laptop and text and call other Signal users. Other upsides are end to end encryption  until it is banned.   I  39 ve used signal for years  but I  39 m kinda a whore for privacy and security.  You say you are diligent about privacy and security  but this links your personal phone  Is it really that secure    Edward Snowden recommended Signal many years ago. It  39 s good. I  39 ve used it  You can already do this with apps like Google  39 s Messages app and Windows 10  39 s phone app  which also lets you wirelessly connect to your phone.   What about if you text someone not using signal   The quality can drop due to loss of signal  Signal just replaces your default SMS messenger  so it passes through as a normal text message.  On iOS I don  39 t know if you can change default messenger. Have not looked into it. They only just came around to letting you change your default browser lol.  If I am not mistaken Signal is for sending messages right  How is this a replacement for Facebook or Twitter   A ton of people use Facebook exclusively for FB Messenger. Several of my family members and kids fall under this category.  It replaces the messaging component. Signal  39 s schtick is that everything is encrypted end to end.  My guess is he  39 s talking about Messenger mainly  but I could be wrong on that.  Mostly I want to be able to make backups without having all my unencrypted conversations handed over to Google to analyse  the only backup option for WhatsApp is an unencrypted zip file uploaded to Google Drive  which  of course  Google can peruse at their leisure .  It seems like he is the only Billionaire speaking against the censorship  All the others seem to be jerking each other off in rapid succession.  Elon is our guy.  I didn  39 t used to like Elon  no real reason  not a big fan of electric cars I guess  and he has a huge fan base. BUT he is literally the only person with the juice to oppose a complete takeover of the US by globalists.   You  39 re right.  My friends think that the beltway would be nice to Sanders when they were mean to Trump  then I ask them about the rigged primary for Hillary and they shut up.  I laughed when the Dems cheated Sanders. I am not laughing now.  It s even funnier when you re realize that the Dems have been pushing removing the electoral college.  The good news is that the process just got simple. The CEOs of all the tech companies along with a few select Democrats now choose who will be the next president.  All the people have to do is be good little sheep and vote them in  Just an fyi an electric car has the fastest pikes peak time right now. So they are coming around. Just need distance for them now.  I always liked Tesla because they  39 re actually decent looking  what is the obsession with making all the other electric hybrid cars so ugly   .  He was the only one who spoke out against the lockdowns relatively early. Huge respect for this guy.  If I ever run for an elected position in our Federal Government  and I legitimately hope I get the opportunity to one day   Elon is the first person I m talking to. Not because he s a Democrat or a Republican  but because he s nether   he s an American first.  I thought he was South African first...      a href  http   memes.ucoz.com  nw 11 23334591.jpg  Every country in the world belongs to America  a   LMAO  I can imagine it now.   Technically he said FEDERAL government.   Elon honesty is a good doobie. Dude has said he s going to donate half his wealth to get to Mars.   He needs to watch total recall then.  Cohagen they need air    Get yourself to Mahs     quot I wish I had three hands. quot   This marks the start of the great digital wars of 2021 and 2024 25.   Anyone that uses Facebook messenger or SMS Text messenger on an Android phone doesn  39 t care about privacy. If you care at all about the privacy of your conversations  never use them. I have proof that Google harvests your private SMS conversations. Even if one party is on an iPhone and the other is Android  Google still gets it all. Very important that if you care at all about privacy you switch to Signal. Elon is spot on with this....  Well yeah  bezos and co make a living harvesting data on our personalities.  Well  I hung them up.  I have no personality.  Wait what  Are you saying that...even without these apps on my cell  Google is getting my SMS text messages   If you use an Android phone app to send receive SMS  yes. They absolutely do.  I just send and receive text messages. No app. like whatsapp or anything.  If you are using your Android phone to send SMS messages  thats all it takes. Google gets it all...  Fucking slime...  Please don t become  em another  em  technocrat  Musk actually  strong makes stuff  strong  and  strong does things  strong .  Musk before he started being conservative  reddit darling  can do no wrong  jesus 2.0  although  a href   r teenagers  r teenagers  a  worships him more than ever.  Because he memes  I doubt those idiots know anything about him beyond that time he smoked weed with Joe Rogan  Add Terry Crews.  He also still innovates instead of just turning into a merger  amp  acquisitions mogul like all the other Big Tech firms. The ones with monopolies on all of the internet speech.  Now they figured out how to save money.  They just collude to destroy their competitors instead of buying them.  Yes  they  39 re only getting lazier.  Exactly... the whole dream of the  quot startup quot  world now is to just be acquired by the big guys for a big amount of money. Why is it like this  Because  the juggernauts out there that is literally their whole strategy now. It  39 s little innovation. Everyone else does that now. They just buy out any potential competition  and if they like their features or tech enough they  39 ll absorb it to their own. Otherwise  they just kill it.  Reminds me of Mad Men if you ever saw it. The whole series it s basically a small advertising trying to get different contracts with big products  Like Coca Cola  Pam Am  Dodge  Hershey s  etc . Eventually they get bought out by one of the top 3 companies in NY. The protagonist then is given an assignment to advertise for Milwaukee beer. The owner of the massive company nonchalantly says  We just bought you a firm out of Milwaukee to help us with this pitch...  crazy how the big fish eat the little fish in business.  But that  39 s how it  39 s always been.  It  39 s basically impossible to innovate as a large company  especially a publicly traded large company  because there are too many stakeholders to tolerate risky moves.  Small companies are nimble  and privately owned small companies can take huge risks  because the ownership group is small and it  39 s easy to get the employees to change the company  39 s course.  Once a company grows to a certain point  it inevitably must become relatively stable in its mission.  It develops inertia both because of the sheer number of employees  but also because of the number of public shareholders.  He s already proven that he s not. Surprised twitter haven t banned him.  Soon.  Better download it before it gets taken off all app stores  s but not really  s  If you can convince enough left wing friends to join Signal  like Twitter CEO  then the app won  39 t be banned.  I literally had that thought and just did that.  I have no trust in billionaires helping us little guys having our voices heard.  Neither do I  but Musk did give California the middle finger when they tried to restrict Tesla. He  39 s no fan of censorship. He may be our best option.  Watch any interview with musk  he comes off as a real genuine guy. There s a reason he hasn t been outed in congressional hearings  ever. I m not gonna glorify everything he does  but he s without a doubt an amazing ally for freedom.  Well  he  39 s from South Africa.  Those people don  39 t fuck around anymore  not after what their country turned into.  My brother  39 s girlfriend is from SA.  Her parents are deaf and fled the country back in the 90s when she was a baby.  She  39 s  quot progressive quot  as all white urbanite women in their 30s are required to be.  I asked her  quot So why did your parents leave  quot   I knew the answer  I was just messing with her.   She got quiet and simply said  quot It was getting bad  they had to leave. quot   Except for that entire pedophile libel case. Very shameful what Elon did.  Honestly I can forgive him that. He offered to donate a sub to rescue the kids and got told to shove it up his ass by a weird expat Brit  with Thai bride half his age  who wanted all the glory.  He called the dude a pedophile.  not a pedophile  And spoke out against lockdowns.  I think when it comes to this type of stuff.   I trust Elon.   He  39 s a asshole to a lot of  quot woke quot  people you have to be nice to.   I generally think he does not care  he seems to be really black and white in a almost on the spectrum kind of way.  Did I mention he hates data collection and AI.  And he s one of the reasons the term POC or black has become more popular than African American.  Musk actually is an African American  literally.  So is anyone else in America  seeing as how Man originated in Africa.  Musk knows he s a target for being in less than lockstep with the Progunist Party.  Is Signal any good to a person without other Signal contacts   No. And that  39 s what makes Facebook and Twitter so powerful. Communications is a natural monopoly if you control the protocol.  Thanks. I  39 m all for using better  more secure tools for communication. My circle of friends are like most Americans  unaware  uninvolved  and apathetic to what is happening all around us. Sadly  Signal won  39 t do anything for me but make me unreachable. I may as well downgrade to a flip phone.  Since signal and twatter are in bed with each other it seems... telegram is your next best option.  People keep talking about how we need new alternatives.   Trump may play an important role also. As we ve learned from 2020  there is no law. There is only power. Elon   Trump are our two based billionaires.  Trump said on his official account after he got permabanned that soon we  his supporters  won  39 t have to worry about being targetted and abused online for a  quot very  very long time. quot  whatever that means.  If someone like him got red pilled all the way we could really be going places.   He doesn  39 t even have to be a conservative. He can be liberal all he wants. He just has to appreciate the constitution  freedom  privacy  etc. And then build something to protect it.   removed   To date  no one has explained to me what  39 s WRONG with doing any of those things.  What  39 s worse is the game had a mature language filter  so no one  39 s delicate sensitivities could be offended by coarse words provided they used that feature. Unfortunately  their fee fee  39 s could still be hurt and we can  39 t have that   When my cousin and I were about 13  we handed his mic to our grandmother who then proceeded to use the mic to talk to people.   It  39 s insane that the original call of duty kids throwing slurs and insults over the slightest inconvenience in a game have grown up to be the most prude and speech policing group ever seen in thisncointey  I  39 m trying to picture someone saying that to either of my grandma  39 s. Pretty sure the speaker would have received a very colorfully phrased response. Neither of them cursed often  but when they did it was epic.  Nope you  39 re toxic now  banned.  Reminder that Reddit banned the donald but still to this day allows North Korea   much of whose population lives in slave labor camps   to run a sub. You ll be very surprised to learn they mod it with an iron fist  Did it years ago.........Facebook is a social media cancer  Isn  39 t Signal owned by Twitter      Waaaay ahead of you Musky  Yeah they going to ban this  unauthorized communication is strictly forbidden  It is  em Conservative  em  communication that is strictly forbidden.   removed   You know   if it hadn  39 t been for Facebook purging Conservatives I might not have taken this as seriously as I should have.  Eventually we will all be back on icq  Musk keeps doing cool things. Perhaps the coolest tech billionaire.  Why did jack retweet  a href  https   twitter.com elonmusk status 1347165127036977153 s 20  this   a  does Twitter own them   Because someone tweeted a picture of Parler being number 1 on the app store.  That s correct. However  the signal retweet of Elon came way before the picture jack posted  Go to Signal  39 s website and Jack  39 s face is one of the first things to greet you with a glowing review. That alone makes me unable to trust this thing. Jack Dorsey is clearly in on it somehow.  By proxy  it seems like it.  a href  https   en.wikipedia.org wiki Whisper Systems  Whisper Systems  a  was acquired by Twitter in 2011.  quot Open Whisper Systems quot  owns Signal. Somewhere after Twitter buying the original Whisper Systems  Moxie Marlinspike left Twitter to found Open Whisper Systems. In 2015 this Open Whisper Systems merged with RedPhone  owned by Twitter . So Signal is most certainly attached to Twitter in some way.  I can t see the retweet but on their site he did endorse Signal so that s made me hesitant to sign up.  Aren t these totally different types of platforms   Isn t signal just encrypted SMS  essentially   The problem is the entire tech organization. User data has been monetized and that is the only way to make it in the current environment. Companies LOVE user data and will pay for it. Companies in turn support expansion of the current tech organization to get even more user data. It is a self feeding environment. Users become reliant on the organization because the companies expand their presence. When people only use Facebook or Google  to look for goods and services  a company is forced to embrace the industry model. It is a monopoly no doubt  but one that was smart to pay off the prosecutors.  Damn I said it in jest  but Elon really might be the one to help the right being silenced.  The only thing that Signal is similar to Facebook is  is Facebook Messenger. So  I don  39 t get his point.  Signal is more similar to WhatsApp  which due to the new privacy policy WhatsApp just issued is what  39 s stirring up all this recent push from WhatsApp  which is owned by Facebook  to Signal.  Signal is majority owned by Jack Dorsey  right  Telegram seems the way to go IMO.  Facebook account deleted.  Please join me in the post woke world.  Does he have stock in Signal   Jfc just build another platform already elon    The democrats are insisting that all conservatives go to their own separate institutions.
t3_kvhyq3,Sorry Cleveland,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvhyq3/sorry_cleveland/,Fox called the Ravens winners halfway through their playoff game   Half way  Probably right after the first half kickoff.  They called it with the initial projections   Any point switch glitches on the scoreboard   Still don t get why y all are so mad at fox. They were literally right lmao  They weren  39 t  it would be like if I called the Ravens winning but my predictions for the final score were totally off.  And they still end up being correct  Fox would call a hot day cold  and you  39 d belive it  Bahahaha  They make more money being the opposing party....sooooo...  That s why they are consistently one of the  if not the highest  rated cable news stations   removed    mass voter fraud  theres always some fraud  Still pushing this absolutely absued notion at this point just makes all conservatives look like fringe loonies  Wee bit too late for that.  No.   removed   If you have a shred of real evidence I  39 m sure there are a lot of parties that would pay you great sums of money to reveal it. If you don  39 t  it  39 s time to move on.  Are you implying there was no fraud at all  I  39 m not speaking of enough fraud to change any outcome  I am speaking of any fraud.  What do you mean for fraud  Someone voted for his old father that could not make it  Maybe...   If it wasn  39 t enough to change the outcome then who gives a fuck     Ah yes  the classic  quot football games are comparable to elections quot  analogy  my favorite. Because elections are just  over  when the polls close. No need to count everything that continues to come in.  Browns were able to Stop The Steal ers   The Pittsburg Steelers victory have been certified by AP. Click  strong Here  strong  for more.  Official sources say that the stealers won the game  learn more about how you can protect football integrity here  Ha   This made me laugh.  Nice.  Bahahaha   My god that s Brian Kemp s music  breaking  football team comes back in the second half  other team stays on pitch for months after game is over still screaming that the other team cheated  Field....we call it a football field.  Oh dear... sounds like someone thinks the US is the whole world. In most other countries  a piece of land in which a sports game is played in is called a pitch. A rugby pitch  a football  proper football  pitch  a cricket pitch.  Considering the way the entire world obsess over every thing we do what else should we think.  Does the entire world obsess over everything you do  Or have you just believed all the propaganda that s been spoon fed to you since you were a child by the elites saying  America is the greatest country on earth  so you have no reason to second guess anything going on in the country  while also assuming since you re so obsessed with the US  so too must everyone else in the world  Or is it the fact that the US education system is so poor that children put through the system gain no understanding of the world around them  so they assume that everyone else thinks the same as they do  and is obsessed with everything their country does   Oh bugger off  Yes it is obviously just my imagination.  As every piece of social media is filled with half the world questioning everything happening in this country.  Does questioning what is going on in the country with the largest economy in the world  the largest military in the world  the country that has been at war for 222 out of the past 239 years  mean you are obsessed with it   I bloody know proper football is played on a bloody pitch. I was fortunate to go see Man U play when I was a teen.   Can you guys give it a rest  It had been known for months that Biden would get a majority of the mail in votes..  Yeah like that mail truck delivery to PA from NY. I  39 m sure those were a majority Biden  Just not 99  in the middle of the night.  If you really think this election was stolen  you are delusional. It is time to move on and focus or what the Republican Party really supports and not bolster conspiracy theories as to why the party lost  This.  Republicans have an extraordinary opportunity to appeal to the working class  preserve individual liberties  maximizing personal freedoms  and stop the growth of a too powerful federal government.  With democrats as far left as they are  republicans cam become the party of common sense.  I mean  that was already the goal and this is what decades of their efforts and strategies culminated in  soooooooo............  It  39 s a bit cringe we still feel this way.  You know what would be a great way to show that people are just being delusional  a simple vote audit.  i don  39 t understand why this is become the party line  it  39 s literally destructive to the republican party to throw around these total bullshit claims about election fraud. say it with me everyone  there was no mass fraud. it  39 s clear and obvious and there is overwhelming evidence that this was a safe election.  Why does this feel so familiar    removed   Lmao bro chill it s a fucking meme  Hmm I bet in 2016 you were the sore loser  Bro  chill  it was just a fucking joke lol  Ik I was responding to the dipshit who deleted their comment idk why I m getting downvoted  Lies  that shit popped up in my messages and I replied directly from there even lol  Oh so you made the bad joke  Wait  so now you were upset over the joke to the point you thought you had to explain it was a meme   Why did you make up that lie about a deleted comment that wasn  39 t deleted and is still the original comment of this thread    How are you trying to insult me when you  39 re admitting you can  39 t even keep straight who you  39 re responding to on a thread with you and that one other person    This just keeps getting weirder lol  This would be more like   quot the Steelers scored the points during the game but they weren  39 t allowed to be counted until the game was over quot   There was no voter fraud  Oh there was likely some  but not to the degree Trump or other buffoons claim.   Hilarious.    I feel you   I  39 m in the same boat and was about to make a similar comment.  Too many fake requests for admins to sift through it all in the recent few months I think so they  39 re playing it safe with flairing people. Even with this in mind some lefties have infiltrated and slipped through.  I absolutely understand   I just feel excluded from everywhere at the moment  Can  39 t seem to post any common sense response on anything in just about any other sub without getting brigaded. Got banned from  a href   r moderatepolitics  r moderatepolitics  a  for calling out some absolutely ridiculous arguments  they  39 re typically half decent but have gone full anti Trump mode lately. I  39 m not a Trump supporter  I  39 m not an American but if you make it   39 wrong  39  to be conservative or right leaning  you  39 re going to disenfranchise a LOT of people.  Oh boy youre not a fan of trump  youre in the wrong place bud.  As long as he is on the right side of the line he is exactly in the correct place.    Looking at the posts and the highly upvoted comments this sub is pretty far away from conservatism and I and everybody else knows it.  Then start posting about it instead of letting the MAGA crowd take it over.  I can  39 t. Not flaired.  Ive been lurking for a while but recently it just looks like a trump jerk off sub. Conservatism isnt half the nonsense that  39 s being posted here on a regular anymore.  We can  39 t control what the users post as mods.  The same thing happened when TD got shut down and we got an influx from there.  Things will even back out shortly.  Certainly hope so. Looking forward to getting a flair and struggling to bite my tongue at some of the nonsense.  Trump has achieved a lot of positive things in his term  and certainly trade and economic indicators  within his power to control  have been exceptionally good. I appreciated the way he didn  39 t  There are some things about him that I  39 m not overly fond of  predominantly his behavior and poor communication  Twitter  Really  .  Not a safe place. But  if a group of people are yelling during your lecture  you kick them out. Same here. Also we don t pretend to allow all ideas while not actually   em cough  em   a href   r politics  rel  nofollow  r politics  a   em cough  em   Note that although your comments may not be visible to the public in flair only threads  a mod may see and approve them  and they will be considered in a future application.  oh this is cool  thanks for letting us know  I was flaired barely a month ago. It s to prevent overt leftists from mucking up every thread. Just comment around and reply to stuff for a couple weeks and then send a nice message to the mods to request flair.  Thanks  it  39 s what I  39 m trying to do   just an extreme lack of non flair only posts  take a look for yourself and see    Oh yeah I know. My inbox was full of the  you commented on a post for flaired users only  messages for awhile lol  Ironic that a group advocating for free speech does not allow free speech  Free speech is not the intention of the sub   it  39 s a place for conservatives to discuss their varied conservative opinions on matters. I understand it  39 s a difficult concept for the left to grasp  where any slight straying from the  quot group think quot  requires you to screech NAZI at the person until they fall in line.  Not even american  so saying left right means nothing to me. My country is not as divided as yours. I  39 m just saying  i have read posts here about twitter censoring hate speech and terrorists  which apparently is not ok  but  a href   r conservative  rel  nofollow   r conservative  a  censoring difference of opinions is totally ok  Yeah it  39 s nice when they do that. There soooooo much censorship on this sub it  39 s almost as bad as twitter   are you serious   I remember being told that the mods can still see comments that were removed for not having flairs so you can still comment on flair only posts to build a history to get flared even if the comment is taken down.  Good to know.  Thanks   In the same boat as you. Gave Facebook and Twitter the flick on New Years Eve. Looked at my ban history on facebook and had spent over 7 months of 2020 banned  mainly for expressing conservative views  so little loss not being on there. Moved over to Parler then the assholes collaborated to shut that down. Glad to see Parler suing amazon. I think they have a real case  especially under the RICO law in the way Apple  Google and Amazon coordinated the takedown.  I  39 ve been staying off parler too.  I guess that explains why I  39 m not getting notifications anymore.  Nobody is. Google and Apple announced they were removing them for their app stores and within an hour Amazon announced they were removing them from their servers. Apparently gaining 20 million users in a couple of months must have really scared Twitter.  That  39 s just crazy.  Doesn  39 t seem like it  39 s legal.  I get having a better product and so you beat to completion but this is maliciously putting another business out of.... business.  It sucks but there are so many brigadiers that it is easier to auto block unflaired messages I guess.  What sucks is as a user you really have no recourse.  I got banned from Republicans not for breaking any rule but simply because the mod who was replying to my posts didn  39 t like what I said.  I reported them and had screen shots and everything but my reply said there is nothing they can do but thanks for letting them know.  Oh well.  Wear your ban as a medal. Proudly display it and expose those who deem themselves as  morally correct  for the weak minded filth they really are.  You know what  Yeah  extremists suck ass.  My error was two fold.  I didn  39 t condemn Trump  kick him to the curb  and say he was worse than hitler   satan and I also reminded them that hate speech is protected in the constitution.  I condemned the rioters and all violence a few times but it wasn  39 t enough.  I replied to the moderator saying I thought we were having a good discussion and what rule did I break   The reply I got was NO TERRORIST OR INSURRECTION SYMPATHISERS ALLOWED   I went to reply but have a 3 day band from replying to the mod.  LOL   So crazy.  No big loss there. Since Jan 6  a href   r republicans  rel  nofollow  r republicans  a  has been overrun with liberals. Won  39 t be long before they poison that sub reddit and turn it into another  a href   r politics  rel  nofollow  r politics  a . I like how this sub reddit has only flaired users policy. Keeps the liberal trolls away. I am new here and don  39 t have flair but I don  39 t mind waiting to get it. It seems to be a process that works very effectively in combatting the scourge of liberalism.  Amen  i can understand that for sure. if it makes the quality better it  39 s worth it  even if it makes it harder for people to join. that  39 s a lot better than having no real sub to discuss in or join in the first place  It cause the left will do coordinated attacks on pages like this and make fake post as fake conservatives and try to get this page banned so they have free reign to the media and only outputting their propaganda to heard more sheep and use social pressure to amass dumb followers.. peer pressure  people never learn. I lack the flair as well lol.   You know that admins can see who posts right  At no point in the history of reddit have the admins banned a subreddit because brigaders posted rule violating content  Have you ever seen any proof of this   Sometimes in football  a touchdown is scored with 0 seconds on the clock if the last play starts before the final clock expires. Votes were cast in the allotted time  so the result  Biden wins  BY A LOT  stands and anyone who thinks this is wrong doesn t understand the rules of the game or is being lied to by people who do.  How about a tank of copeium   Oh wow I was unaware that legal votes become illegal votes like Cinderella at midnight.   Stealers.  Why is this the worst place for censorship   We fully support free speech here. Censorship is what liberals resort to  not conservatives. You just need to go through an application   vetting process to unlock free speech in this subreddit. We just need to make sure you  39 re a conservative before allowing your posts to be visible here  that  39 s all.  You almost had me there lol.  Denial  Now that  39 s funny shit  This is funny because of how butthurt losers can be.   quot The NFL checked over tape and numerous angles of video and determined that no evidence of foul play was observed.... over  64 Times... in court.... in SUPREME COURT. quot   That  39 s not how NFL games work  FB propaganda  in MY reddit   Browns have now been banned from the NFL  NBA  and NHL  for good measure.   deleted   Even  a href  https   en.m.wikipedia.org wiki National Basketball League  Australia  rel  nofollow  australian basketball  a  is banning them  That  39 s how you know they messed up  In America  the NBL is the National Baseball League  however I screwed up  mostly because it  39 s late where I am  I should have said the MLB  Major League Baseball . My fault for making an off the cuff comment.  the best part of the game was watching big ben stare into space contemplate his entire existence  This is funny  Why didnt they just play better smh they could have won  The points were mailed in  every point counts   Lmaooo  If only  Mad   Go Browns    Love it.  Stealing PA lives on.      Funny  LOL  During the game  we joked they were going to stop the clock and make a point dump for the Steelers. In fact  right after we said that  the streaming got interrupted and suspiciously picked up seconds later.  I ve been listening to conservative AM radio and they re scared shitless of being cut off the air  condemning the Capitol riot several times but while comparing it to statements made by democrats during BLM protests. Everything is controlled by money now and that s why Trump turned on his supporters and won t stick up for them because his brand is ruined now.  Are they going to change their name to the  quot Dominions quot  now   These are just low hanging fruit memes. I want something growing higher  Man  They must have hired the Gov of Georgia to  find  those votes   I saw  quot in the middle of the night quot  and immediately thought they up and left again.  Okay but I m a Steeler fan  and the team intros before the game even started didn t feature us at all. Only the browns. It just seemed like a set up from the beginning.  Steelers  good one    Funny as hell.  Steelers  aka. Stealers    that  39 s the Pennsylvania way.  I thought i was on  a href   r browns  rel  nofollow  r browns  a    gave me a heart attack  We got to have some fun around here to on occasion. Amd well lets be honest the Browns not tripping on their shoe laces coming out of the locker room is an achievement.  LOL  As a yinzer  I approve this.  hm sounds familiar   I don t even like football  but as a native Clevelander  this would have made me cry.       Based     that one is good    Raiders beat Browns  Chiefs  and Saints  HOW DARE YOU INSURRECTIONISTS DEMAND THE COUNT STAY THE SAME AS THE FINAL WHISTLE      I understand the  s but the people who were added to the no fly list had it  39 s coming. Regardless of what you stand for  you aren  39 t going to bust into the capitol without getting on some lists  provided you can be identified.
t3_kvfouq,Democrat Law Professor Trump Never Actually Called for Violence or a Riot,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvfouq/democrat_law_professor_trump_never_actually/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  rel  nofollow  https   discord.gg conservative  a   Same here  today  39 s meeting started off with my one coworker stating how Trump killed the officer in dc  and should be arrested. The rest of them all pretty much agreed.  They didn  39 t seem too upset when BLM killed a black police officer.  For that incident some actually said it was wrong  but defended the logic of the protests. Basically  the protests were justified  but murder was not. On the other hand  they believed that Trump was going to box people up and start reeducation camps too  and yet  I  39 m the nutty conservative who is too uneducated.  My black friend told me  quot we have to burn shit to make a change quot . Yet he denounces Trump supporters protesting our constitutional rights.     Voting is only a right if you  39 re not a conservative.   quot yet  I  39 m the nutty conservative who is too uneducated. quot   Liberals seemed OK with pasty white Antifa people burning down minority communities all summer. Thank God it started affecting Joe Biden s poll numbers or there could have been even more damage.  The power of those who control the press.   Is this a haiku   I love how no one seems to care about the unarmed vet who got killed either.   BeCAuSE ThEy ArE TErrOrISts  Or David Dorn.  My friend thought Trump had the nuclear codes and could just pull up a box and start randomly launching missiles from his bed or something  I had to sit through a few convos about how Trump was going to start a nuclear war with china and Russia  kill off lgbtq rights and people  how he was going to force feed people religious beliefs and my favorite was the conversation on how he is trying to kill people by spreading covid.  I m still waiting for the war with N Korea that CNN promised in 2016.  Yup.  And Trump is the first president in like a billion years that didn  39 t get us involved in a huge war.  He  39 s not a puppet  and was actually a pretty damn good leader for this country.  And the idiots saying this stuff think they are our moral and intellectual betters.  People are not very intelligent  on average.  We  39 re all fucked because of it.  What  39 s sad is that there  39 s never a moment of self reflection for these people. If you went to them now and point out that this stuff didn  39 t happen  they  39 ll make an excuse and say he tried and just failed  or deflect to the next story and hyperbolic statement.  quot He LITERALLY tried to incite a coup against the US Government  quot   I  39 m still shaking from Fishgate  Ice cream gate  salt shaker gate ....  Yeah I ve heard a lot of that for the last four years. I keep asking when he s going to do al of this when he s had four years....they don t like that question.  I once told my coworker to stop referring to him as Hitler...why because Hitler was a really evil person and when you call Trump as evil as Hitler...well it makes Hitler look less evil. Their response was something about train cars  future camps and minorities being caged up already....at that point I walked away.  They distort the whole illegals being separated from their parents thing SO much.  The MSM does a GREAT job of making that whole thing look horrid.  First GOP president to openly support gay rights is totally going to kill off LGBTQ people LOL.  Might be a good time to point out that Trump did more for gay rights in the military and otherwise  than any Democrat.  He also launched a campaign to end the criminalization of homosexuality.  In some Muslim countries they hang gay people or there them off buildings.  I spent an hour this morning getting called the paranoid one by someone from this crowd for saying that social media sites should either remain as free platforms or be charged for all the violent shit on their sites as publishers. Yeah  I m the conspiracy theorist.  Someone pm d me saying that they re impeaching him because he might try and use nukes. Even if he had them he s not stupid enough to launch them  because if one countries nukes are launched  the rest of the worlds nukes are launched  and we don t want that  The times I have to tell people when they lament about trump and nuclear codes  i just laugh and tell them that  39 s not how it works and then they look at me like a dog that just heard a weird sound.  I don t understand how anyone thinks he did. I was watching his speech  or whatever you want to call it  when he basically said that after they were done at the White House  they were going to March down to the Capitol and make their voices heard. He was even going to join in. How anyone twisted it into that he said go down there and raise hell is beyond me.  Whats more crazy is they say he incited the capital building riot  but Trump finished his  a href  https   www.washingtonpost.com nation interactive 2021 capitol insurrection visual timeline   speech at the ellipse at 1 10 Pm  a  and the rioters started forming at the Capital building around 12 30 and started busting down barriers at 1 00PM before the speech was even over.   Trump supporters would have been at the speech.  Tell them you will give any of them  100 to find the quote in his speech that called for violence.  You can quote Kamala Harris who said  quot Beware   the protestors  will not let up  and they should not let up. quot   No you won  39 t win.    quot Silence   violence quot .  Best idea ever right here.  My in laws and a bunch of people I work with think he did too.  Fools are listening to every word of it and not even thinking for one second that the media hates Trump and will do anything to smear him until he is dead.  Probably even after that.  Weak minded people that do ZERO actual research on things believe this shit.  What you say doesn t matter  and never did.  What matters is what people  em felt  em  like you said.  Their logic  and anti Trump conservatives are running with it  is that he  em intentionally  em  spread false conspiracy theories about the fraud  thus he was directly responsible for the violence.  and there was no evidence of fraud ANYWHERE  too.  It never existed  and this was the most secure election in the history of the country   All you have to do is look at the video and transcript. This isn  39 t a debate about what you  em think  em  happened  it  39 s right there on video  He never called for it   These people can t be axed to look at video evidence.  Why do you think they pushed so hard to NOT audit   It  39 s funny because the only people who know more than me  a person who watched the speech  about his speech are leftists who would never watch a Trump speech  amp  absolutely wouldn  39 t just be going off of what they were told second hand by the people who control the narrative.  No  they think for themselves. They told me so.  The problem is  no one is looking at his speeches. They  39 re looking at the edited and revised CNN edition of his speeches.  A teacher at my old high school claimed that trumps 4th of July speech was the most divisive speech he had ever heard. Ass hat thinks Biden is the great unifier though.  He literally called for a  quot peaceful and patriotic quot  protest at the capital  but than again I  39 m sure he was  quot dog whistling quot  but clearly and blatently calling for peaceful protests.  Did someone say transcript   I ve had so many conversations with people who are blinded by their hate for trump  and can t even say why except  he s racist   that they refuse to believe anything other than what CNN feeds them.  Even if You show them FACTS like how he never actually incited anything   they refuse to believe it.  And completely ignore the hypocrisy from the left  That s because pelosi is a lying piece of   poop   He called the shit  poop     Don  39 t put it out with your boots  Ted   Don t tell me my business  devil woman   She is also insane.  And a raging alcoholic  And attempting to pull a military coup.  Exactly.  Sounds seditious... how do we report this man to the Thought Police   Let his kids do it. That  39 s their job now.  Ahhh yes....the good ol  39  hitler youth program.  I was thinking more of the Ministry of Unity now telling kids to tattle  1984  style  I was looking at what what really did happen  I understand GO did write about it  but hitler youth  Stalins youth  neighbors  etc. Would report neighbors and family to the SS or KGB for party dissent. Scary times.  All is good  but overall  both are scary enough.  Agreed. Agreed.  Yikes. Guess that s the end of his career.  I ve explained this to my friends on the left that he never explicitly said go storm the Capitol. We didn t send Bernie Sanders packing after a shooter showed up at a congressional softball game. Or when Al Sharpton led a riot in Crown Heights. But now that the fringe right did this  you better believe Republicans will have a hard time regaining any power any time soon. We ve literally shot ourselves in the foot.    quot In my view  impeaching on the speech alone would raise serious concerns over the use of impeachment in the future. Many Democrats  including members of Congress  refused to accept Trump as the legitimate president when he was elected and refused to do so as rioting broke out at the inauguration.  Many of the same members have used the same type of rhetoric to   39 take back the country  39  and   39 fight for the country.  39    Biden literally stated in a speech that he would have supported impeaching Trump again 6 months ago because he doesn  39 t like him. Straight up. He hates his guts  thus impeachment was legitimate. This is the new President of the United States that moderates helped to install because  quot Trump is too outrageous. quot   I ve watched his speech several times because people keep saying he incited the riot. I watched the edited and full versions. All he did was encourage people to march down Capitol Hill  no mention of violence if any kind. I also looked to see if he violated any Terms of Service on Twitter  and he hasn t. They blocked him incase he does.   The rioters acted of their own free will  it wasn t encouraged by Trump. I don t think Trump helped end it as soon as he could have though.  Have you never been to a large demonstration  Have you never witnessed all of the planning and crowd control that goes into a demonstration beforehand  It  39 s not a good idea  ever  to make last minute changes at a big rally like that  in DC  it  39 s typically illegal   especially after having a long speech by someone on stage talking about not being weak  and especially after you  39 ve said that the people inside the building you say you want to march to are enemies of the people.  Maxine Waters did.  Remember   Did Trump explicitly call for violence  Absolutely not.  He gone. Next to be canceled  So... This professor  39 s about to be unpersoned.  So I very carefully went rolling around in some of the news subs and found spots to ask them about this exact issue. The best answer was that Trump s election claims fueled the situation and incited violence by winding folks up basically. I mean  I don t disagree that his elections claims contributed but I don t think that alone caused anything. Point is that no one was willing or able to give me a substantive answer.   It would be similar to blaming the congressional base ball shooter on Bernie. Bernie spun him up on the evil Republicans blocking free healthcare and how if Republicans repealed Obamacare 9 11X10 people would die every year from it. Which is infinitely more radicalizing than what Trump has stated in regards to fraud.  I think Turley is one of the most reasonable voices from the left that there is. He respects the constitution and always cautions against quick decisions that create precedents that will tear America down. He  39 s a perfect example of what political discourse in America should look like   reasonable and fairly willing to agree with the other side and always placing the needs of the country above his own political agenda   removed   This is what I  39 ve been trying to tell people.  No one listens. They  39 ve all been brainwashed by the MSM.  100   Yeah   quot take back our country quot  is the type of rhetoric you hear all the time.  Anyone post this on  a href   r politics  r politics  a  yet   This poor man is going to get cancelled by his own party.  Yeah.. If you do the incredibly hard task of watching the fucking speech  its easy to tell  Former Democrat Law Professor...  Yup  he  39 s automatically a Nazi for speaking against the ministry of truth.  Of course he didn t. Those people were going to do what they did regardless of what he would have said. They drove too damn far from all over to not do what they already committed to doing.
t3_kvaf2k,Parler sues Amazon for suspending app from cloud service claims antitrust violation and breach of contract,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvaf2k/parler_sues_amazon_for_suspending_app_from_cloud/,This had better go to the Supreme Court   because Big Tech thinks the House  Senate  and Presidency will all look the other way when they abuse their power.  This isn t going to make it past the pretrial stages and will be booted with a 12b6 motion by the defense.   I don  39 t think this will be denied for failure to state a claim.  The claim of breach of contract should be enough.  They  39 d have a case against Google if Google plus didn  39 t fail horribly.  Everyone signs a contract to use AWS. This is a non issue as far as the courts are concerned  But it is very reasonable for any user company to expect some advance warning about being shut down so that they can do something about it.   That  39 s an incredibly good argument.  You are probably right that my example was a bit over the top. But in the end  Amazon is going to do what they think is best for them  or maybe in this case  what they feel like doing  as long as they think they can get away with it.  Not at all but I suspect the Democrats aren t going to mess with big tech. The two groups have a symbiotic relationship.  There  39 s MAYBE one democrat preventing them from packing the supreme court with however many activist justices they want. And that  39 s a big MAYBE.  If and when that is out of the way  and they kill the filabuster  the supreme court will just push through whatever legislation the democrats want. Hell they were basically already doing it before ACB was put on the bench.  Doesn t the court filibuster require super majorities  The next four years will suck  but I have faith we will resist as hard as they did  Ive lost faith that a lot of these  republicans  wont fold like a wet napkin in the next few months.  That s true  I ve been libertarian since Ron Paul  my stance has always been tear it all down. Hopefully we can vote out the RINOs and reshape the party at the very least  I think they can use the nuclear option  to change any rules on filibusters or anything else  to just a simple majority.  Simple majority can end it. Democrats used the nuclear option under Reid to end it for lower court appointments. Republicans decided they no loner trusted the Democrats on court appointments and removed it for SCOTUS. Democrats mocked outrage  though everyone knows that had Democrats had the Senate in 2016 when Scalia died the fillibuster would have been gone. They only limited their  quot nuke quot  due to no reason to expand it.  They clearly were not  as McConnel removed the filibuster for court appointments as soon as the left started blocking them.  If adding seats to the Supreme Court came to a vote today it  39 d probably end up short by  20 votes in the senate. You have to remember that most Democrats in the senate are older moderate centrists  and many of them are in somewhat vulnerable seats. Leftist populists who support moves like that make up a minority of the party  for now.  Hopefully if they try the Supreme Court will figure something out and stop it. remember FDR failed it expand it. If not they better stop the exploitation of the electoral collage cause by the dems  SCOTUS could slow walk it past the next election or rule packing is unconstitutional  the way the Dems just did it  on some technicality.  That  39 s like having two Popes. Doesn  39 t work out well.   The Democrats have a deal with big tech   They don  39 t  em think  em  the legislative and executive branches will look the other way. They know it  because it  39 s dead on the money.  And so far  they re right  No standing for antitrust   AWS only has a 32  market share  with Azure and GCP not too far behind. It  39 s not like they  39 re serving 4K video all the time either   any moderately sized cloud platform could support them. As for breach of contract  I don  39 t know the details but I could see them just paying them off.   quot I  39 m not truly a monopoly quot  is not a defense to an anti trust charge.   How is it  quot transparently collusive quot   Just because every upscale bar in New York refuses to serve me because I  39 m wearing flip flops does not mean they colluded to do so.  The timing. Parler has existed in the spotlight for months  and is only being singled out as  quot dangerously in violation of policy quot  now that the President is a  quot social media free agent quot . Coincidence   I don  39 t think you  39 ve been on the app stores for any of these services.  quot Standards quot  isn  39 t really a word I would apply to them.  They were already caught out in Senate hearings as coordinating such practices amongst one another.   As for breach of contract  their contract with Amazon likely has some promoting illegal activities clause in it. They will argue that Trump supporters used Parler to plan the Capitol riot. If Amazon gets it to the right court for them  that could work.   Oh yeah. Now we are talking.   Get the worst slime bucket dirtbag lawyers on the planet on this cause Amazon is a big fat rich target  Lin Wood  Isn  39 t he busy fight fifth dimensional alien vampires or something   That sounds like an amazing 90 s Marvel cartoon.  Nah sounds more like an Alex Jones episode. INTERDIMENSIONAL TIME TRAVELING PSYCHIC PEDOPHILE VAMPIRES   What is this  a crossover episode   Sprinkle some porn in just to make it a bit more interesting.  That nutjob  No one would take it seriously.  It was a joke  No.  Keep him   Powell  and Giuliani away from this stuff.  I d sure rather see someone with recent success . . .  For a great laugh  scroll down to the comment section... so many angry leftists.  Man  you weren t kidding   Reading their angry comments have become my newest form of entertainment  Do they have a chance to win  If they broke the 30 day warning period then they are probably going to get some sort of compensation from Amazon. Ifk if an antitrust lawsuit will work but I think it would be extremely easy on their part to find massive amounts of posts on other sites that break the terms of service to show they are being singled out  What you  39 re forgetting however is that Parler is protected under section 230....  It s not a gotcha that they are protected under 230  they are performing in accordance with it by not curating content   it s the other big guys who aren t  and who thusly shouldn t be afforded the protections .  Wouldn t a lawsuit against google and Apple be more sure fire because the stated reason for removing Parler was because they had posts that incited violence  yet Twitter has the same issue and is still allowed   Amazon is a sorta competitor to Google in this space. Amazon has their web hosting  but so does google. Sorta.   Lmfao that would be hilarious if they argued that  That  39 s... actually a really good point  On the contract it depends on the terms of the contract. I  39 m willing to bet that Amazon has their service agreements so one sided they can probably do anything they want. The more important issue will be the anti trust  in which these big companies conspired to kill off a competing platform. Unless they have some very specific examples of violations of their terms of service other than  quot we just don  39 t like you quot . The anti trust thing seems pretty obvious but the devil is in the details.  One type of challenge that can be made is  quot did the other party fulfill the interpretation of this clause  quot   but another is  quot is this clause a valid one under current law  quot .  Yeah  you cut to the core of it. A lot of people think that agreeing to something binds you to it  but that isn t how the law works. Both parties could have super double pinky promised to uphold the terms of the contract to the letter and when the deal goes sideways  they can still unleash the lawyers and potentially get out of it.  I work with AWS and Azure  the contract for accounts that qualify for a TAM are pretty standard for the old managed hosting industry.  For larger companies like Fortune 500 that would have AWS managed guys directly involved it would be even more in their favor as they would likely have dedicated hosts if not racks.     Is Twitville a platform or a publisher    deleted   Waht  Take them to the cleaners.  More likely Amazon will drain Parler through long and costly legal proceedings.  Parler vs Amazon will be one for the textbooks  This may have to go all the way to the SCOTUS and I don t like our chances.  That s why President Trump was pushing to modify section 230  The Democrats largely promised to stuff the Supreme Court the instant they could. And now they can.  Manchin said he won t pack the courts. Here s hoping he comes through.  And he is one man  which is very easy to buy off. Expect his nephew to land a ten million dollar contract and he will suddenly have a best seller book that will fly off the shelves selling 3 million copies.  Very concerned you are correct  He should have done what Obama did.  Set up a lawsuit against the government then order the government lawyers to throw the case resulting in a  quot settlement quot  where millions of taxpayer dollars went to political groups.  The same tactic that state governors used to change election law. Call up his buddies  have them sue the state to change election law  immediately settle.  I don  39 t think it  39 s going to end up going well for Amazon. Even if they fend off Parler  they are walking a very tight rope with anti trust with AWS  and I don  39 t think they will come out particularly well from an increased scrutiny of one company hosting 50  of American internet sites.  Unfortunately  Amazon now is so massive they just don t care. It would take a act of congress to do something and we all know thats not going to happen now  at least anytime soon. Even if ordered to pay Parler  1B do you think they care  Business as usual for them.  Why can  39 t it happen  There are many progressive Democrats who absolutely want to break up big tech.  Do they still want to   I really hope so.  I haven  39 t used amazon since 2017 and did pull the dramatic  quot I  39 m not supporting a monopoly quot  drama and you know what   It  39 s not heroic because it  39 s so easy   So many stores have great ecommerce sites nowadays.    I hope they can get a fuck load of money from this.  Although money does not win cases  it helps. I m not sure how things will go fighting an opponent that prints money.  Good  Amazon should be sued  and should pay heavily.  America is now ruled by four billionaires....and half the country is ok with that. Scary stuff.  Good for them.  They should have sought an injunction before they were taken down.  Time to TRUST BUST these monopolies  So can a platform be held accountable for the content therein  or not  Seems big tech wants to have their cake and eat it too.  Sue the balls off them.  Looks like Parler has some solid legal ground. This will be interesting to watch   Called it   Godspeed.

Trump forgot because he never opens his bible either.   We all know Trumps no Christian.  I  39 ve been saying this to all of my evangelical friends  I  39 m Christian too   but they practically worship Trump. He  39 s seriously just a step below Mary to them.  He s quite a step above Mary to most evangelicals I ve talked to  but s that s mostly just about them being against Mary  Christians aren  39 t against Mary  they  39 re just against how Catholics practically deify her.  a matter of degree if you are talking about   39 images and icons  39   Shit  I would ve hid them in the election fraud evidence vault. That things gonna be sealed for a long time and no ones going in there.  The Bible would burn her fingers the second she d touch it  I probably laughed at this harder than I should of  No more oaths of office.  Would she really have to check to see that it  39 s 0000000   Huh. All this time I thought it was 12345.   quot Guest quot   Should have put them in a mini constitution  no dem would ever find them  And most Republicans too  by the looks of it  Even better.  The Dems all have the New International Version that has the right to abortion where the 2nd amendment is supposed to be.  Her eyes then went to the big Bible on Trump  39 s desk.  quot No... you wouldn  39 t  MY GREATEST WEAKNESS    NOOOOO  quot  She tried to open the Bible but was severely burned and quickly disapparated.  quot I  39 ll get you one day  Trump    quot    a href  https   imgur.com gallery 2JgzMfG  https   imgur.com gallery 2JgzMfG  a   Does Pence have access to the nuclear codes   Because this would have made a lot more sense with his name instead of Trump s.

t3_kvh1is,Parler finds refuge with rightleaning webhosting service,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvh1is/parler_finds_refuge_with_rightleaning_webhosting/,And the free market solves another problem. When there s money to be made  someone will step up.  Just wait until mastercard  visa  and the banks blacklist epik.  This is the shit that will get out of hand. What  39 s next  Chase and BoA kick out Republicans  Where does it end.  Democrat coin  is that like Monopoly money   Worse. Fake plastic coins from the dollar tree.  I would be down with chocolate money  Who robs a dollar tree   It  39 s regular money  just stolen  No Venezuelan Bolivar  Banks love money  they want to start that shit  they will be relying on dorks who sit on the internet all day till mommy calls them for dinner  So basically half this sub.  it  39 s a pandemic  george  They already do it for guns.  Well my wife and I will take our 300k year out of BoA  close out our 300k home loan with them  and get both our employers  conservative businesses that gross a combined 30 million a year  to do the same.  We  39 re both high enough up and influential enough to make a dent  Make sure you let them know why  That s great but 30.3 mil is nothing to BoA. And you re a huge outlier.  It is to the branch that houses those accounts.  That  39 s only one small grouping of people.  We  39 re not alone.  Not true. A  30 million withdrawal will make it to the CEO  39 s desk.  A  30 mil withdraw for one of the largest banks in the worlds happens every single day if not hour. It s not noteworthy.  A withdrawal is entirely different from an account being shut down and transferred to another institution. I worked as a personal banker for years. 30 million walking out the door will absolutely grab attention from CEOs  They may have billions daily in traffic  but a single  30 mil withdrawal will definitely raise an eyebrow  and result in a phone call.  The fact that you believe that shows just how little you know about the banking world.  B OF A is also anti gun.  I  39 m currently making preparations for serious life and finance shifts as well. Nomad capitalists will leave in droves if sufficiently provoked.   39 Tread lightly  39  is not some isolated proverb  the left will find out how many are preaching what they practice.  In my experience  a Democrat and their money are soon parted.  This has been happening for a while now. David Horowitz was blacklisted by Visa and Mastercard for being critical of Islam.  If that happens  take your money out of those banks.  Time to roll into crypto.  I remember bitcoin at  238 when I first read about it in the print version of mental floss..  now 40k   it  39 s not them I  39 m worried about it  39 s the IRS.  Lest we not forget what happened the last time these fucks were in office.  Or the rest of the internet blacklists Epik and cuts them off the network  Then that leaves room for a Republican to start their own service and take 45  percent of those markets. Maybe I need to get into the financial world...  Other banks and credit cards will pop up that want our money more than they want to virtue signal to the far left.  They  39 re showing us who to boycott  at least.  Cloudflare is another one that  39 s pulled shenanigans before.  It s all good. We have crypto now  They ll ha e to switch to bitcoin lol  Who says capitalism doesn t work   The web host is called Epik  incase anyone wants to take their services there.  They are going to need all the funding they can get.  They re about to get rich  as long as they keep their nose clean.  You know what  they can do all the cocaine they want if they support free speech.  Imagine if Republicans became the party of freedom and democrats became the party of control.  Yea. Imagine.  It  39 s easy if you try  I fucking hate that song.   quot nothing to live or die for.... quot   Me too. It  39 s basically the Globalist National Anthem and I can  39 t stand it  Will look inti it and if legit will switch.  I looked at the pricing of their dedicated servers and they were super expensive. If I would be building a new service  I would straight out think foreign providers...  This isn  39 t done yet. There are still ISP  39 s to refuse service and banks.  ISPs  DNS services  email  payment services  investors... of course there s still more  but eventually the far left will start harassing another company they feel is an easier more vulnerable target.  They do tend to lose interest in individual targets  with one notable exception  rather quickly. Then again  I can t help but feel we re entering a new age so to speak.  Hell yes  This is what I  39 m talking about.  Despite that the left has Corporations  Universities  Hollywood  Mainstream Media  Globalists  China  Sporting leagues  and Big Tech to carry their water they can barely compete with us   Oh  and how to raise your children on puberty blockers.  A 15 year old kid who I tutored came out to me as trans... I feel so bad for him.  then why are they winning  Good  they should be allowed to provide their services. That being said I will keep using Gab.  Is Gab any good  How many people are on it   Well it doesn t work right now because so many people are trying to join haha. But overall I like it and hopefully they get the servers settled down.  Yeah it takes forever just to open the page and I can never get anything more to load once I scroll down.  I  39 m talking about just an .apk file direct from their website.  They do have an app  just scroll down and select gab apps.  Its right at the bottom of the webpage along with privacy policy etc    I hate the segregated society the left is creating yet I see no other way to fight back than supporting other companies  Right Leaning....   Conservatives have been mocked  harassed and shot at for twelve years so pardon me if I don t have sympathy for the left.  As expected.  Question is who is going to trust them with anything after what just happened with the hack.  I will continue to use it  however my account was not verified. I will never use any service that requires that kind of information because of ... well exactly what happened.  What hack  Hack of Parler or the new server host    a href  https   www.reddit.com r Conservative comments kv34ok 70tb of parler users data leaked by security   https   www.reddit.com r Conservative comments kv34ok 70tb of parler users data leaked by security   a   Wow  and she called herself crash override  that  39 s pretty funny... not for Parler users though. So there are woke hackers now  the world just got worse.  There have been woke hackers as long as there have been hackers.  You  39 re probably right. This information she has taken though is raw and contains personal info like location  I think she should be arrested if she shares any of this publicly as it could endanger people. Hopefully the EU data protection people will go after her.  She  39 s not a hacker  she  39 s  a security researcher           Still could be a high bar for Parler to get back up and running.  Depending how they were deployed on AWS  the differences in stack  or at least how it was orchestrated and deployed could differ and require significant work to change.  Uh oh  a href   r technology  r technology  a  isn  39 t going to be happy  It s so weird to me that parlor got targeted so much. Sure there were some lowlifes on there but mostly it was fine  It was an attempt to continue to stifle the President.  I cant believe even our web hosting services need to be political. Wtf has happened to our country   liberals happened.  You mean a webhost committed to freedom.  Ayeeeeee  fantastic news   Is Parler back up  It didn t work a few minutes ago.  will be several days  maybe a week before they are functional again.  For anyone who didn  39 t hear the ceo on Beck  39 s show... the funny part is they aren  39 t even against taking down content  they just want to do it the old way of a person deciding instead of the stupid algorithms that twitter uses.  They will bring the fight to your door.  See told you guys it would be fine. Don  39 t be crybabies like leftists  If you think we are fine and in the clear  you are going to be surprised. Credit card companies and banks could drop them along with payment processors. We have a major problem and to blow it off is silly and dangerous.  This will end with them and any company that works with them getting blacklisted by the credit card processors.  That  39 s how markets work as long as consumers have a plethora of choices.  I believe that as long as individual and businesses customers have a plethora of choices when trying to buy a service or product  I don  39 t see the reason for the government to step in.  I think Hostgator just lost me as a customer.  Do they use AWS or something   Unfortunately it doesn  39 t look like they offer any VPS service similar to EC2. Only dedicated servers and shared hosting.  When they get getting called right leaning the go to response should be actually we are   39 non political  39   Did AWS let them get their data.  I assume they had back ups.  Should be that hard to build out their own servers in a Colo somewhere.  Its also nice having a DR strategy that doesn  39 t rely on a single service provider.  Make DR and off site backs to 3rd location   Companies beware. The precedent has been set. AWS can and will terminate your hosting if they decide they don t like you.    In its lawsuit  Parler claimed that  without Amazon  39 s support   quot Parler is finished as it has no way to get online. quot  Parler also said that switching to a different service provider  like Epik  in order to host its platform would require significant changes to its website  which would cause the website to go offline for a  quot financially devastating period. quot

Freedom of opinion is an essential right of elementary significance.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv9fud/germanys_angela_merkel_twitter_ban_of_trump/,Twitter  Hi Angela Merkel  we have found that you are spreading misinformation and have decided to suspend your account.  Germany knows better than anyone  They don  39 t have much nostalgia for this one.  Mexico and now Germany...  And Australia and France.  Can you link what Australia and France have said   Not sure about France  but I  39 m pretty sure Australia said  quot Oi  c nt... What do you think you  39 re doing quot .  England reportedly said  U fookin wot m8  in response to Trumps Twitter ban.  Now do the Scottish   I bet we won  39 t understand a damn word.   a href  https   www.google.com amp s fortune.com 2021 01 11 problematic twitter merkel france trump amp   https   www.google.com amp s fortune.com 2021 01 11 problematic twitter merkel france trump amp   a   When even Germany is saying ya done fucked up  ya really done fucked up.  Especially if it  39 s Merkel saying it  Exactly.  Shit  Germany has restrictions on certain types of speech  agreed    strong Germany  strong   em saying there s a problem going on with free speech in the US  em    Actually Germany said that the government needed to step in and create laws curtailing speech instead of social media having to step in... it was there way of saying repeal the 1st amendment... I mean with merkels history it doesn t surprise me.  Yeah I was disappointed when I read more it s pretty misleading actually.  According to this article that s not quite what they said. They said the decision to ban someone should come from legal channels not the decision of a corporation. If it were to ban someone it should be the government. They weren t necessarily saying they  em had  em  to.  what world do we live anymore lol  CNN   em breaking news  German chancellor admits she  39 s a racist and a bigot  em    Nazi  omg  she said something I agree with  When the Globalists call leftists out for overreaching you know it  39 s really egregious. ACLU too.  Clown libs are ruining the long game.  They  39 re making it too obvious and giving us a fighting chance by going too far too fast.  Yo if Germany is calling you out for attacks on freedom you really fucked up..  Where are these stupid little libs who spent half the day yesterday trying to convince me that twitter banning Trump has nothing to do with free speech  Big tech is  em clearly  em  in bed with leftist politicians  and now they  39 re doing their bidding.    Like if a cop TELLS someone to do something like go into a house and conduct a search that would be illegal for him  the search is still illegal.    Leftists acting more and more like Nazi Germany everyday  getting called out by the country itself...  Even the   39 democratic socialists  39  are worried about this one. We skipped the high taxes and middle class bankruptcy phases of the transition to socialism  and just skipped to absolute loyalty and support of The Party through fear and control.          The high taxes are coming  won t be long.  When German Hillary Clinton says you went to far.... you done went too far  She  39 s not German Hillary... She can actually get elected.  Jack Dorsey is a piece of shit  hellbent on destroying humanity.   I hope he gets his real soon.  Remove 230 protection  Class them as common carriers  like phone companies.  That really is what needs to be done. No one forces you to get a phone  no one forces you to get a social media platform. The phone company can  39 t prevent you from saying what you want over their lines  social media companies shouldn  39 t be able to prevent you from saying what you want on their platform.  This should have been the case for server companies  social media  communication apps  email services  etc. There s no way the Democrats will even consider repealing 230 or anything of the sort as long as they re in power and I have real doubts the Republicans would either though this situation ought to make them think they need to get serious.  Yeah  Germany has been down this road before. It  39 s called Nazi Germany...Hitler... quot cleansing quot ...any of that ring a bell liberals   If you  39 re ANTI FASCIST you can  39 t be a FASCIST. words be like that. It  39 s like North Korea people  39 s Democratic party. Usually socialist and Democrat mean somebody is getting thrown in a camp because of their ethnicity possible political alliances or wealth status  Violence is bad  unless we re doing it  You know you ve got problems when Merkel is the one with the Based takes...  Is it a based take or does she see their long con about to explode because American libs went full Leroy Jenkins   And yet again  another hilarious example of someone reddit immediately turned on  You know you are crossing the line if Angela Merkel calls you out for freedom of speech violations.  This is just great. We ve got the freakin Germans lecturing us about liberty  Sheesh  Lol even the birth country of Nazism says leftist are batshit.  Germany is lecturing the US on free speech now. That s how far we ve fallen in such a short time.  Okay if SHE S saying that we re really in trouble  Wow for once as an EU citizen I m glad this old witch is not saying something stupid or against us peasants  I m mortified that Germany is giving us free speech lessons.  And yet Merkel was recorded asking what Zuckerberg was going to do about Germans who were opposed to mass immigration into Germany.  Maybe when the Germans are saying that you  39 re starting to look a bit Fascist you should listen. Unfortunately I doubt the left will listen.p   em Merkel  em  of all people  sheesh everyone is doing a 180  I haven  39 t seen anyone mention that Trump directly attacked the same tech companies that banded him for the next crazy thing. To me this seems like the motivation to remove him more than what he said. All sorts of people tweet  from the Arab spring tweets that changed several countries to hateful teenagers venting to the world. But they are not banned because they don  39 t threaten the profits of twitter.  How long until Twitter bans Angela Merkel     Damn... so she WAS a NAZI all this time.  All the lefties who have been calling Merkel the Leader of the Free World have left the chat  Maybe Trump could hold a press conference if he want to say something  Liberals in 2018   quot Yass Queen Merkel  Slay that Orange shit  quot   em snaps both fingers in applause  em .   Am I in the twilight zone   Chances are this has less to do with freedom of Speech and more to do with the amount of power American tech companies have.  Very true. The EU ultimately would like some global internet law. Their problem with recent events isn t with the idea of suppressing speech itself  but the idea that a corporation   rather than a government   is the one calling the shots.  Maybe I  39 m naive but I think the majority agree with us. It doesn  39 t help in that he  39 s still banned but it does feel a little better every time you hear or see someone agreeing.  Can  39 t you get imprisoned in Germany for  quot hate speach quot    What a bloodless statement.  She was born in East Germany.... nuff said.

Some people spend their whole day on what should be restricted to time on the toilet.  I signed up for Reddit years ago to get help and help others in a niche subreddit.  That is what Reddit should be for  not what it turned into.  Same here.  Signed up 4 years ago to get help on a Dell computer  and somehow ended up in  a href   r politics   r politics  a .  Got downvoted to hell and magically whisked to this sub.   I don  39 t think my computer question was ever answered    Reddit is the most toxic and hateful site I thin I ve ever been apart of  I want this website to dissappear forever and I  39 d be 100  OK with that.  I got a bunch of death threats a couple days ago for posting in this sub. I had to turn off my messaging  lol  Well  they obviously hate small business owners  so...  Someone asked me  quot What  39 s your business name and where are you located  quot  lol  They wanted to send some of their comrades over to your place.  Obviously  that  39 s why they don  39 t condemn blm when they riot and burn down hundreds of small businesses  The private messages many of us receive for posting here have...not been positive.  I love how you can be posting in another sub about the most random subject  r underwaterbasketweavingtips and randomly get a message  le orange man is bad    On the up side  the non flaired people that post in flaired only posts seem to have no idea we cant see their posts.  Yeah  Reddit can be trash  but only on certain topics. If you have certain interest you find some good and helpful ones.  The political subs are cancer  as are the news subs. Reddit is great at informing me about what PC components I should buy  or how I should invest money. Every time I read my DMs I steel myself for some vicious hate messages lol    I posted in  a href   r blacksmithing  r blacksmithing  a  about the origins of a 19th swedish anvil and instantly got back   quot oh  you post in  a href   r thedonald  r thedonald  a  you moron  hur dur orange man bad quot  from a random lurker.  Never had I ever thought about searching for the background of random participants in a discussion just to insult them off topic.  Who has time for that   I ve been off Twitter for years and just recently dumped Facebook back in early December along with Snapchat. I still use Reddit but I m damn close to getting off this platform as well  Is it possible to remove yourself completely from Facebook or Twitter  though   I  39 m not even sure you can do that  unfortunately.  This is 100  truth  Good  go right to zero.  Go low enough so Elon Musk buys you and publically fires Jack Dorsey.  Knowing Elon Musk  this isn  39 t out of the realm of possibility.  Papa Musk will save us all  Apple   than threatens to remove the app from the store after he removes moderation control.  His worth is 185B. Twitter is worth 38.32B right now. I don t know how much Musk has on hand mind you.   It had to be done   I would pay money to see this happen.  So should Elon.  Hope these employees lose all their wealth if they had stocks. And lose their jobs  Twitter is one company I could care less if they went out of business. Jack Dorsey is a PoS....  He has a shit ton of money  yet he can t afford a stylist. Every time I see him he looks like a hobo.  Yup I think he needs to be taken down a peg or 2.  I m sure they ll stand by their convictions once their options are worth  0  same  And below.  100  I really dont understand why twitter has any market value.  If anything proves that we are in a stock bubble  it is people willing to pay for a fully mature tech company with no room for growth that still has little revenue and no path to profitability.    This was probably inevitable even if they didn  39 t delete Trump  39 s account.  Social Media thrives on rage  and with Democrats soon to be in control of all three branches of government  the Democrat Media Complex now has to pretend everything is hunky dory.  Hard to monetize rage tweeting when you have to pretend Biden is the second coming of Washington.  What  39 s after Trump and the rest of us conservatives  Who will they go after  Will they finally be able to live in harmony in a racist  fascist  bigoted  nazi free zone .......  Thank you for your reply   Yes. I think the traditionally liberal core of the Democrat establishment has lost control of the wild leftists on their wings  and they  39 re going to be in for the fight of their lives going forward.  The establishment democrats are the Mensheviks. And the AOC types are the Bolsheviks.  They will attempt to target conservatives who are threats in the future. They did this with Sarah Palin after the 2008 election where they had super majorities and the presidency. The media dedicated large amounts of time slandering and attacking her as they feared she would run for president. Expect targeting of Cruz  Haley  Pence  and in other potential 2024 nominees.  I think this will determine if the democrats will treat all Republicans the same as Trump or if Trump was the anomaly with the amount of abuse he was getting. We need to see if they will start slandering the republican minority in both House and Senate.  Well the only move in their playbook is  quot  Current Republican Nominee  is so much worse than  Previous Republican Nominee President . quot   So assume the next candidate will also be deplatformed.  Have you not heard of  quot Bush Derangement Syndrome quot   It was used long before Trump started running in politics. Bush was  quot literally Hitler quot  and they burned effigies of him in numerous rallies and protests. He was a  quot stupid monkey quot   and  quot brain damaged quot  due to his speech patterns.  quot Bush Lied People Died quot    quot Bush went to war for oil  The Warmonger  quot   I  39 ve sort of heard about it. During that time I was in my own world in high school. I can only imagine that it  39 s worse now all because of the left leaning MSM and social media.  It wasn  39 t as magnified then because social media was still relatively new  but there were plenty of instances where W was referred to as Hitler as well.  Seems to be the go to for any Republican President.  Yup  it  39 s an irony that both mainstream media like CNN and MSNBC and social media both greatly benefited from Trump  while most conservative media probably would have done better if Hillary was elected.  I  39 m sure I  39 m not the only one who noticed that social media monetized Trump until the last possible second  then axed him.   quot Principled quot  indeed.  SJW  39 s will always find something to complain about. They  39 ll always be something they want to have canceled.  Let s see how far we can get this stock to tank  Gettest woketh  goest broketh  Who cares    Without Trump  who cares what people tweet    You ate lunch   What a surprise.  Twitter exists so you can demand people to accept the gender of your lunch.  underrated comment.  Keep pushing. Delete Twitter and make a Gab account.  Jack Dorsey looks like a tall dwarf  Woke Rasputin  Let  39 s dub him  quot Ori quot .  That  39 s an insult to hard working Dwarves everywhere.   Not enough. This fucking scumbag bugman billionaire literally gloated on his own platform about how other scumbag bugmen billionaires colluded to take down his fucking competition.  Not enough.  Gotta drop at least 50  before these communistas start to panic.  Yeah  12  is enough to get investors to buy the dip. Hard to know if this is a correction until they report their numbers.  Gee. Maybe it has something to do with their closed mindedness and no acceptance   I think the market realized that Twitter just killed their goose that lays golden eggs.  Yep.  Or the fact that their income is based off advertising and number of users....and Twitter  just killed their own income by getting rid of users.  Bad practice from a business aspect.  Agreed. Also does not help that I think some people are finally realizing that it is made up of morons.  They committed suicide. They knew what would happen if he was banned   everyone did. Twitter is a sacrificial pawn meant to normalize the suppression of opposition voices. Everyone followed suit after them.  Oh yeah. Major corporate suicide. Makes me glad I never got a Twitter account since it is shit.  No shit Dorsey  Who would have thought that would happen   You pretentious phuck  Dorsey doesn  39 t care  Twitter is worth billions. The only thing that would make him care is a rival to his monopoly like parler.  I just deactivated my account though I never really used it  This will not affect Twitter in the long run at all. You guys just witnessed the biggest most blatant anti trust violation that s ever happened. Twitter  Google  Amazon  Apple all came together and squashed Parler.  To be fair the federal government hasn  39 t done anything about corporate collusion in decades. Cell Phone carriers were abusing the shit out of collusion throughout the 00  39 s with no repercussions.  quot Hey I  39 m going to charge an outrageous .50 per text  quot   quot You know what  That sounds like a good idea  I will also charge .50 per text  even though it costs absolutely nothing quot .  quot Yeah  I know it would make it smart for me to undercut you guys and charge only .30 per text to scoop up your market share of cell phones  but I  39 m also going to charge .50 per text. It  39 s such a good number quot . They couldn  39 t have been any more blatant about it  and nothing happened to them.  Cable companies are doing it now with data  This company stock will probably sink so low they will sell out to another tech giant. This is no longer a viable company.   MySpace 2.0. If any tech company is going down  it s this one.  We have to demonstrate our will  amp  unity.   This must end.  these tech companies only go down when they get replaced. Unless there is a replacement  you won  39 t see  that happen.  Twitter is the only one that can be foresee ably replaced. All the others  not so much.  Imagine if people left Facebook en masse and went  em back  em  to MySpace  Full circle hahaha.  why the hell would you buy a twitter stock  It  39 s literally a digital playground for rich snobs to post their idiotic comments. People can do that on any real platform they want.  it was down 6 . this is considered a normal dip. I  39 ll make a friendly bet that people will see this and mistake it for a dip  bringing the stock price back to where it was in a week with no new news against it.  Good. I don t want to see a small slide  I want to see a massive one.  Get woke  go broke.  People keep posting these percentages like they mean anything. Even with these declines  it doesn t approach the lows of 2015 and 2016. This doesn t faze anything. You want to kill the platform  You need to deactivate you account and get someone else to do the same thing and then keep on going.  I would think it would be more  I mean he had over 88 million followers. I think a lot of people were on Twitter because of Trump   I know I was.  I sold my shares.  It was a decent performer for me but I can find better uses for that money.  It  39 s only a start. Twitter can fall 12  daily until it  39 s sold as a penny stock as far as I care.  Lot of nervous investors who see some big lawsuits coming.  LOL. I ll buy some Twitter stock once it s a penny stock after they re under new management.  Wonderful.  Good  They deserve to bottom out.   quot There are levels of survival we arw willing to accept. quot   Twitter needs to go the way of Tumblr.  I loved the Timcast where he massacred soybeard Dorsey like a total savage  for his offenses against free speech. Dorsey tried to have his fembot slave girl answer every question for him but they ended up looking like Douchebags LLC.  Let s bring it lower  Unhook yourselves from this trash  you ll live a better life for it.  Parents take it off your kinds  addiction boxes  Not enough  For the love of god make them go bankrupt. I would love nothing more than to see all of their employees with nowhere to go.  I dropped 25 followers before I deleted my account. The purge is great  STONKS     Epic gamer moment  Needs to outright crash.  Fuck this cancel culture bullshit.  Liberals are literally the modern equivalent of fascism and the Nazi Party.  They are everything our founding fathers warned us about.  Please keep falling     I am happy that I deleted my Twitter and Facebook today. Downloaded all my photo albums  told my friends they can reach my phone or on GAB then deleted. Feels good honestly.  Out of the big 5 they have the lowest revenue by a massive margin at 3 billion.  Just deleted my Twitter account that I haven t used in a year. I ll add to anything that makes that trash company suffer.  Fuck   39 em.  Leave Twitter now.  en masse.  It  39 s a cesspool of filth  and the company is worse.  Not enough  All the liberals gonna to buy it  they will want to prop it up     So when it tanks  when Sane America really goes after it  they will lose their investment in tyranny.
t3_kv34ok,70TB of Parler users data leaked by security researchers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv34ok/70tb_of_parler_users_data_leaked_by_security/,Does Twitter have a hacked information policy or not  Guess not anymore.  Apparently it  39 s ok to talk about hacked materials  so long as you don  39 t show proof  i.e. the actual documents.  They  39 re literally linking to the hacked material...  and it  39 s mirrored in a few places for extra transparency ...  Like tax reports   lol I see what you did there  Shitty part is people have to give them their social security number so a leak like this is not good at all  I never gave them that.  They have my phone number and email address  but so does FB and Twitter.  I think the big problem is that if you verified yourself as a real person  you had to take a picture of your ID  typically a driver  39 s license.  I never did that  but I bet a ton of others did.  I didn  39 t trust it.  Seems that was the appropriate call.  Yeah  I am kind of baffled by it. I never really saw SSN prompts or driver license prompts. I was curious to create an account months ago and pop my head around type of thing. I have done that a lot for up and coming social media platforms.  wow  and I thought a phone number was intrusive.  phone number was enough for me to nope the platform.  Facebook does that shit too  if your profile name comes into question or your profile gets reported too much for anything they just default to shutting you down til you provide an ID.  How ironic  when most don t need ID to vote  Instagram does that too  Same here.  I was going to sign up a few weeks ago and that stopped me dead in my tracks.  Thats what im concerned about  I was verified as a real person and I didn  39 t have to do that  How did the whole SSN rumor get started    I think it is required if you want a higher account like an  influencer  or something   but not just a regular account  It was a deliberate lie told by the Tech Fasc left and weirdo fanatics from rival platforms like GAB.  I read somewhere on reddit you have to verify yourself that way. Was on this sub somewhere. Can anyone shed some light   I read that too but it never happened to me. I never posted or anything though  I was on the site for like 5 mins.  I believe you needed to provide a pic of your ID to become a verified user  but you could use the site with just an email or phone number.  1   Your ID shouldn  39 t have your SSN on it.  What about your phone number   I dont think this is a thing  at least for people who are just creating accounts. I made a parlor account specifically looking for it to ask for my ssn  but it never did.  Yea i had a parler account and all they asked for was a phone number and email. The whole  quot they ask for id and your SIN number is just rumour bs started by rivals looking to suppress speech.  I joined and looked into it out of pure curiosity. First off   as long as you aren  39 t using a flagged IP address like a VPN  you won  39 t get the sms verification  so I was able to join by just using a cellular network with a fake phone number and only had to complete a 6 letter captcha.   Yea  i didint bother with the checkmark thing. I did it with my cell number for two step security to protect my account.  lol  next week in news. Entire mall labeled as terrorist organization mysteriously burned to the ground by mostly peaceful protestors.  Lmao so a repeat of this summers   39 peacefull protests  39 .  No app EVER should be asking for that.  Why would you even think they ask for that in the first place   Have you ever seen an app do that in your entire life   Why would researchers release the actual data instead of just white papering the exploit   Security Researchers sounds less threatening. They wouldn t accidentally leak something lol.  Security researchers is leftist speak for hackers  The right hacks the left researchers  This terminology isn  39 t a left and right thing.  Only when it  39 s an  quot acceptable target quot   Because the data is basically meaningless. Look what was written.   Yeah I  39 m calling bs on Parler being hacked  sounds like script kiddie shit  Agree  Lol this  i can imagine not a lot of people here are tech savvy but a web scraper is reality easy to build and can scrape public data on most websites. This wasn t some sort of data breach.  Because it was  as you say  scrapes save  em public  em  data  but these trash got access to  em private  em  data helped by information how to do so given by Twilio.   quot Ahhh whoops quot   Real security researchers don t do that because it s unethical. Activists and lefty shitstains do that because  revolution  nothing less  and their glorification infatuation with Marxism.  check her name.  a  quot researcher quot  indeed  They  39 re hacktivists  not researchers.  They want the data so they can report people to the FBI.  Except  they  39 re basically just going to report anyone because they are wholly intolerant of people with differing opinions.  In what admittedly small time I spent on Parler  nobody was talking about insurrections  violence  or any other illegal activity.  Most were basically just using it as a way to disseminate information.    No it won  39 t.  Parler  39 s lawyers dumped them too.  Thank god there are more than 1 lawyer in the world  They got a lawsuit filed against AWS today.  who is they  parler got a lawsuit filed against aws    a href  https   www.courtlistener.com docket 29095511 1 parler llc v amazon web services inc   https   www.courtlistener.com docket 29095511 1 parler llc v amazon web services inc   a   I can assure you that there are lawyers who want a piece of Twilio.  I don  39 t have the time to go to law school real quick and do it myself  but surely there  39 s a lawyer somewhere who is willing to take this on.  I  39 m sure a normal company can find a lawyer to represent them in this ridiculous case.  I am from a very litigious state and it  39 s BS to act like Parler can  39 t find a lawyer when I  39 ve seen  for example  a dude faking being disabled and suing lingerie stores for being handicap accessible  find a lawyer  Even if dumped  that  39 s still a legit cause for a lawsuit.  Believe me  there s always another lawyer when you pay your bills.  Oh boy. I brought this up a month or so ago  telling people that Parler asking for personal information such as a HOME PHONE NUMBER and or payment information was very questionable and that their database could get infiltrated.      Well  since many are unaware  the leaders behind Parler are the same people who created Cambridge Analytica. Anyone else surprised   I  39 m sure many online services do this.  I think several do. When I was deleting a service that I no longer used in the past I asked them to not only deactivate my account but also remove my data. They said they wouldn  39 t and after talking to a customer service person for a while they told me to just change all my personal  info  name  email  phone number  to something else before I deactivated.  This is the best course of action with anything online. I haven  39 t seen it in awhile  but occasionally you  39 ll come across comments on reddit where it states the user used some program service to overwrite all of their posts.  It s pretty common. Users accidentally delete stuff  then want it back. Ok fine we ll just flip the  deleted  flag.   Oh  THAT makes it perfectly okay then.  s  Yes.  Make sure that if you ever delete your reddit account that you use something like shreddit  or similar  that goes through and overwrites as much of your history as it can.  Won  39 t matter.  There are continuous archives being made daily of the entire comment database.  Anyone who was sufficiently motivated could roll the whole thing back to any given date.  I still use Nuke Reddit History periodically  though.  You should periodically start new accounts and lie about your life details.  Or better yet  concoct a consistent fake identity.  I have a whole fake narrative where I talk about being an old guy  living in a city  being married with kids  etc.  Or just don  39 t say anything relevant anyways    True.  But this way if you do let some truth slip out the signal to noise ratio is favorable.  By law they are required to do this for up to a year.  It  39 s just in case any kind of investigation has to be made against the person who deleted their account to hide criminal activity.  This is common because of future features like restoring posts and what not. As a dev  we often place flags that mark stuff as deleted instead of actually deleting it.. there are a bunch of reasons for it. I m always in favor of deleting things for the record  but sometimes there s reasons that we can t because of limitations in the way the software was developed or the way the infra is  You re a fool if you believe most web applications hard delete user data. It s all soft delete  They kept it  then they leaked it.  It  39 s really fucking sad that people are conditioned to think that  39 s hunky dory.  It  39 s NOT.  Fuck Parler.  Every online service does this. They store it as deleted. This is why you simply have to be careful about what you post in the first place.  Others do this as well.  Part of it is because you don  39 t want to accidentally delete things that weren  39 t supposed to be.  I can tell you this definitely happens in live environments.  Yeah that s really fucked up. That s our data  and if I want it deleted it should be gone. That marketing saying always rings true  if you ain t paying for it  you re the product.  Doxxing everyone who uses Parler just for being conservative is gross.  Thus where we are. I asked on a post on another sub what people will do once they ve gotten every conservative fired from their jobs  response I got was  live peaceful lives   I m permanently disabled  so I really have nothing to lose by voicing my opinion  Wait until you lose your disability.   removed   I work for a very conservative small independent company so I m good.   removed   I m in Texas  you think we would adhere to a lockdown   Abbot will tell them to fuck off  Have no idea but I imagine not. Thinking of moving there actually  great place for people with real intelligence. Texas will always have a place in my heart.  It really is great to live here.  Abbott has made it very clear  multiple times that this will not happen. Do I believe him  He  39 s a politician. Just keep your ears up and eyes open.   em laughs in Nebraskan  em   Joke s on you  they re going to re able you just to get you fired  The reality is that the entire world would collapse harder than the great depression.  It could be fun to watch for us country boys...  Even you country boys use modern stuff you buy in a store. You  39 re on Reddit  which means at a bare minimum you have a cellphone or laptop with an internet connection. I  39 m guessing you didn  39 t build said electronic device with materials you harvested from the earth beneath your feet with your own two hands. You farm  Educated guess says you have a whole hell of a lot of tractors and such. Or are you just some country bumpkin held up in a ratty log cabin in the hills somewhere  without so much as a Social Security number  Clearly not  because again  you  39 re on Reddit. Shit goes pear shaped  it is going to affect EVERYONE in this country. It will affect some more than others  but it will be incredibly detrimental to all of us.  Pretty sure it would be the exact opposite  Imagine two economies  one conservative and capitalistic but with some bare bones regulations to avoid monopolies  one run by AOC and Bernie Sanders. Lol  The only way this could happen is if you had a spaceship that could take you to another planet.   We  39 ve already played the  quot go start your own country quot  card  the Earth is fresh out of those.  Just gotta wait for Elon Musk to get Mars ready for us.  I  39 d consider living on a frigid  airless  waterless  irradiated dusty rock if it meant being 33 million miles away from progressives.  I saw a funny meme about that. Something like  quot you need to accept us into your space quot    gt   quot you need to add our regulations to avoid offending people quot    gt   quot if you don  39 t like it make your own space quot  and the cycle repeats.  What if you could sign up for a government like you do for health insurance  You choose one and abide by their laws  receive their benefits  pay their taxes and incur their debts. You only switch side during open enrollment every 6 years. Sure  traffic laws and others would be shared by all. But taxes and social safety nets could vary.  They think if they take everything they can from 75 million people that there will be peace   Don  39 t be silly they  39 ll just redefine peace.  Reality is not an obstacle for pathologically insane.   removed   That will also be when they find out how everything was paid for.  Just like all the people in China  So peaceful   It s turned into a witch hunt. Never thought I d see the day.  Nah  Witch Hunts have always been political purges   even in Salem and Medieval Europe.  This has been the leftist  39 s end game since 2016.  Trump wasn t supposed to win in 2016. Clinton was supposed to be CCP s ticket to the White House then. Trump foiled their plans  and has been making it worse for them ever since  thus their seething hatred.  1877.  Yeah I  39 m wondering if we should get the heck outta New England and move to Florida or Texas where they still have some semblance of freedom...  As a Floridian  I recommend Texas.   removed    removed   Welcome to why I  39 m hesitant to make a Gab or Parler account. This terrifies me.   removed   Why  You can just say  quot well I have an Instagram  Facebook   whatever   does that make me a liberal  quot   quot If I have both  am I both  quot  Maybe it means you  39 re one of those dirty independents   .  Sure  words and logic will convince them   Hmm I made a Parler account back in November just to see what it is. I never used it since and never put my personal info on it. I wonder if I  39 m on AOC  39 s list   No one out anything personal on it unless they wanted to on their own. I ve had an account and it was as easy as Twitter  It  39 s ok  they justified it by outright lying in the very first sentence of the article and saying Parler was  quot used to plan the storming of the US Capitol quot .   Also there weren  39 t just conservatives on there...  Conservative holocaust is starting.  My instincts to stay off Parler are paying off  especially when they wanted all that personal information. That was a hard nope for me. Also   quot security researchers quot  is pretty funny.  This is why I never got a Parler. You had to identify yourself. The internet should be anonymous.  You only had to if you wanted a verified badge. You could use it without it.  This is true. They did this as a verified status like the blue checkmark on Twitter.  It was optional actually  Except you need to supply a phone number to even sign up.  I signed up and used it for a bit then left. Guess I  39 m fucked. Like an idiot I used my actual email address too.  In the article there is a link where you can see if your stuff was included in the leak.  TY. Didn  39 t see that link. I  39 m safe for now apparently.  There were several things in that article that pissed me off  but the opening sentence   We lost control when we became more concerned about views clicks  and likes then we did ACTUALLY PRESENTING FACTUAL INFORMATION.  The response is going to draw more support for radicals on both sides. The whole thing is a mess  I liked it better when journalists didn t editorialize in every article.   strong Leaked  strong  by  em security researchers  em  Yep this is 100  newskpeak   quot Security researchers quot   The entire government was hacked by Russia  and no one is talking about it  A lot of people have been talking about russia interfering in US politics for several years now. I mean  em a lot  em  of content has been said and written about that topic.   quot security researchers quot   looks like im changing my phone number and never signing up to parler or twitter or any other social media that asks for my phone number.  Well  I sure am glad I never signed up on Parler.   quot Since  don enby did not carry out the data scrape secretively  there s little to worry about from an ethics perspective. However  Alkhatib agrees that if the data scrape was targeted towards minority groups  there d be a lot more to worry about. quot  These people are literally insane.  What  39 s amazing is that the criminal hacker who did this just openly brags about it on Twitter like nothing will happen to her.  Everything she stole is fruit of the poisoned tree.  She is both civilly and criminally liable for anything that happens to Parler users as a result of her crime.  That s if we had impartial judges and rule of law.  I  39 m glad they are getting rid of mean evil violence promoting Parler.  One might think these  quot security researchers quot  were given access by Amazon itself.  Democrats are fascists.  Don  39 t be afraid to call them out on it  either.  They really are   deleted    Researchers    the beginning of the democrat  39 s own  em stasi  em   The Twitter user talking about the information said it  39 s all public information. Only posts that were publicly available.  Parler makes you give them a phone number.  Is this why I got a weird fucking text message accusing me of being a Trump Supporter from an IL area code     The corpo fascists at it again   quot researchers quot   By Amazon  Is this confirmed  Wouldn  39 t they just dump the data so people could go through it and see if their coworkers are on the list like with Ashley madison.   They want you living in fear.  Well  when the opposition resource is hit financially by PTB  all aspects of it are hit and security is an expensive part.   Uh huh  leaked. I knew this fucking shit was a honey pot. Thankfully I didn  39 t use the site.  Am I woefully ingnorant about Parler.  I joined to see what is there this summer and it was kind of boring.  Loads of  quot AOC dumb quot  and  quot don  39 t vote for communism quot  meme type comments so I stopped scrolling through there.  I joined more as an F you to twitter than because I love social media. Did I miss some part where they  39 re calling for assassinations or something   and that  39 s why i never use anything tied to me anymore.  If I didn  39 t work for my family  39 s company I  39 d be scared for my job right now. This is disgusting.
t3_kve4hv,Idaho internet company blocks Facebook Twitter over censorship,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kve4hv/idaho_internet_company_blocks_facebook_twitter/,If the dems don  39 t have a problem of these companies blocking people  then they shouldn  39 t complain  Yeah  but Washington state ....   They will do something.   Idaho and Montana   well we are the last hold out up here.  Also  allowing a ISP to block a webpage is just as bad don  39 t you think   Yes it s just as bad. I don t know how the answer to censorship is more censorship  We re as the ass end of this shit  it all needs to stop  Yeah  I think I  39 m with you   more censorship doesn  39 t feel like the answer.  Fight fire with fire. Fuck em. Gab.com is better anyway  Exactly Mutually Assured Destruction  Fuck them  This is why net neutrality is so important.  What goes around  comes around. Right Dorsey   I  39 d be pretty pissed off if my ISP pulled this. They implemented because people called in complaining  saying they don  39 t want their children on the sites. Come on  fucktard  be a parent and configure your  em home  em  network then  and block whatever you want. Or take your kids phone away. I get it guys but this is such a bullshit play for an ISP to make.  Or buy a router that lets you block stuff like that. It s not that difficult to do it at the home level.  Yeah that  39 s what I meant by configure your home network...I don  39 t think you can even buy a router that doesn  39 t let you block shit anymore.  That  39 s what I  39 m saying  this is a matter of a lot of people  39 s freedoms. I don  39 t use that shit  but if I wanted to I should be able to.  They asked for the ISP to block it to their home specifically  this ISP figured they  39 d get less requests to turn the site on for an address than to turn it off.  Ahahahahah in the article it claims that blocking it violates net neutrality laws. These oligarchs can t have it both ways. Oh how the turn tables  Weren  39 t those laws taken down by ajit pai   Federal  effectively yes.  Says they will continue to offer the sites to people who ask for them. Not a lot of teeth there...  They have to take the extra step of opting in.  Right now  Yeah you  39 re right. If a competitor is able to arise though then putting barriers in front of them helps any competitor  Nope. Don  39 t like this either. This is how we end up with  quot bundled quot  internet services.  I would immediately drop my ISP if they pulled this. Two wrongs don t make a right  and at the end of the day I just want to be left alone and not told what to do think. This really annoys me.  You are assuming there are other options. Rural internet can be kinda difficult to find sometimes.  Hey man someone  39 s gotta take a stand  clearly it  39 s not you  lol.  Sweet  Isn t this just more censorship  Don t fight fire with fire.  yes  they violated the internet company  39 s  quot policies quot .  I don t want to start playing this game.  If they really want to twist the knife claim its over threats of violence on their platforms.  Rock on.  quot Its their isp  they can do what they want with it quot  get fukt commies  Works for me  as long as there  39 s healthy competition in the ISP space  which there is not.  I agree  there is plenty of competition in social media.  I can use Facebook.  Wait.  Instagram  oh damnit.  I ll use Twitter  my post is disputed.  Ok  I ll use Parler.  Oh  shit.  Good competition.  Guess MySpace still is a thing   Gab.com is going to put a hurtin  39  on twitter and facebook. Great UI. Will be faster by end of week.  Now block Amazon for AWS  Parler.  A lot of violence is actually caused by twitter  the more you know  That s a fight back of rang.  That  39 s it. If I can get a job in Idaho I  39 m moving.  Inciting violence isn t free speech. No one cares what northern Idaho does. It s full of extremist. Anyone driving from MT to WA will tell you to not stop.

Plummeting bigly. We had the greatest tanning beds before. SAD   Theyve gone too far this time.  This one would hit him where it hurts.  Now you have officially carried it too far buddy  We  39 ve been hearing so much about China lately that I first thought this was some chinese city and my reaction was  quot big fucking deal  why would he want to even OOOOOHHHHHH I get it. quot   BB not pulling their blows even in these tense times. I  39 d laugh but I  39 m too busy prepping for the big D coming to bugger us good  This is definitely a pattern I  39 ve noticed. The right can satirize both sides and be lighthearted about it. The left can only satirize the right and has to make it sharp enough to draw blood.  The Onion ran  a href  https   politics.theonion.com scrambling democrats rush to begin impeachment hearings 1846019087  this  a  and  a href  https   www.theonion.com democrats declare nation has given them clear mandate t 1846001988  this  a  in the last week.  This is a large part why SNL isn t funny anymore.   Most of Comedy Central is this way  but I will admit that South Park does a good job of burning both sides. The rest of the shows... not so much.   quot we hate conservatives  but we  em really  em  hate liberals quot    matt stone  That quote is more than ten years old now.   South Park made an episode apologizing to Al Gore for making fun of his global warming hysterics in the original man bear pig episode. They ve gotten soft.  That  39 s nice depending on if matt stone is a socialist  quot progressive  quot  or more of a libertarian. Sometimes people call themselves libertarian but are actually begging for Marxism.  Sometimes people just hate politics and don  39 t care enough to have a side.  Everyone has an opinion  some people have just given it less thought.  Well put.  SNL is no longer a entertainment show but more of an indoctrination show.  Wait a few months  Biden will call a foreign leader the wrong name and they  39 ll start making jokes about him being the oldest president to be elected. At some point in the next four years we  39 ll see Jim Carey riding a rascal scooter in a white wig yelling about missing the early bird buffet at the Capital dining hall.   I always liked Mad TV more. Half their stuff wouldn t be made today. Miss Swan haha.  What would happen if SNL brought back pat   I think Pat would be welcomed actually because she d be an enby lol. The actress that played her wanted to keep the mystery but said someone came up to her and knew Pat was a woman because of how she kissed the male actor in their skit. She responded like a woman  because she is a woman  and the actress thought it was a funny tell.  Frank Caliendo  has an amazing mimicry. Too bad his show never got off the ground.   I loved mad tv  and ms swan. it s not my fault the Asian accent is both ugly and funny. If Asians don t want to get made fun of  don t move here. Simple really. Or get rid of the accent. American Asians are a little less funny.  As a kid I never thought it was truly mocking Asians. She was just a kind of frustrating or annoying but hilarious woman.  eh  not really true. You might just not be watching enough left media to see it.   This is a great observation. It needs to be highlighted more. I wonder if the Bee can satirize this concept in a way that really nails it so people will notice.  I m just happy I live in the US  a country where politicians aren t silenced.  Twitter objects   Is this satire   How do you handle real world scenarios where jokes don t have satire tags  Of course I m joking   It was a rhetorical question  but idk with this sub anymore  most seem to be boot licking  or at least concern trolling.  The quote should have been him saying he doesn  39 t even go there.  How is the left going to fill their day once Trump is out of office  They suffer from TDS so much that I dont think they will know what to do come January 21st.  Finally  a peaceful solution to get rid of orange man   Maybe if he  39 s no longer orange they won  39 t dislike him   It bothers me how politicians go crazy on the tan spray. We get it. More people think it  39 s not okay to be white than think it  39 s not okay to be dark  and you need the votes of those mortally deficient people too.  Just make it a little more subtle.  To be fair  he  39 s not as  quot Orange quot  as they make him seem. They punch up the saturation when they put pictures of him up.  Saturation or not  orange will always be a stereotype for people who use artificial tans. It doesn  39 t matter if it  39 s the President or Jersey Shore.  Oh  I agree  but they try to make it more than it is because they think it  39 s an epic burn.  This one is a miss. 
t3_kvf47p,Idaho Internet Provider Blocks Facebook Twitter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvf47p/idaho_internet_provider_blocks_facebook_twitter/,Lmao the war of who can cancel who  Except they re not canceling these sites despite what the headline would lead you to believe. This article clearly says they will continue to offer them to customers who want them  and will block them for customers who want them blocked.  So.  Like a router.  ISPs definitely have the upper hand in this war. Unfortunately  the  majors   AT amp T  Comcast  Charter Spectrum  Verizon  etc  are all liberal media conglomerates so good luck getting them to join in. It will be up to the small regional ISPs to take charge  and most of their customers are the same ones who abandoned the majors because of their shitty business practices to begin with.  There  39 s always a bigger fish  This is like the end of War Games where HAL virtually cancels the US and Russia  RHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE     Keep going  there  39 s more states.  Free market this bitches  Exactly  2 can play at this game Zuck.  Good to note. A company blocking service to a widely popular website despite it being a toxic dumpster fire despite what people want  is equally unjustified  What  39 s the point of blocking it if you don  39 t use it   Workplaces   I  39 m sure gonna hurt the ad revenue.  The provider isnt blocking BF and twitter across the board.  It requires users to request a block on them.  What  39 s the point in requesting a block if you don  39 t use it in the first place   Maybe in search engines FB stuff not gonna show up. Maybe reaching young audience will be hard now too. Dont know but should have some negative effect.  Amusing.  Not quite apples to apples since neither Facebook nor Twitter have a legal arrangement with this ISP to host their services.  Suck it Fuckerberg.  Man this picture of the fuckerberg really captures what a psycho he is.  God bless them. Hope more follow suit.  I like this.  It really raises the question  if one believes in the principles of net neutrality  should it extend to all internet infrastructure vendors such as AWS.  This is one of the most based things I  39 ve heard of in a long time.    Love it. Good for them. We can pressure twitter advertisers and our isps as well folks.  About time we fight fire with fire.  Time to email my ISP  Fake doubt. They can  39 t even use the correct whether  weather  right. Not to mention the ISP is really  really insignificant. Don  39 t play the ISP ban war. Comcast  att etc will NOT side with us. Besides  this sourced from a Twitter post. Please don  39 t post this garbage.  Haha awesome  Ultra Based  Wow  can  39 t believe that some homies from the 509 had enough balls to do this. Major respect for my fellow Spokanites
t3_kvhzji,Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Its time that we simply put wokeism to sleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvhzji/secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo_its_time_that_we/,IS THAT A THREAT        SEDITIOOOON REEEEEEEEEE  Nancy.... Didn  39 t know you had so many alt accounts.   Hang on do I hear Mike Pompeo...  He s literally worse than Hitler. Words are violence.  It s not his words. It s what I assume the meaning to be behind his words. That s my truth.  But his presence is alone is violence. And silence is violence.  I  39 m literally shaking right now  With their big brain logic  me liking vanilla ice cream could be inciting violence  because someone else might not like it and attack someone who eats vanilla ice cream because I like it. This is a mental illness.  No  their logic works like this   Sleep  Kill it. Kill it with fire.  Nuke it from orbit.  EXTERMINATUS  This guy has stuck beside Trump and has balls because the DC swamp will punish anyone for being trump friendly at this point.   deleted   Him  Sidney Powell  Gen. Flynn and the Stop the Steal guys need a comic book about Patriots fighting fascism  Do you mean president Pompeo    I would love to see a President Pompeo VP DeSantis presidency.  pompeo 2020 when all of Congress is jailed  Yo  Pompeo fucks  He fucks his wife no doubt  and maybe even your mother. But the good thing is he would never dog you about it in public like Trump would on Twitter.  Dreams  He and Pence are really doing a great job right now despite all that s going on.  He realizes the truth which is the entire Trump Administration can  39 t get any more fucked than it was the second The Big Guy won. So why not speak truth   There goes Mike  39 s Twitter account   Not going to happen.  The left and their propaganda media friends will use it to silence all opposition.  Pompeo is a good dude  good sense of humour  has honor. I think Trump and him would be good running mates.  There s no way trump will run again. Hate to say it.  Sorry yeah I wasn  39 t hoping for anything. More an alternative reality idea. I agree it would be a stretch to think trump would run again but trump has done and survived a lot of things others politicians could never manage. So I  39 m not counting him out totally.  Agreed. Finally have a guy that s putting us first and somehow within a year the media Commiecrats managed to flip the script and make him look like the asshole.   We first need to have some honest media outlets. That s the only chance we have again. The left has the entire mainstream media in their pocket. There needs to be balance and truth if we want to stand a chance  I see the ONE woman on death row won a stay. So much for equal treatment for women. A lot more than one had done violent crimes and then when only one gets on there  people fight to get her off of it. lol.  Except it s not like the toddler who constantly wants a glass of water and another story and another lullaby in a glass of milk  the toddler is actually a tiger. And we will never financially recover from this  Put to sleep with an ever so soft pillow over the face held by a person wearing a velvet glove.  Time to educate these leftists about Freedom  I  39 m going to be very sad to see Pompeo leave the State department.  Best Secretary of State we  39 ve had in a very long time  IMO.  It s extremely toxic but I think that is by design.  If wokeism took a hike I d be one happy camper   quot Woking Dead quot  cannot be put to sleep.  Traitor
t3_kv5vj6,Trump Is Being Urged to Officially Recognize Taiwan as He Leaves Office,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv5vj6/trump_is_being_urged_to_officially_recognize/,Good. He should do it. Taiwan should have the right to autonomy from China.  He should  because Biden won t have the balls to do it  and nor will he have the balls to walk it back .  I  39 m not sure it takes balls to walk it back.  The CCP will exert pressure like never before.  They ll lower the budget on Hunter s drugs and trafficked girls money.  biden is too in bed with china to dare even think about it.  It will be really bad optics when Biden walks it back too.  But china has been preparing for this war  you are really going to put them out.  I just attempted to post a response to the ccp hacker questions and got booted off the webpage.  Should recognize Hong Kong  Taiwan  and Tibet while calling out China as human rights abusers.  Fuck the CCP   I have concerns the CCP has already infiltrated the United States. Housing investments  banking  tech  government officials  news media outlets  and other entire industries. The use of news propaganda within the US is strikingly similar to the CCP.  And the people who absorb the propaganda are all repeating the same things  as if they ve been consumed by an ideology and have lost a sense of personal experience.    quot For all mankind quot   The situation that we  39 re heading into is even worse than China  39 s. In China  corporations are forced to answer to the government. In a Democrat run America  the government is forced to answer to corporations. And corporations have no loyalty to their countrymen  only to the highest international bidder.  Feinstein s driver was a Chinese spy  and at her side for 20 years.  Agreed. It is really suspicious how the media treated the term  quot China virus quot  as a bigger deal than the fact that China kept the virus secret while allowing people to fly out of their country and spread it worldwide.   They very well have  My biggest fear  as a dude who spent 4 years there.  Well considering the guy who just stole the election is bought and paid for by China  I  39 d say you are correct.   Im just curious  what ramifications would this have  Would that be something biden would try to  undo    Acknowledging them is merely symbolic  but China would pressure Biden to deny their independence. It s basically just Trump putting Biden in a lose lose situation.  I like the sound of that.  I don  39 t   even those on the left abhor the practices of the ccp. With Biden taking office they can only demonize trump for so long before they need a new devil.  Better that energy be channeled towards actual violators of human rights.  China is not  Yeah  there are others. But common man   It would piss off China and could potentially lead to a regional conflict. Though China knows Trump is on his way out so they would put their pressure on Biden to recant. It would make Biden look bad if he did.  Why not   Cause the US government are pussies  You can  39 t recognize Hong Kong. It was in the rules to give it back.  It  39 s a dumb move. Don  39 t you play civ.  He should do it. It s up to America which states we recognize. The CCP doesn t give us a veto over their foreign policy.  Lol  might as well do it    He should do all he can while he has a chance to.  It s a smart idea  force Biden to reverse it on the record and confirm  BeijingBiden for all to see.  Cos we all know Biden isn  39 t gonna do it as it would upset the money from his ccp businesses.  And itll be interesting to see Biden backtrack it.  President Trump should recognize the Republic of China  Taiwan  as the one and only genuine representative of China. The CCP should be seen as an illegitimate entity in the eyes of American foreign policy.  Yes  it  39 s time we make this cold war public. It  39 s been going on silently for decades  and the American people should know who their real enemy is  Yes   and that includes showing the American nation the real enemy pulling the strings behind Biden. Xi   It  39 s tempting  but not not particularly practical given existing treaties and the UN Security Council. Plus  while I doubt Biden would have the balls to walk back Taiwan recognition  you can be damn sure he  39 d reverse what you propose immediately. So if the end goal is benefiting Taiwan  the more moderate course proposed by others here is the superior options.  That would definitely make Biden  39 s Chinese masters angry.   removed   Chinese taxes pay Biden  not the other way around.  He  39 s  quot the big guy quot .  This would be a incredibly moral thing to do. Taiwan deserves freedom.  Pardon Snowden and order all troops home while your at it.  Snowden would likely have to remain on the run. A presidential pardon won  39 t mean anything to the deep state gremlins he pissed off.  Doesn  39 t mean he shouldn  39 t still be pardoned.  Agreed.  I agree with Snowden but pulling everyone out at the same time is a bad idea.  Pardoning Snowden would be amazing. I hate how he gets lumped into a group with assange.  Do it. Fuck China  JUST DO IT   We never should have recognized the CCP.  Communist governments are illegitimate by definition.  The rightful government has always been the original republican government that the Communists exiled to Taiwan after the takeover of Beijing.  If I recall my history correctly  Taiwan held China  39 s seat in the UN until we wrongly recognized the Communist government in the 70s.  Correct but US recognition of the PRC over ROC and the UN seat switching from ROC to PRC happened separately but in a relatively short time frame from one another.  I assumed that there was a correlation. Either way that was far before my time.  Yea well hes being urged to do alot he doesn  39 t seem to care about or have the guts to do unfortunately  Yes definitely   Recognize Taiwan  Tibet and Hong Kong. Last act will be remembered in the history  YES  Do it.  Definitely should recognize Taiwan.  This should be supported across the aisle  China is gonna steamroll Taiwan now because Biden will do nothing except issue a strongly worded statement.  Yep. He  39 ll issue a  quot red line quot  and about two seconds later China will cross over it without a care in the world.  Just like obummer did  Man  when I read this  I was like helllll yeeeesss  This is another reason Democrats are trying to rush Trump out. He is going to kick some ass on the way out.  Too late.  Should have been done day one.  The U.S. has not officially recognized Taiwan because the policy of the U.S. since Nixon and Kissinger opened up the PRC was to pretend Taiwan was just a separatist group that would eventually reunite with the mainland.  I thought they were already recognized as a country  Wow that sucks. I guess Taiwan is in the same situation as Hong Kong and Tibet. China is terrible  Thankfully Taiwan doesn  39 t have to live under the totalitarian heel of China link Hong Kong and Tibet do  but it  39 s so sad how so many governments and companies bow down before the CCP.  It  39 s sickening.  Why did we not already do this years ago  Doesn  39 t Taiwan not want this  They consider themselves the rightful government of china and thus part of china  not just Taiwan.  You re getting downvoted but it s a good question.  Are 3 and 4 not the same   3 refers to the US recognizing  a country separate from China called Taiwan  and 4 refers to the US recognizing  two countries that both make up China.  Sorry for the lack of clarity but the entire China and Taiwan subject is a ridiculous headache because there are so many logistical name related issues.  True. Thank you for the clarification.  It s the right thing to do and it screws Beijing 10  for the big guy  Biden. Perfect policy.  Nothing says successful president like starting a war a week before you leave office.  Embassy in Taiwan or bust. China plans to invade on April 1 remember that  The only thing that can save Taiwan.  This would be great.  Fuck yea do it.  Idk if it makes sense recognize Hong Kong if the British treaty did specify they d give it back to China.   You know what  Why the hell not at this point   Please   And Hong Kong  Tibet  and East Turkmenistan as well   Well the problem with Hong Kong is that it isn  39 t independent at all. It  39 s not an autonomous state that China claims as theirs. It legitimately is China  39 s at the moment  not that I  39 m happy about that . That would be like China recognizing Puerto Rico  39 s independence.  Not to mention the US has a consulate  not an embassy  in Hong Kong so that d complicate things.  Taiwan doesn  39 t want to be recognized as Taiwan. They want to be recognized as China. Doing so would flip the table on US Chinese relations. China would 100  cancel any trade with the US. Now I would totally be in favor of that but I doubt any politician is willing to mix things up like that. It would be great to see Trump do it and then leave Biden in the awkward position of having to renounce it though.  Taiwan wants to be recognized period. The entire  should we remain de jure China or get rid of the Chinese label  debate is mostly predicated on the fact that most people don t see themselves as Chinese  last I checked the percentage of Taiwanese who saw themselves as Chinese was less than ten percent  but reluctantly continue to call themselves China because otherwise the CCP might get angry and start an annexation campaign.  Yeah early on you had a bunch of exiles wanting to return to the mainland but their kids and grandkids started to identify with a separate Taiwanese identity instead.  Brilliant   Remember fuck communist China.  Fuck it  if he  39 s gonna scorched earth on his way out  might as well do something good with it  Oh God please yes. One last F U to China would be great  PLEASE DO   Do it.  Do it

The left also seems to overreact. But that could be a related side effect.  You just figured this out   embarrassingly  yes. I knew that the left always seems to come down on whatever side of an issue that benefits them  but the thinking behind it didn  39 t occur to me until recently.   Welcome to the discussion we been trying to get through peoples heads for years. Why is it so damn hard   Everyone likes to think that they themselves are normal. Anything that deviates from that is looked at as being undesirable. So when someone sees something on opposite ends of the spectrum from themselves  it  39 s seems unbelievable or  em not normal  em ...and that makes people uncomfortable. In turn  they avoid it.   Yea you  39 re right.. difficult and frustrating for those of us that have been trying to say these things our whole life. Tired of feeling like we are talking to a wall of know it all that know nothing apparently.  Welcome to the club. We  39 ve been trying to tell people this all over reddit for years  Do you have a link to an image of that tweet   Not the Bee the site that has articles so absurd you wod they were satire but aren  39 t  now has an article about something they posted.  Crazy.  Big tech  we ve censored  banned and de platformed all conservative voices.  More like  Sounds like 4chan. White supremacist symbol  anyone   Would have been totally okay if a left leaning outlet had posted it though.  How long before the bee is kicked off hosting platforms  You are strictly forbidden from directly quoting us.  No  the irony is Not beautiful.  It  39 s scary.  Truly.  Instagram is owned by Facebook  of course.  WE are moving in the direction of countries like Canada  where posting facts  like government crime stats  is considered a crime punishable by prison.  Authoritarian figures like Hitler and Stalin would ve wished they lived in our timeline.  My wife defected from the Soviet world in the   39 80  39 s. She watches CNN and says... quot I do to know that tone. I have to be heard these words before. These people are to be very dangerous. quot   Maybe they do    Oh for sure.   They are the most powerful propaganda tools in human history. Nothing is as effective or easy to use to brainwash the masses.  No  they  39 d have been ineffectual as politicians.  And the United Kingdom   where a  a href  https   www.telegraph.co.uk news uknews crime 11069178 Rotherham researcher sent on diversity course after raising alarm.html  researcher employed by the Home Office was sent on  quot diversity training quot  after observing mostly men from the Indian subcontinent were sexually abusing young white girls  a .  Yep  this exactly the stuff.  Does that exist in Canada  Please give me an example  They  39 re likely referring to C 16 bill  which at first I thought it was outlawing misgendering transsexual people.   Hate Facts  Yup.  Sorry bub. You skipped Canada and went straight to China.  Yep...likely so.  Simply put  there was a coup on Jan 6th. Only it wasn  39 t the rednecks in DC who took over  it was Silicon Valley.    quot I pledge allegiance  to the terms and conditions of the United oligarchs of America... quot   Wait  where did you get that idea   communism eats itself  It  39 s going to try to eat all of us first though.  Ya that  39 s the problem  it takes millions of people to die before leftists think  quot hey... em maybe  em  this wasn  39 t such a great idea  quot . Then millions more die before it really sinks in.  Funny how Instagram suddenly cares so much about  inciting violence  yet it was given a free pass all summer. Funny how twitter and Facebook claim to care so much about  spreading misinformation  but they spread so much of it.   Yes. The question before us now is  what do we do about it   Idk. Feels pretty powerless. They say get a new app  then that app is shut down. The best thing for everyone would be to just totally get off of social media. It s the downfall of society.  That s what one part of the whole issue. I meant about the whole issue...the loss of liberty and the rise of a Chinese communist type authoritarian government.  These seemingly independent companies are functioning very much like organs in the same authoritarian  state controlled media.  They  39 re working together and  backing each other up.  They  39 re the unified voice of our new rulers.  Another how 2021 is more like 1984 than 1984.  Orwell was an optimist   Unlimited power is apt to corrupt the minds of those who possess it    Willam Pitt.  That will be the new excuse  anything posted that makes Leftism look bad will be considered  quot inciting violence. quot   I  39 m waiting for Twitter to just ban itself at this point. The rules they have put forward means the entire platform will eventually ban itself.  This is a really concerning time  in this country. We are heading down a really dark path and I don t see anything stopping it.  This crap is really unbelievable  And we  39 re just getting started. 2021 is going to be a doozy.    that s the worst part  it s just getting started.  Fuck Twitter   They are going to ban us all. They are not going to let this opportunity to stamp out populism and the movement as they may never get this chance again. They are openly saying this and have for awhile. The idiots that hurt a cop snd went in bldg instead of just gathering outside gave the left just what they needed.  This. Storming the capital was a real a dangerous  stupid  and disrespectful move  and the democrats will forever hold this against all conservatives.  Burning police stations  courthouses  etc are also equally terrible  but democrats will make sure those are forgotten .  Could be but either way it didn t help us imo  I  39 ve interviewed people who worked on the Facebook  quot Policy quot  team and left to other pastures. They  39 re very  very   very underqualified individuals who were hired straight out of college  most of them  as i understand it are either in the US on a temporary work visa from another country such as India or Turkey  or are located in dense offices of contract workers in these low cost countries.  And thus  a young Facebook employee is now back out on the job market.  Kiss my keister Twotter  I love the smell of leftist irony in the morning  I wouldn  39 t be surprised if someone is up to something locally because the radio station that has hannity  rush  beck  etc... keeps randomly having the audio of the shows go out and extremely loud buzzing noises for up to minutes at a time  then the show comes back in for a few mins  then repeat.... yesterday and today.

Asks federal judge to order Amazon to reinstate the platform,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvcv5l/parler_sues_amazon_for_antitrust_violation_breach/,I don  39 t know what their chances are of any sort of positive result  anything    but I  39 m rooting for them.  The only way Parler doesn t win is if the court system is as corrupt as some here think it is...  So they have no chance  Judge  Theres no evidence that this disruption caused damage to Parlers service   You have no evidence and are a threat to democracy for alleging this  Wait  you do have evidence  Sorry  you filed too late    quot You don  39 t have standing quot    Latches . Parler isn t even on the APP Store and doesn t even have servers. What right do they have to sue Twitter  are real social media app      It  39 s a good cause of action.  You  39 d think Parler would hire a larger  more powerful firm. Amazon is going to retain a monster.  Their previous firm dumped them because of hey didn t want to go against amazon  Parler got assigned Jimmy Carter appointee  but I have hopes. Read the complaint.  A Carter appointee.  Is this guy 95 years old   Does he even know what the internet is   I m just surprised there are any Carter appointees left lol  I read it  although I  39 m no expert on the Sherman Act. The remaining claims are fairly straight forward.  Democrats back then weren t all Stalinists  fortunately.  I can only pray.  Why was there not a backup plan  Why are they even aligned with big tech   Because we have all been encouraged to move our services onto the cloud. It was supposed to be more secure  and require less IT services. Ironically  I have been pushing my employer to deploy our services to the cloud for years  Azure web services . And my employer has been reluctant  we host our own services on premises.    This exactly.  At this rate we re going to have to etch out our own silicon wafers to make our own cpus.  I can do that ..  kinda. I  39 m pretty sure I could build a decent 8 bit computer.  I was in the process of evaluating the cost. Its really hard to do even using their calculators.  Even Amazon.com started off renting someone else s servers back in the day. You don t just go build a server of your own out of the gate.   You can buy servers from Dell  HP  IBM  and many other  39 s for less than 1000 dollars. Order 20 or so of these and you can host a pretty large website. Then you just have to pay for internet access  and you can get that from many sources.  You don  39 t need 20 servers. These machines are JUICED   Seems like a logical thing to ensure your survival though. Building a server in the 1990s is a little different than doing so in the 2020s.  If you had to build your own server every time you wanted to start a website or app  no one would get anything off the ground. The overhead would be astronomical.   If you are relying on their services  yes you are aligned with big tech. This is exactly how they continue to dominate and grow  paying for and using their services.  We do and have done so forever  but it  39 s just not as scalable as what the big cloud services provide  but that may change soon. Maybe buy Dell stock. But even Dell pushes cloud services.  We are with you  Parler   Why did they use Amazon servers in the first place  That seems like an obvious mistake.  We use Azure  but that  39 s not the real issue. The issue is between AWS and Azure that  39 s the entire market. Though  they should move the Azure and see if they are the commie cocksukers I think they are.  There s money in them Amazon hills   Send in the clowns   Oops. Lawyers   An idea someone commented to me in a different sub   We couldn  39 t even get the courts to look at an allegedly fraudulent election. What makes you think that they would give a flying fuck about free speech on the internet   Laches.  Should have sued earlier   now you  39 re already kicked off   How did they sue when they said all their lawyers dropped them   Right on   I m not a flaired user. My bad. Everything lately is flaired users only  and I just don t have the time to make that many comments to get flaired. Serious question  can we initiate some kind of class action lawsuit against Amazon for violating our 1st Amendment rights   Considering your 1A is in relation to the government you wouldn  39 t be successful on those grounds.  So  I read this and this seems pretty strong to me. The one problem I can see is that they really don t have the facts on the conspiracy element of the anti trust claim but that isn t necessarily unexpected at this juncture.  Nice  Suing in Washington  Probably a liberal judge.  Prediction  mountain of evidence disregarded  case dismissed for lack of standing.  Much harder when you claim there are  em tortious business practices.  em   Judges  you should have come to us earlier  but now that you are its too late. 
t3_kvhxyd,European Leaders Have a Lot to Say About Twitter Booting Trump None of It Good for Twitter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvhxyd/european_leaders_have_a_lot_to_say_about_twitter/,Europe gets it because they ve already seen what happens when a movement comes in and outlaws everything except for what follows the party line.  Yup  death  destruction and tanks.  Lots of tanks.  When left ass Europe starts taking Trump  39 s side you know it  39 s bad.  Yeah because everyone except for the brainwashed Americans can see through the censorship and corruption that is occurring right in front of American lives. It is so clear like crystal clear that the left is trying to eradicate anything and everything and anyone that opposes and disagrees with their narrative. Silencing  censoring  controlling  by all means to continue their ultimate plan of complete power. They have brainwashed so many people who can no longer think on their own  they hook up to their tv and social media at night and the brainwashing continues.   I agree with everything except I see this as the resurgence of America. We can all see it happening  very slowly  more and more people are seeing the hypocrisy and  em the sickness  em  of the leftists. Trump and TDS have opened many people  39 s eyes to the absolute garbage they are. We got the walkaway movement  the blexit movement  ect out of Trump. Never before could a  em Republican  em  President win so much of the culture wars. It  39 s not instantaneous  but it is happening. Trump has given people who used to stay silent a voice and it will continue to grow when he  39 s out of office  I think it actually helps when he is out of office. If Biden goes along with his leftist agendas  I see his presidency being the straw and the flood gates opening.   I  39 ll continue saying and believing that Trump isn  39 t the President or the type of President I want forever in this country  but he is 100  the President this country needs right now  will be using past tense soon . I  39 m one of the many that wished he  39 d shut the hell up and let policies do his talking but in reality we needed exactly what we got.  I agree with this. We will be fine  the left can t actually win I don t think. Not long term. People are waking up very very quickly  I agree with you on the goals of the left  but as far as European leaders it  39 s just good old fashioned self interest. They are concerned because what stops them from being next.  Dammit  Europe is ahead of the US again... high speed trains  the Autobahn  the metric system. Now free speech    lt shakes fist at sky gt   NOOOOOOOOOooooooooo........  they  39 re only saying something because they know Trump won and has the proof.  It  39 d be nice if he  39 d come out with the proof right about two months ago.  The UK and Europeans EU have been way ahead of the curve vs the US on managing the dangers of Big Tech and holding it to account.  Twitters actions have forever marked Silicon Valley as the enemy of governments the world over. They have shown the world that they are actively involved in manipulating the political process of nations. If they re able to silence the most powerful man in the world. What more can do they do someone of a lesser nation   Big tech and the media are truly the enemy of the people. They need to be dismantled  reformed  and rebuilt.  Most powerful man really only applies to Democrat presidents who have a whole media behind them. Republicans presidents don t get the same  influence  as the media turns against them usually  Hopefully the EU will do what our government will not and legislate these companies and platforms into submission.  But I thought Europe was the most enlightened place ever with  free  college and healthcare    If USA would ever organize things the same as most European countries  Capitol would be taken over by rioting professors  doctors and insurance administrators. What most people forget is that already USA Federal government   1.2 trillion  and states spend to health care the same amount of money as developed European states relative to their GDP. Money is just wasted and overspend.  Twitter has been the most useless internet tech  let s finally put Twitter to grave where it belongs   When the Europeans are criticizing you for censorship you know you ve gone too far.
t3_kv3czt,Trumps Twitter Exile Spurs Opposition From Germany France  Chancellor Merkel calls Trumps ban on Twitter problematic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv3czt/trumps_twitter_exile_spurs_opposition_from/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  https   discord.gg conservative  a   It  39 s something when even leaders who have generally been anti Trump all along are calling this out.  They  39 re afraid that if big tech can ban the President of the United States from social media what exacty stops them from banning other world leaders organizations as well   Which one is official   The damn ACLU has even sided with him. That  39 s how nutty they  39 ve gotten.   Wasn t it just one member of the ACLU   It was quite comforting to see that  though  and I hope something comes of it  When the leader of Germany  not exactly a bastion of free speech  calls you out...  The President of Mexico has condemned this as well  Its Sovereignty and respect understanding of one s differing views. Something so foreign in present day America.  So has Mexico s President....  Exactly  when Germany sees the road you are heading down with authoritarian censorship...its time to listen  Well eventually it can be them too this tech business is showing us who is in charge so             They know they are next.  What s funny is the same people who have been wringing their hands the last 4 years worried about our  perception on the world stage  now have to either explain this away or  more likely  ignore it altogether.  Cuckstin Trudeau is applauding it.  Therrrrrrre  39 s a shock  P  And somehow Netanyahu has been dead silent  Exactly my thought.  It  39 s very bad.  It  39 s easy to forget how aggressively anti trust the EU can be.  In 2004  the EU fined Microsoft the equivalent of  790M because when installing the OS for the first time  it didn  39 t prompt you to install a browser other than IE.  Well Facebook has been pulling another fast one by demanding all the data from WhatsApp can suddenly be used and sold off for profit.  If Zuck had not banned Trump  this outrageous move would have been given so much more media attention.  Thanks for reminding. That means that 230 does not have to be an American law.  Yeah it  39 s creepy as fuck how this cabal of American tech companies will all band together to protect themselves and silence people that don  39 t agree with their West Coast ideologies. I don  39 t like the Fourth Reich all that much  but they do seem to try and protect consumers  39  rights a bit better than we do here at home.  Well anti trust when it  39 s a foreign company.  Do you have any EU companies in mind  like Volkswagen Group   At first I was like  Damn  Twitter just redpilled the ACLU.   And she doesn  39 t even like Trump  so know you know you fucked up when world leaders like her are speaking out against this shit.  Other counties are lecturing the United States about freedom of speech.   countries   there  39 s an  quot r quot  in country.  This story is trending in worldnews also  comments over there are spicy...calling out reddit hypocrisy  Good looking out  hadn  39 t seen that. Always nice to see that not  em every  em  large subreddit has gotten to the point of  pics  amp   politics quite yet.  Dorsey dun fucked up  lol even foreigners know this is wrong   How can America the beacon of freedom just became the small brother of the CCP commie regime   Because our social media platforms are no longer American. They interact with the entire world. They make their profit outside America.  Lol when China bought Forbes  that was our sign  The signs go back to the 90s. Hell probably before that  I was just to young to remember.  Because we  quot elected quot  their puppet.  Yep. China found a way to play our game  without sending troops and bombs.  People have no idea what s coming.  You will either be on the right side or wrong side of history  period. Start taking notes of where your acquaintances stand  because you  39 ll want to know who you can and cannot turn to when the going truly gets tough.    It is now the Beacon of CCP in the west  America hasn  39 t been the beacon of freedom in a long while. Not since we allowed cancel culture to run unchecked.  Every political leader should be voicing their disgust with this. Trump may be on his way out  but he s still the  em sitting President of the United States  em  for God s sake  Social media expects cheers  because so many people worldwide have expressed their hatred for Trump...BUT  Even some who hate him recognize that social media has now become too powerful. And guess what  There s legal precedent for the courts to rule that private companies cannot interfere with free speech. There comes a time when the individual s rights  Trump   lol  pun unintended  my phone capitalized it by itself  personal property business property.  Exactly. You can hate Trump and still see that this is a horrifying precedent.  Does Merkel dislike Trump  I think from what I  39 ve read she does  am I wrong   She  39 s never really hid the fact that she dislikes Trump. More or less just tolerated him whenever they met lol.  This sounds like Merkel. Pragmatic  down to earth  The majority of germans dislike Trump  including the chancellor.  I don  39 t knock Germans  39  opinions of US conservativism all that much seeing as it  39 s been run through the spin cycle 8 times by our news organizations by the time it gets to their eyes and ears.  Dislike is relative. Pres T came in and asked  in his way  the EU to pay up or shut up. When you  39 re used to getting things at a discount and new leadership comes in saying the discount is over  you  39 d be a bit peeved too. In addition  it costs us a ton to sustain military presence there  while Germany makes a ton making and exporting military equipment without sustaining a strong military themselves. It all aligned with Pres T holding our allies more accountable and having some equity especially with those allies that have fairly strong economies.  Trump did try to weaken the current leaders of EU and support the dissenting voices in European Union against German and French dominant position in it. So yeah one could say Merkel has no reason to like Trump  especially since it is likely that a Democrat in the White House would likely be better for their interests.  No fucking shit  World leaders think it  39 s a bad idea to suppress a world leaders communication with the country it leads. Twitter  Facebook and Amazon along with the rest of the California tech companies that think they run the world just put the final nail in their own damn coffin. Yes  a lot of leaders in the world are corrupted by money because they care a lot about it. but you know what they care about a lot more  power. When you fuck with a leaders access to power your kickbacks become null and void.  It  39 s interesting seeing a liberal world leader actually calling this out. I wonder if any Democrat politicians are uneasy about this but unwilling to say anything because they absolutely must toe the line right now.  I have plenty of liberal acquaintances who vote steady  but who are unhappy with many new trends in Democratic party. They privately lament  then vote Democratic anyway.   The world is watching  which means Trump is winning  It means the people are winning.  yes  this 100 . this is a good comment and I like it a lot.  No  they want to act like the few hundred who rioted is the extent.   keep in mind Americans aren  39 t aware of the full extent of their treason yet.  OhI know  the last 3 years have shown that for a lot  it  39 s real to them  and they dont see how a presidency started by being spied on is nuts  it  39 s so much more than just spying. even Rosenstein putting a hit out on Seth Rich is just a tiny  tiny piece of the puzzle  I would honestly love to hear what you think trump stands for. God bless America and the working class around the world.   a href  https   i.imgur.com MOuTT2c.jpg  this unironically  a   I m definitely on board with this one. Satanist wealthy scum run the earth.  I  39 m glad this is getting some international attention. To be honest though  I am very much more worried about the coordinated attacks on Parler from all the leftists tech companies. They are desperate to maintain their ideological cartel on tech.  If you still have a Twitter  best thing is to get rid of it.  Remember  France despises censorship. Charlie Hebdo part one  a few years ago  and Charlie Hebdo part two  a few months ago  sparked some of the largest outrage France has seen in a while. And France frequently is largely outraged over everything.  Where is Antifa through all of this   I thought they opposed fascism   They should be protesting this forced suppression of opposing thought  right    This is the amusing and horrifying part.  As a NYer  western NY   I agree.  Yup  they cloak themselves in moral supremacy   then go use the most extreme labels for everyone else.  Wow  I can  39 t believe I  39 m agreeing with Merkel   Merkel and the president of Mexico are smart enough to know that if America falls to the Socialist  Communist rest of the world would follow.  Because Europe has dealt with fascists before and know the warning signs  and are beginning to fear the authoritarian overreaching of social media and the Democrats.  Much unlike the basement dwelling wannabe commies that pretend anyone who doesn  39 t sing the song of Marx and Engels is a fascist.  You can t put the cat back into the bag...  This is true.    Two can play that game. Ban their apps on your countries for censoring free speech. Let see how fast they bend over.  Even countries without free speech rights know this is ridiculous  Merkel better hope she doesnt have Dominion in her country or she  39 s next with this kind of crazy talk.  We don  39 t use voting machines here in Germany. Only clean paper ballots.  Do you use mail in voting  why or why not   For some context everybody who is allowed to vote here in Germany has the option to request their mail in ballots online. As soon as you do that a notification will be added to the electoral dictionary so you don  39 t get your vote counted twice.   See  there are ways this can be done right  and the point that we have an entire side of the aisle here in America denying we can improve our system because it just bagged them a victory is absolutely disgusting to me.  Well  fuck me.  She would be the one in favor of dominion. I live there.   If they come for me in the morning  they will come for you in the night.      Angela Davis   quot If they can do it to their own president  they can do it to us quot   Well looks like twitter and amazon hosting etc have screwed themselves in Britain.  No company should ever host with Amazon Web Services again.  Every foreign government right now is looking at Twitter and Facebook absolutely stunned.   quot ...Rights like the freedom of speech   39 can be interfered with  but by law and within the framework defined by the legislature    not according to a corporate decision.  39  quot   Google and Amazon have literately destroyed a company consequence free. Just wiped them out off the face of the planet essentially and people are celebrating that like its a good thing. These tech companies are literally controlling free speech and people are cheering it.  The irony of seeing the German Chancellor call out the left for threatening free speech when those same people constantly call us Nazis...it s beautiful.  Never in a billion years would I think I would agree with Angela Merkel on something  Even Merkel  What weird timeline are we in   I don  39 t agree with Angela Merkel on much  but she  39 s right and I  39 m glad that even a liberal leader in a very liberal country can stop and say that this sets a troubling precedent.
t3_kvbxa0,Twitter Shares Drop by 12 Percent After Company Banned Trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvbxa0/twitter_shares_drop_by_12_percent_after_company/,These are rookie numbers.  We need to pump these numbers up.  I had someone tell me via DM it  39 s okay that Conservative voices are being banned on Twitter because they spread lies.   You ought to see what sort of DMs that I get...  Are they death threats like mine   Every day  at least 5 death threats  They sure are. I m averaging one a day from people directly threatening me for posting rational  thought out conservative views.  Where are my death threats  Why am I being left out so ungraciously   Haha haven t had a death threat in a while  mostly just lefties telling me how much they want to hurt me or how they hope I get sexually assaulted and stuff  Those ones are the better ones...I get some pretty depraved heathens.  I don t ever get dms     Ive gotten a few. The most hilarious thing they do is award spam which cracks me up cuz that shit costs money lol.  I get a few the angry dms make my day because I know I am living rent free in their head  Stay here long enough....  Just ask  You ll get em  Took a few weeks for me but now I get several a week telling me how dumb I am in very colorful language . It s hilarious.  Mine have been calling me a  quot NAZI Snowflake quot  like what is that a frozen swastika   To be honest  I don t see why people still use Twitter.   People who love to smell their own farts go on twitter because they can virtue signal and get their balls fondled by similarly minded buffoons. Anyone happy with their life doesn  39 t need Twitter.  Kinda like how we suckle on each other  39 s balls here    Fair point. I think we are a bit more open to others ideas though  and maybe their farts too       South Park episode comes to mind      At least myspace was fun with how you could customize your page. I only have Facebook because every time I turn it off my family  39 s freaks out.  I have never seen positive news story about someones tweet.   Brings out the worst in the worst people   The fact that twitter and Facebook have become tech versions of Banana Republics is quite fascinating and damning. Not too long ago Zuckerberg was imploring that Facebook shouldn t be the arbiter of truth. But these guys are at the behest of their far left employees  the impacts of which are going to be destructive in the long run.  That  39 s what I call a good start. The reality is though  they  39 ll probably bounce back within a few weeks.  Not sure. Twitter was declining before and Trump legit saved them.  That s the grand irony in all of this. Twitter wasn t on life support necessarily  but they were very clearly on the decline and maybe the inevitable path to death before Trump. He nearly single handedly revived the platform with his presidency. Similar can be said about CNN and MSNBC too.  Those nitwits don  39 t look at it that way. All they think is  quot Orange Man quot  bad without any regard to their bottom line. I  39 d be pissed if I was a shareholder.  The shareholders are pissed. That  39 s why it  39 s dropping  haha.  Even if it didn  39 t Dorsey et al don  39 t give a fuck.  It could drop 25  and they would still think it  39 s worth it.  Maybe 50  would get them a bit upset  but I wouldn  39 t even bet on that.  Hell yeah lose another 5 billion. While you are at it take farcebook  with you.  Jack better hope Republicans never retake government  or he  39 s in for a bad time.  With Dominion we won  39 t  The platform should have been long dead.  Keep it going  These companies aren t subject to being elected or removed from office  you have to vote on them with your time and money. Every second you spend on their app is the fuel that keeps them in power.  Despite everything that has happened recently  I still initially read this as  quot after company banned tramp. quot   Kylo Ren   em MORE  MORE   em

Whilst complaining about racial equity  and the dangers of gentrification while in front of a Trader Joe s.  I told a few family members of mine that I don  39 t take people  39 s skin color into consideration when I   You re definitely not contributing to racism  Appreciating their possible cultural observations and experiences is part of the friendship  but you wouldn t find that out until you re friends  so how is that ignorant   I have no clue.  I have tried understanding their perspective before.  They also claim that you can  39 t be racist or say racist things towards white people  because  quot White people make up the majority of the population  and have more systemic power over other races. quot   Sadly ive given up on many people i grew up with. Its simple they are extremists and are no longer friends.  They are enemies of freedom and the American way of life.  My guy  with this much effort to prove you re not racist  this sounds like you have one of two things happening    The conversation started after I told them I disagreed with many things that my Democrat colleagues have been saying recently.    Ahh I missed one  Their world is full of such ironies.  Then doom troops through a whole foods.   quot Fuck Capitalism  quot   he types from his iPhone 12 pro  while munching on the bag of Doritos he purchased earlier from the local 711.   And then tweets  Twitter is a private company  They can do what they want    I m truly convinced that liberals don t actually know what they are advocating for. They just go along with what s  trendy  or what they think makes them look virtuous.  Absolutely. Watch a few of those videos with Will Witt interviewing two or more liberals. The first thing they do is look at each other to make sure they aren  39 t speaking against the party. Or with Steven Crowder  39 s Change My Mind videos. Once they are outside their echo chambers and aren  39 t being spoonfed their beliefs  their arguments fall apart.  They are now protesting against protests.  Lol  Their justification is truly stupid when you see what was said and what happened. You compare the crap that was spewed prior and after all those protests all summer and the hypocrisy is so thick it kills when it lands. They don t care. Granted  we didn t move to use government to corral big tech  and big tech is leftist. Our own principles have brought us to our knees. They re cheering on the destruction and isolation of us because they see us as problematic things. We aren t people to them.   Haha. Love the edit at the bottom.   We re gonna tax the rich  right rich guys     Pretty much the liberal  quot shop at whole foods organic non racist  section quot  of the city while complaining about Mexican gardeners  trash collector trucks  dump plumbers  dirty farmers and naive religious idiots who believe in a god.  Not to include Islam though  that  39 d be insensitive .  I love the anti religion   resistance take the left has. Because I bet they all ask mom and dad for Christmas presents every year.  I ve always struggled to link the over protectiveness surrounding Islam and the Marxist ideologies obsession which seem to follow the leftist liberal mindset.  It seems to me these are contradictions.  They think they are the resistance but really they are the death eaters.  That s what always made me laugh the whole resistance movement that was backed by celebrities  corporations and cheered on by a political party. The resistance where they could express their ideas 24 7 with no fear where they could march and burn and no authorities came down on them. That was their grand resistance lmao. No no what you are seeing is the beginning of the real resistance one where the enemy is big powerful and full of people screaming for it to use its authority with blood and vinegar  Of all the abilities and traits those on the Left lack  self awareness might be at the top of the list.

t3_kvgo90,Bill Belichick declines to accept Presidential Medal of Freedom,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvgo90/bill_belichick_declines_to_accept_presidential/,Why the fuck are the giving the Presidential Medal of Freedom to a football coach   I have no problem with it  if it is treated like the civilian version of the Congressional Medal of Honor. Basically an award given for outstanding heroism. The problem is that it is a meaningless trinket given to whoever a president feels like giving it to.   an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States  world peace  cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.   That letter seems to be a harsh rebuke of Trump without even mentioning Trump by name.  Give it to Thomas Sowell instead  Absolutely. Dudes a genius.  Here  here. Long overdue.  He should have 3 of them already  This is the part of the letter where I stopped believing that he wrote it.  It really makes ya wanna puke  doesn  39 t it  I can  39 t find the words to describe the level of disgust this brings me.  I thought tensions were rising prior to trump  39 s tenure. The topic was beyond whoever the president was.  Probably because he doesn t own a suit  Lol funny line. BB actually wants to wear suits on the sideline. NFL forbids it  and makes them wear team apparel. Sleeveless hoodie is BB s ridiculous protest outfit. Still a funny line.  He does but the sleeves are cut out. Probably not proper WH attire.  Sad. If Biden or Obama gave me a medal of freedom I would take it in a heartbeat.   deleted   Well I don t think you have to worry about being considered bud   deleted   So brave.  Stunning and brave  I deserve it. Give it to me.  Trump should write him a Pardon for Spygate  Wow    A cheater with morals   Good for you Bill   you scumbag  I don  39 t care.  You re nothing without Brady  old man.  I always wonder if he regrets letting Brady go. Apparently neither Brady nor Gronk actually liked Belichick that much.  Accurate statement right here.  Yes a thousand times.  And why would he get this medal anyway.  He made so much money from the Patriots but fails to be one.  Well he was always a liar and cheater anyways  so I guess siding with the Social Justice people suits him.  Can t tell if this is another lib brigade or there s lots of patriots fans here  Why not both   Isn t he the director of the original spy gate anyways   He scared  after the kneeling crap and pandering football people ...  Between him and  Tompa Tom  I m really pissed at myself for the Sunday s I wasted for 18 years.  Cmon  man. Every asshole at this point is too scared for their own hide to do anything that would seem unifying  This was a survival move not a political one. If accepted that medal there is a 100  chance he would be physically assaulted by his players the next time they see him  Not belichick. He s one cold motherfucker.  Ahhh wish he would have accepted it  oh well here  39 s to hopefully a better season next year lol  Makes sense considering the media is making anyone who even agrees with Trump at all on anything is an automatic far right terrorist this past week   deleted   Wow the greatest coach in NFL history is scared to accept the award because of what his players would think. Bunch of entitled cry babies getting paid to play a game for a living but lecture the public like they have it so hard  Gisele must have given him a call  He  39 s scared to death of his players. He wants to stay in the league and he  39 s too much of a punk to stand up for himself.  So brave of him.  Not Bill the douche   deleted   That was four years ago though. Bill may have accepted it if last week didn  39 t happen  maybe not.  But after last week  whether you think Trump is at any fault at all  it  39 s easy to see even Bill reject this.  Maybe he didn  39 t think Trump lived up to being a leader he once thought he was.  I know  to me  he didn  39 t.  I voted twice for him but as a leader he fell way short imo  If this is a conservative sub and I only see flaired users commenting what s with all the down votes  Never mind I see it s the Pats fans doing the downvoting because them peeps talking trash about Bill.  It s also the lefties who have nothing better to do with their lives than brigade a sub that doesn t agree with them 24 7

Might be an  quot idea quot  according to him...  Something something context  our internal team decided the context didn t go against our rules.  I can tell you where he was   he was cheering them on.  Donating millions to them no less.  Just being the despicable person he is.  You re going to be his next target Kelley if something isn t done soon  Conservatives need to stop playing into their game and being oblivious. There s a stupid idea where everyone calls out hypocrisy thinking it ll result in things changing.  I ve never seen it work.  This dude looks like a prisoner of war. Zuckerberg looks like the douche he s always been but I feel like Dorsey is being blackmailed or tortured or something.   He  39 s Woke Rasputin. The voice of God in his head is distracting him from what  39 s actually happening around him    Nah  he  39 s fine. Yeah  there might be a hand up is rear helping him with his speaking points but that  39 s no different than Biden.  At what point can they drop the facade that Twitter  39 s censorship has anything to do with   39 inciting violence  39     39 hacked materials  39   and the like   I personally hope Parler s lawsuit  or another lawsuit against Twitter  reaches the Supreme Court. Big Tech needs to be reminded by the highest court in the land that free speech is not to be infringed upon.  I was disappointed to see that Rand Paul voted with the Democrats on the 6th even though he seemed like he was saying he  39 d do otherwise leading up to that vote.

Don  39 t worry they will continue to alienate more and more people.  This is true. Two of my conservative friends are married to democrats  split households if you will . Their spouses are already angered that their husbands are being depicted as terrorists for supporting trump and speaking out against election fraud. A lot of moderates   fence sitters   and even  quot light blue quot  democrats are looking at this with an eyebrow raised high.   deleted   If the Democrats  moderate  allow the extremes of the party to take control they will lose the house  senate and presidency in the next four years and they will do this  they cannot help themselves  the AOC  39 s and other extremists are going to force Nancy Pelosi out this year. When Nancy is forced out its gonna be open season for these extremists and their policies.  If you actually believe the voting isn t rigged  then they will lose control.  I think as long as we can get states to put the kabosh on large scale main in voting then there is a fighting chance. Fraud becomes even harder to do and any attempts would be more easily discovered  Except all those instances with video evidence of ballots being re scanned  altered  etc. Polling places need some serious security upgrades too  Good hopefully they realize their stupid leftist ideals are as dangerous a they where in the 30s.  More  walkaway the better   quot Your speech is violence   our violence is speech quot   But violence in the name of manufactured racial justice is ok don t you know by now   They really see themselves as Civil Rights leaders in an era of injustice.

Looks like foriegn policy saber rattling to me.  Liberal privilege  being able to express your political viewpoint publicly without fear of retaliation.  So what are we going to do about it   Media and big tech dictionary    We should all really stop holding Twitter to their own standards.  Exactly  it is like acting shocked that the CCP doesn  39 t actually grant any of the rights in their constitution.  Or that North Korea is not democratic.  I mean yeah tons of news outlets where excusing the violence they even used MLKs quote to do so. Not just media outlets but plenty of celebrities and politicians encouraged it as well.  Its a threat to our democracy.  If the left didn t have double standards then they wouldn t have any standards at all.  The laughable thing is that the Democrats don  39 t realise how badly they are being played. The people fomenting unrest aren  39 t for any party. They are hoping that America will disintegrate politically and corporations will take over. They already are.  I can  39 t wait to show the jack boots how peaceful I am when they come for my AR15. I  39 ll even be courteous enough to give them my ammo first.  They keep pushing as far as they  39 re allowed to go in an effort to spark a civil war. Make no mistake  there are people who can  39 t wait for it to happen and are itching to kill their political adversaries.  Textbook definition of promoting violence right here  Let  39 s just keep reminding them of all the people they forgot.  I  39 m sure   Jackoff is coming up with lies as we speak.

t3_kv2ej5,House Amazon Facebook Apple Google have monopoly power should be split,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv2ej5/house_amazon_facebook_apple_google_have_monopoly/,I  39 m glad someone said it  though there  39 s no one with the backbone to carry it through.  Apple should definitely be included with those 2.  Is apple a monopoly  I mean  they re a really good company but they re not even in control of the market share of their respective fields.  They hold a monopoly on app stores on their phones. You cannot install 3rd party apps.  Yeah  but you don  39 t have to buy their phones  Apple and Google colluded to remove Parler. That means they engaged in anticompetitive business practices  This right here. You really only have two choices android of iphone. If they work together like this that means there is no third option. Interesting enough samsung might join in the attack on google they have been having a silent wore for a while. Google wouldnt let samsung put their own apps on their own phones for a bit.  Google basic threatened to not let them use anything google if they did.  Exactly  There is not elsewhere to go to.  I  39 m not disagreeing with that  I  39 m saying it isn  39 t an argument that holds any ground to call Apple a monopoly. Because that practice is part of the reason people buy their products  for the enforced security of what you can download. A case can definitely be made for Google in my opinion  but we  39 ve already tried that in the past few months and their lawyers literally just said   quot you can use other search engines and services quot  and that was good enough apparently. So the case against Apple is not strong when it is especially easy to avoid their products entirely.  I m not saying  monopoly . Apple Google violated antitrust and tortuous interference law.   removed   This article was written 10 7 2020. The dangers it describes are made all the more clear by recent events regarding Parler. Antitrust action must be taken.  yep  Net Neutrality was a ploy so the fiber providers couldn  39 t have any leverage over the Tech Cartels    who operate in servers  software  and services.  This is what I find so funny about big tech s response. Many on the left already wanted to split them up. Even though the reasoning behind both sides are massively different  they just made the desire to split them up bipartisan supported issue.  Split them into what  A whole bunch of smaller organizations that deplatform conservatives   Won  39 t it just end up like AT amp T   Whole bunch of smaller  shittier companies that fail and get bought back up by the largest one until it  39 s a monopoly again.  If they are competing with each other that is less likely to occur  unless they collude  which is also a violation of law .  Parler should not have been able to be  quot disappeared quot .  A bunch of smaller companies who are forbidden by threat of sanction for sharing or in any way appearing to coordinate their decisions about who gets to do business in the market.  So just continue on getting conservative platforms erased   Also racketeering and conspiracy   Hard to argue otherwise. Hell  the only counterpoint I can think of is  quot well  they  39 re helping our side out by doing it so it  39 s ok quot .   Until the tech companies come for the Dems. Eventually there will be another group that will want power.  If you are able to silence the president of the US  yeah   that  39 s bit too much power.  Amazon shouldn  39 t hold server services for other online companies or government agencies.  I guarantee you this doesn  39 t happen under a blue wave.  If only the Senate was still in power of the Republicans...  Who s to say Mitch would even consider voting on it  Dude was so out of touch with what the base wants he basically single handedly torpedoed any chance of keeping the senate.  Yup we need to clean house ourselves before we have any chance against the Dems.  Nothing will be done until Big Tech starts limiting anti tech voices from the left. All of a sudden the dems will realise that big tech is not their friend.  Bring back anti trust laws  I want a trust buster in office.  Teddy Roosevelt  gt  Ronald Reagan. Fight me.  YES PLEASE  Claims of monopoly power are legally dubious but there is a clear collusion racketeering case to be made based on the way Apple  Google  and Amazon colluded to help Twitter destroy an up and coming competitor in Parler.  Isn  39 t it sad that these Big Tech companies are tone deaf   half of your market doesn  39 t share your political views so you  39 re going to shut them out  Not a real smart business practice   especially in a country founded on personal Liberty.  Ironically. The democrats will likely do this. I think big tech hoped by squashing conservatives they won t but I don t think it will work  This was warned about long ago  though I  39 m glad it  39 s finally being given the attention it deserves. If you want to utterly destroy democracy this is how you do it  consolidate all technological prowess to three left leaning tech giants.  Democrats head that committee as they were majority in the House.  Now that was in their favor and they are in office it won  39 t seem so bad to them.  I don  39 t know if that will solve the main problem  censorship. They shouldn  39 t be punished financially for allowing free speech and should be legally prevented from censoring people. For example people are not boycotting Xfinity for allowing communication that they don  39 t agree with and it doesn  39 t audit our phone calls.  These companies didn  39 t donate billions of dollars to a party that would separate them.

Not your Audible subscriptions  not your male pattern baldness treatments  not your electric toothbrush mail order service.   Great assessment. You can say the same for Facebook and reddit as well.  Private companies have the right to do business their way.  They also have the right to fail  so get fucked  Twitter.  These companies only exist because of the governments gift of section 230.

If Parler is a risk then the Internet police have a lot of work ahead of them if they wish to clean up the net.  They only wish to clean up the conservatives  you know   re educate  us.   strong Leftists believe free speech IS a risk to public safety.  strong   This is the pre emptive assault on free speech. Joe Biden has a whole bag of assault on free speech with our names on it  Joe Biden has made numerous comments on speech restrictions.   Parler represents a deep fear that someone other than Democrats and the elite could give a voice to a revolution. And it  39 s about the money.  What was  quot unique quot  about Parler was being unwilling to hand your data over to Google surveillance products and join ranks with Twitter  Facebook  Apple  Google  and Amazon over  quot deplatforming quot  President Donald J Trump from the Internet. All other companies with significant reach and belief in free speech were willing to sell out to the Tech Cartel due to threats or bribes.  I wouldn t be so sure... looks like their site was operated by people that didn t know what they were doing so now all content is going to be dumped on the public internet.  a href  https   twitter.com donk enby status 1348281459031814146 s 21  https   twitter.com donk enby status 1348281459031814146 s 21  a   Nope. One of their security vendors dumped them  complying with Cartel signals from Apple  Google  and Amazon  and then disclosed information publicly to expose the breach they  39 d created by suddenly dropping Parler.  This one really bothers me. Parler is  still hopefully  on it  39 s way to becoming a commonly known as used social media platform with free speech as a focus. I don  39 t mean to offend other well intended attempts but most other attempted end up only being used by fringe groups like white supremacists and neo nazis. Parler has been different. Many influential people have verified accounts there and some serious investment has been put into the site. It  39 s growth and popularity are big techs main motivations for shutting it down.  Its dead in the water now. Amazon shut them off this morning.  They are trying to rebuild the site and have it hosted elsewhere  but yeah it isn  39 t looking good atm.  Yep Parler was the only social media alternative ive ever heard someone talk about in real life  off line  Arab spring  et al  organized through social media   good  Its weird how they fixate on certain things but totally ignore others  what makes Parler more special than Gab or even 4chan  which is arguably worse  what makes the Proud Boys so special but not Identity Evropa    This crap is really getting crazy.  Nothing funny about all users of Parler being censored over a bunch of made up bs  Reported tonight that of the people arrested at the capital so far  Facebook was used to coordinate not Parler  Facebook has been used to perpetuate violence on Many occasions. Oh the hypocrisy  Source please.  This is great info.  The FBI can handle any actual organization of violence from Parler. Big tech is not wanted nor needed in this area  yet they are pretending as if they are being virtuous as they crush potential competition while they collude together.  Anything the government claims is done to protect the public is bullshit  like  quot public health quot  to justify medical tyranny.  Oh Rlllllllyy

t3_kv16dw,60 Minutes Reporter to Nancy Pelosi Lady You Obstructed a COVID Relief Bill for Eight MonthsOwn It.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv16dw/60_minutes_reporter_to_nancy_pelosi_lady_you/,I have coworkers who believe Pelosi is a hero who tried relentlessly to pass the relief bill  but the GOP blocked it at every turn.   That  39 s especially awful considering Pelosi herself admits she didn  39 t get it passed  I mean  Mitch fucked it up the last time  but for months leading up to the election Pelosi refused to put forth anything that wasn  39 t a trillion dollar mess.  Not 1 trillion but I believe it was 3.1 trillion. She went LONG on covid  And there was a lot of money that was going to bail out states with dumas governors  like California and New York.  Got a feeling the stimulus they push through on 1 21 will probably be in the  6T range  It should have been a stand alone bill not in the omnibus but Mitch did fuck everyone on it.  And never forget the first round of checks was tied to legislation mandating vote by mail.  Yeah I don t doubt Mitch is equally as corrupt and awful  but for this instance there s a difference between not wanting to provide people more relief and blocking it and intentionally letting people suffer to use for an election. That s some psychopathic shit.  She should have pulled a Harry Reid.  When he got called out on putting out the lie that Mitt Romney hadn  39 t paid taxes in 10 years  after the election he just shrugged and said   quot It worked  didn  39 t it  quot .  Same thing here.  The tactic worked and they completely got away with it.  I remember that and you have to almost admire the honesty. If anything  this shows how pathetic Mitt Romney is for cowering to those that treated him so viciously.  I can  39 t stand Obama or his presidency  but knowing Romney now I  39 m actually glad he lost...  Tbh  I think Mitch just doesn t want the work that comes with being Majority leader.  He is relatively old and has another 6 more years left in his term.  I imagine he wants to keep the benefits afforded to him by his position but doesn t want the extra work.  It s really sad b c the only group hurt by this are the American people.  The same goes for Nancy  Chuck  and all the other old school politicians currently in office.  Yeah i have friends that think trump is awful yet pelosi would be a good president and cuomo has done a great job. it  39 s sick.  Cuomo has done a great job if his goal was to murder nursing home patients and  em not  em  distribute the vaccine  while winning an Emmy.  Awomen  I think what might finally wake them up is the attacks coming on Mandalorian for luke and his toxic masculinity and cobra kai for it  39 s whiteness  perhaps when it finally hits something they care about they  39 ll realize.  No they won t. They ll convince themselves that they hated those things once it becomes cool to do so. They have no independent thought.         Even worse than sheep. More like lemmings.  They won  39 t wake up. They  39 ll be like Aunt Lydia continuing to use the cattle prod even after she  39 s been stabbed.  Well if Cuomp was president  we wouldn  39 t worry about our elderly relatives getting sick  because they would all be dead.  Pandemic solved.  Yep. Media narrative is powerful.  well it  39 s only us that sees the media as untrustworthy  the left  many of my friends  think trump has brainwashed us to not trust the media becuase he  39 s a nazi.   Bernie echoed those sentiments.  The crazy thing is that not even CNN and NBC are pushing that narrative. Wolf Blitzer even famously grilled her a few months ago over her obstructions to federal aid. She was simply there to prevent the Trump administration from accomplishing anything positive.  a href  https   m.youtube.com watch v gqPltMpWIwo  https   m.youtube.com watch v gqPltMpWIwo  a    I mean look at Cuomo. He s doing an astronomically bad job at handling covid and he s being lauded.  These people are all over reddit. It  39 s insane.  The media is going to try and pretend they  39 re playing hardball with the Dems for just a little while. They always do this  quot fight quot  after they pretended nothing was going on. See the Hunter Biden scandal. That was Russia until it was true.  I hear  quot Trump blocked covid relief all year  Trump didn  39 t want 1000 each  Hitler  quot .          I have legitimately encountered this on popular non political subs. It s so frustrating. Need we remind them that Pelosi s bill required extremely absurd stipulations such as    Not saying that the spending isn t dumb or at least worth examining  but that was just the basic spending bill to which the covid relief was attached. The real question is why the GOP was just going to pass all of that without a fight  The answer  of course  is that the legislature is totally broken and they don t vote on anything individually anymore. They each just approve each others  pet projects on the dime of the taxpayer.  Every piece of legislation should be a   39 clean bill  39 .  Any major bill the pass now is full of BS provisions and enough pork to feed the cities of Cleveland and Atlanta for a year.  I  39 m not against all of those points  but goddamn why did that shit have to be on a relief bill for the people  Speaker   Well can you blame them  How else are people supposed to get news other than the news  Once most of the countries media stops being agenda free it  39 s fucked. It  39 s no better then having state controlled media.  That s funny   Most people I know who are neutral on Pelosi don t follow politics.  Idk anyone who follows her and likes her   It  39 s because she never admits what she did  republicans will say  quot yes we held up the bill because of major amounts of wasteful spending quot  while Pelosi just says  quot nope  never held it up  not ever  I  39 ve never held it up quot  if she was truthful and would actually admit that she did and why she wouldn  39 t be speaker  Way too late to try being reporters now.  Trump is out of the way and now they will continue to dismiss people in order until big mama Kamala is left with big tech and the ccp  She refuses to own it  and the interviewer barely pushes the issue.  I mean  come on  man  Just wait til CornPop gets ahold of ya  Ya danged dog faced pony soldier   I got hairy legs.  Listen  fat. Wanna do some push ups   CornPop always makes me laugh my ass off  After Jan 20 let see who will become the new villain.  I don  39 t think they can afford to find a new villain. It  39 s gonna be Trump  that  39 s why they  39 re trying to goad him so much right now.   Look at what they did to Sandmann and how much they were worked into frenzy over him. They still despise that that kid to this day. They have no trouble creating villains.  It will still be Trump just like everything was still Bush  39 s fault during Obama  39 s run.  Man  the way they  seamlessly transitioned from running themselves ragged talking shit about Bush  to absolutely kissing Obama  39 s ass is one of the first big things that made me stop trusting the news media. I know Dubya said some goofy shit  but it was blatantly unprofessional and really made me see who owns them.  Most of the early flak seems to be headed in McConnell  39 s direction.  Nah it s Cruz first  Oh they  39 ll be caught up on Trump for a while  Republicans in Congress will get to duck the media machine for a little while longer.  Us.  quot Domestic terrorists quot  who have a different tax policy than the Democrats.  Not a lot of follow up from Leslie Stahl there. Softball the question in and let Pelosi hit all her  quot it was the Republicans fault quot  talking points.  Really sick of that fucking gasbag of a woman  I don  39 t care if you are left  right  up  down  black  white or purple  a  D    R    L    G  or  I ... We all need to agree in this nation that senators and representatives seriously need term limits.  And age limits. With how fast technology changes and the world changes  you can t have people at 80 years old who can hardly operate a simple iPhone running the country  I think setting term limits would help to solve that problem too though  because the only way you get to be that goddamned old in politics is by having a death grip onto your seat for decades and decades. I don  39 t think you see too many 70 year old 1st term congressmen and senators.   Biden is going in a year older than Trump is leaving. And Biden says he wants 2 terms  what he wants and what he gets will likely be different  but the man is saying he still wants to be president at 86 years old. 86.   And the fact that she  39 s lasted so long in Washington says a lot.  No one like her  or Maxine Waters  should be a politician or have the powers they have. They  39 re horrible people.  Only reason she is still in office is because  R  doesn t exist in California   R  exists in California  but sure as fuck not in Nancy Pelosi  39 s congressional district.  There are millions of Republicans in California  but cities like LA and San Francisco have such a stranglehold on the state that it s rare for a Republican to ever be elected to a state office.  Im doing my part   Too little too late for objectivity and honesty with the media. They shown their bias when they kept bashing Trump...  I have to admit I am impressed with just how far Nancy Pelosi is willing to take her bullshit.  I have seen five and six year olds that can spin a lie for hours and hours and even they eventually come back around  but Nancy is on another level of lying.  It  39 s easy to lie when you never get called out  It  39 s starting to make sense why they keep focusing on Trump  even with a freaking week left. They need that irrational hatred to take the focus off of themselves.  Lol no way. They  39 ll push the  quot well Trump created this mess. We will need time to fix it. quot  BS narrative.  They both accumulated the power they had have through media.  It  39 s a truly powerful weapon.  Fascism  a political philosophy  movement  or regime  such as that of the Fascisti  that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader  severe economic and social regimentation  and forcible suppression of opposition.  Nancy Pelosi is an elder lich.  I watched the beginning of the 60 Minutes interview last night  and while I vehemently disagree with the violence at the Capital  she made it sound so harrowing  yet the worst she could point out was a broken mirror and selfies with shoes on her desk.    She was probably briefed that we are going to have to ask you a tough question but it will be mostly how bad Trump is.   IT WAS THE REPUBLICANS FAAAAAAAAULT    Nice to see this from 60 minutes.  It was real satisfying. Wish it happened more frequently  funny how they weren  39 t willing to call her out on that BEFORE the  election.  Don t worry Nancy. This will die in darkness and your faithful followers will tune out the inconvenient truths revealed in this interview.  How long before that reporter  quot retires quot    The reporter is playing the role of controlled opposition. She  39 ll ask the question as  quot proof quot  of her impartiality  then spend the rest of her time subtly pushing people toward corrupt politicians.  The fact that it isn  39 t common knowledge that The democrats did this speaks to how much of a grasp the media has on us. There were multiple days when Republicans showed a complete willingness to compromise  trump offered multiple times to sign any stimulus package that was passed  literally the Republicans only standard was that it wasn  39 t 5000 pages long and filled with foreign aid. Passed that we were willing to put up with however much they wanted  we even let them bail out they  39 re own states if it meant actually getting something passed.  Friend of mine is a direct relative of Pelosi  1  I watched most of the interview and it  39 s just a bunch of pearl clutching about  quot terrorism quot  but only because it  39 s against them.  They also say  quot American democracy is under siege quot    by wanting votes counted properly  democracy is under siege.  These two hags are insane if you watch it  I don  39 t understand why either side held it up.  If they couldn  39 t agree on a bunch of the details they should have passed a one line bill and then argued for 8 months over everything else in a seperate bill.   quot  1200 to every Adult American quot .  She won  39 t...and she won  39 t have to either.  The gaslighting from this one is intolerable.  So now that the presidential race is no longer in dispute  the far Left media can pretend like they  39 re objective again. Not buying it  buddy   So thats another reporter giving up there twitter account  The house wrote  passed  and handed over a covid relief bill to the senate.   Journalism died about 4 years ago.  That was a softball question teed up so Pelosi could have the opportunity to spout nonsense about how it was all the Republicans  fault. She wasn t really being called out for anything.  I  39 m suprised she just didn  39 t quote Harry Reid  since she  39 s apparently bulletproof politically with her  5 media armor of gaslighting  So air this after the Georgia Senate run off and everyone blames the Republicans  I see.  This woman has the gall to suggest Trump staged a coup when she tried to get the pentagon to stop following Trump s orders over the weekend.  She seemed nervous during this interview what a old hag   It was watching an actual reporter talk to a child.  This is what I want to see more of in the coming years. I want to see all politicians held to the same standards. The fact that Pelosi and Schumer have the gall to act like good guys here is maddening. The people who went to the rally rioted were sick of being made to feel lesser by these elites.  About fucking time these  quot reporters quot  actually did their jobs  I think Pelosi should be impeached.  She has gone crazy.  She tried to force Pence into invoking the 25th Amendment.  There are 9 days until Trump leaves office and she pulls BS like that   That is insane.  Her  tell    look away   increased blinking.  And despite this her party got  quot elected quot . They can do pretty much anything they want because the media covers them at every corner. But a Rep ties a single windsor on his tie instead of a double  IMPEACH   Did they eventually talk about her breaking lockdown rules in her own state 
t3_kuz3pk,Twitter drops over 8 premarket after Trump ban,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuz3pk/twitter_drops_over_8_premarket_after_trump_ban/,Keep uninstalling lads  Done two days ago.   quot Sorry to see you go.  GoodBye quot   That  39 s a great hastag.  Been gone since they began censoring free speech. Can t even address concerns without being told you re wrong.  Why were you even using the Twitter before then   I was never on Twitter to begin with but would occasionally click links to  quot news quot  posted on Twitter  whose format is awful and makes it difficult to follow what is going on . I no longer click anything linking to Twitter.  I mainly used it to see what the President was tweeting but uninstalled it this weekend when he got banned suspended or whatever  I didn t. I hardly used myself but read sometimes. And many links was to Twitter. I was also working with social media but mostly with videos.  I can  39 t believe any one permitted that trash on their phone anyway.  So...slight problem. I don t remember my password for Twitter  lol.  I m going to have to reset my password just to deactivate my account.  Shouldn  39 t be a problem at all.  It  39 s worth it. Do it.vthis needs to hurt them. Bad  I doubt deleting my unused account will do any damage. Like using a pistol against Galactus.  It has more potential damage than doing nothing.  It depends how they count users. The bigger the hit in deactivated accounts the better for everyone. One of the only tools we have at the moment is things like this. It has to hurt them or else they will see it as a sign that most of the country is fine with it and that censorship is ok.  11.5  now  don  39 t just uninstall  be sure to deactive your account.  Just did both  Fuck Twitter     I hope there  39 s a mass exodus of people from Twitter and that it  39 s primarily people who work and actually afford things  such that advertisers see how little gain there is on their platform     I made my account in the spring of 2009.  Permanently deleted last night.  My account was made some many years ago. I barely used it.... I deactivated it as soon as I heard about the ban.  The real question is why did anyone have Twitter beforehand   To follow President Trump           He  39 ll just take the company private buying back the low priced shares. Jack doesn  39 t work for the shareholders. He doesn  39 t work for the users. He works for the people that buy your user data and pay him to control what is and isn  39 t promoted   like the Chinese Communist Party.  To get news faster from independent journalists and keep up with creators in hobbies i enjoy. Its not all politics.  I never got Twitter.  I thought about getting it but I spend to much time on my phone as it is.  That and now I  39 m learning more about who runs that platform and I  39 m not impressed to say the least.  I do like to follow Elon and Snowden though. How else can you follow them  Suggestions   Years ago I was able to view Twitter on the web without the app.  Just can  39 t like or comment.  Hmmm. Wonder if I can set up alerts for that too. Good idea. Thanks   Be sure to use Ublock origin extension so they don t get any ad money  Okay I ll have to research that    I straight up deleted my decade old account.   Make sure to 1 star review first  Haha just looked under most recent reviews. It has a shit ton of 1 star reviews  Done   Just deactivated my 11 yr old account and uninstalled    Actually dont forget to deactivate your accounts before you leave  Hasn  39 t been installed in more than four years. The same as Facebook.  Do they even know care if it  39 s installed   Twitter seems to care more about politics than business.  The CEO and billionaires at Twitter do I  39 m sure. But if I was a working man stock holder and I just saw 8  of my investment go poof to elect a man who wants to raise capital gains tax from 21  to 40 .... I  39 d be furious.  You don  39 t have to pay capital gains tax if you don  39 t make any capital gains  em taps head  em   Ha  Brilliant  Modern problem  meet modern solution.  I think the board members have opened themselves up to a lawsuit for not acting in the shareholders best interests.  It certainly appears they  39 ve ignored their fiduciary responsibility.  The defense they ll use is the same one they ll use to go after all of us  danger.  There  39 s still fiduciary responsibility. They can preach danger all they want  but stockholders only care about profits. Last time I checked being  quot woke quot  doesn  39 t provide profits...but quite the opposite.  Would keeping Trump s account up be seen as best interests  I m wondering if the cancel culture mob cancelling Twitter if they didn t suspend Trump would have been more damaging. This is why every social network except Twitter banned Alex Jones  and then there was an awkward spotlight on them so they shrugged it off saying how he didn t do anything wrong but then magically made up a reason to ban him just days afterwards. This is why I don t think these social media companies are in direct communication  but they just see in which direction the winds are blowing. In other words if you re at Twitter and you see Facebook and Google YouTube deplatforming someone then you follow suit.  They admitted at the Senate hearings after Cruz  amp  CO got the name of the apps  big tech shares information  coordinate banning over all platforms  etc. Cruz actually pulled out screenshots of the inter company info sharing apps.          Big brotherland  We  39 ve gone way beyond just big brother government now. Imagine if this was happening 20 years ago when the patriot act was being discussed.           link  I am curious  Youtube the Social media Senate hearings from like 2 months ago I think  Dorsey especially got grilled by Cruz who must have an inside whistleblower. PS dorsi is a snake and got caught in several lies.  Dorsey looks like a was recruited by ISIS recently. Of course he  39 s a snake. He  39 s a product of our government  ironically  just like ISIS.  I  39 d never seen him before  I thought it was a joke when this guy looking strikingly like the homeless guy who lives in a tent behind the gas station ended up being the Twitter CEO.  Part of Twitter  39 s valuation comes from active daily users and amount of daily activity.  Trump generated massive amounts of activity for Twitter. With him completely gone  that activity goes away.  Do you know about the proposed stockholder to stakeholder conversion  Globalists say valuations based on profits encourages companies not to do the right thing for society. It s complicated  but they want companies to be valued on how much  good  they do. This is a prime example.  Unless they share their politics or are pressured to share their politics.  Fingers crossed we  39 re both wrong.  They don  39 t care about money  it is the ideology that matters.  Lol you honestly think twitter cares more about ideology than their bottom line   Jack and the moderators of Twitter   Yes.  Yes Twitter is one of the least viable publishers out there for ad revenue.  It really is. Twitter ads are the worst of anything in social media. I have done digital and social for many years now and anyone who tells me that they spend ad money on Twitter I know immediately is an idiot.  Twitter was a semi dying platform  then Trump starter ranting on it and it got revived. Supposedly 40 50  of it  39 s active users had some amount of Trump interaction. We need to remember that these social media platforms have not stood the test of time  people are very fluid and will move to the next  quot hip quot  thing in an instant.  Dorsey is either getting racks from China or hoping he could become part of the dictatorship if they succeed to accomplish one  This. 90  of Twitter is a small week project by a competent full stack web programmer. They are replaceable. Like the NYT only path forward is as state sponsored or billionaire sponsored approved media and they know it  I remember pre Trump there was widespread talk about how Twitter was going to die because it had burned all the investor money and could not for the life of them show a profit.  Then Trump got in and made it his platform  which spiked traffic.  Yep. They killed their golden goose... Anyone notice how leftists don  39 t seem to have paid attention to their fairy tales  Crying wolf is a daily occurrence.  They are banking on being the only govt approved platform after the coup is complete.  Seems they are well on their way to that goal.  Apparently Twitter wants to stop being a private business and become a government propaganda distribution agency  I mean authority over the narrative is definitely worth something.  Their business is selling the mined data of the non customers  Twitter Users  and messaging control  boosting  deboosting  curated trending  shadowbans  and blacklists  to their real customers  Chinese Communist Party  global multi national corporations  politicians  etc. .  That s still not even close to its 2015 2016 lows. Would need to lose closer to 50  to get into that territory.  Give it some time.  Turn this into another Gillette  they had to lose  8 billion after stupidly claiming there was an issue with masculinity and it was toxic. Which was false  masculinity isn  39 t toxic  those scumbags were trying to belittle and criticize men who made up a majority of their user base.  As long as another brand is available I refuse to buy Gillette.  Switch to the more refined safety razors. There are so many great blades to try  and there  39 s one for every face. I made the switch a while back and never looked back.  0.10  0.30 per razor  nicer shave and the blade doesn  39 t get clogged up every stroke. Even my wife switched to using one.  I bought one of the old style 2 sided safety razors with replaceable 2 sided blades. The replacement blades only cost about  20 for a pack of 100. I only shave twice a week and each blade is good for several shaves so after 4 years I  39 m not even halfway through my  20 pack of blades lol  Gentleman  get civilized. Buy a real straight razor and a piece of leather for stropping it with.             I did the same thing   Don  39 t bother will Dollar Shave Club  they  39 ve donated quite a bit of cash to the terrorist groups BLM  amp  Antifa.  Also their blades are trash.  I  39 ve been using Schick  great product and not expensive.  Did they fire anybody over this   No but the CEO resigned and they took an  8 billion write down.  CEO  quot resigned quot   I didn  39 t see anyone else taking a personal hit from what I read...  That  39 s cool  the CEO had to have signed it off.   Down 11  at 9 33 am EST   Yea  but I hate these posts.  More please  Hopefully it keeps on tumbling down.  And it  39 s not all tech.  QQQ moving in the complete opposite direction the last 5 days.  Yeah there  39 s no way to argue this isn  39 t because of banning Trump.  It  39 s won  39 t  it  39 s already gained 2  back.  Big tech didnt even wait for Trump to be out of office to go full ussr censorship of conservatives.  Not enough.  It s amazing.   Puts on Twitter   easy tendies  IV is already too high  Disabled my account over the weekend.  Don  39 t miss it  didn  39 t really use it anyway.  not enough  hopefully 80  by the end of the week  We know it realistically won  39 t go that low. Especially this week.  This is just the start.  The Biden administration will administer the coup de grace.  It is still doing much better than DJIA after pre covid times. Let  39 s hope it plunges 50  more one hour twenty minutes  This is how you kill social media. You LEAVE  Who knew that when you alienate a huge part of the population your business suffers..  Honestly  I wouldn  39 t say they  39 re really suffering. It  39 s just another average red day in the market.  Don  39 t watch twitters stock today. Waitfor their next earnings report.  They can hide the damage into then  DEACTIVATE YOUR TWITTER BEFORE YOU UNINSTALL IT PLS    And let Twitter know your reason why  Down 12  now.  This isn  39 t really a big deal it will be normal again in like 2 weeks  Twitter has confused their purpose. As a company they  39 re there to make money  not to be SJW.  It s not like conservative voices can go elsewhere right now  Along with Twitter  Apple  Amazon  and Google stock should also be sold. There could be anti trust issues as they conspired against a competitor.  They have committed suicide by their un american caving to these power hungry leftists  The entire market is down. This is probably correlation not equalling causation.  Yeah every stock is trending down today.  Breach of fiduciary duty to the shareholders  they should take action.  Dack Jorsey needs to learn......  Always baffling to see a company who s struggled to pull their finances into the green absolutely tank their own share price while every other tech company is booming financially.  You absolutely love to see it  10ish  during trading   not enough for anyone over there to panic  and it will probably level out in a week or so.  10  of Twitter  39 s value is 2 billion dollars. Not time for them to shit the bed yet  but you can bet they are noticing.  Agreed   they better take notice  but for those of us who were hoping jack was going to get stomped today   it didn  39 t happen.  12  now  Deactivated today. Hope this company implodes.   deleted   I know one the most famous yesterday deleted all her photos  That s it  I would have expected much more.  12  now  Couldn t have happened to a nicer company.  Lol  their entire boom in value was because the literal most powerful person on the planet did 90  of his public communication through them. No one is going to be waiting on fucking Biden or Kamala  39 s every thought. Them banning him is just going to push more people off.  A major company like twitter doesn  39 t lose  2.5 billion in a week by accident. They are being compensated for this from somewhere else. My guess is they  39 re taking the short term hit in exchange for promises from democrats to protect them from anti trust suits.  Facebook is also down 2   Not only are Trump supporters in the US uninstalling. It s also people all around the world. Trump supporters aren t exclusive to the US  I find it funny when this sub tries to use short term stock prices to justify what ever political issue aligns with the conservative view point. If you look at twitters stock it was at the highest it s been since it s IPO. It was already trending slightly down but still higher than it was a month ago and will probably rise again shortly.  Dicks is dead  and twitter will be dead too.  If you got money in Twitter  sell now   I  39 m gonna be honest  that  39 s terrible stock advice. The news is already out and the drop was negligible at best. Unless more  quot news quot  comes out that may be damning toward the platform  it  39 s not going to bleed dry. It may go down a little bit over the next few days  but it  39 ll be back to where it was by next week or the week after.  It  39 s on us  now. The Dems are never going to hold big tech accountable while big tech is helping and covering for them.  What  39 s Twitter  Never bought one...  I  39 m seeing so many unflaired comment notifications of people thinking we  39 re whining about Trump being banned. This isn  39 t about him entirely. It  39 s a slippery slope of mass censorship and so many couldn  39 t care less about it. It happens to conservatives and people don  39 t care. It happens to some random social justice warrior and all of a sudden everyone comes to their defense. If all you see is Trump and not the big picture in all of this  then you  39 re sorely misguided.  Dump Twitter now  Leave it to all the whiny li  39 l bitches who want war with anyone who isn  39 t a limp wristed libbie. Leave an empty chamber for them to scream and lie on.  I know Apple brand loyalists who are ditching them because of the parler thing.  delete delete delete   Uninstall but buy the stock at discount then sell for massive gains lol  No. Fucking. Shit.  Maybe their stockholders will organize a peaceful protest.  They can coordinate the event on Facebook.   a href  https   ibb.co HgH0KQq  rel  nofollow   GoodBye  a    quot You love to see it. quot   Not surprising at all  just think back to 2016. Twitter was a dying platform and all of the kiddos were like  quot wHo eVeN UsEs TwITtEr quot  when Trump really started platforming on it.  Is going to go down more today likely

But I do picture his tongue to come out like a Komodo Dragon.  He is clearly on land more than in water... Pretty concrete evidence for a tortoise.  Slow and lumbering.  Satanic. Just like Graham  Pelosi  Schumer. Fucking creepy mother fuckers.  He s a swamp creature.  I think him and Graham belong to the sodomite species.  Any rally that isn t for the left will be considered this way.  We have lost folks  in more ways than the election.  They re coming for us.  We re already at the point where standing for the national anthem is considered a racist act.  Soon even flying a flag in your front yard will be offensive to some people.  Are there any Americans that actually want this shit   You ve gotta realize what the people pulling the strings want is absolutely independent from what the general population wants. Sure  there s some overlap  but there s a reason that when the people demand a basic thing like COVID relief  that it gets turned into a massive bill with a bunch of unrelated bullshit buried in it. That unrelated bullshit is what they want. The part you voted for  That s a Trojan horse. Every time. Both parties. At this point  I m convinced that Pelosi raises her wine glass  McConnell rails a line of coke  and they congratulate each other on how easily they re able to manipulate the American people into getting them rich at the taxpayer s expense.  This is something I don t get...they re 80 years old  very wealthy  and hold a lot of power. Why does more money even matter to them at this point in their lives   Evil  The love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. Not surprising.  Bravo. One word says it all. They won  39 t win though. Some of us believe in a higher power who will smite the evil doers.  Well  eventually. Theres no guarantees about our country tho  I don  39 t believe God delivers justice on earth. A hundred billion souls have died while praying to survive  why should ours be any different  Our reward is life after death  nothing else.  Most chinese didnt want to be part of a communist dictatorship either  I actually had this conversation yesterday. I don t know any democrat friends or family that want any of what you mentioned.  We are the minority. There are 100 150 million of us at max  At this point it won t matter. Once a Democratic House hands off an amnesty bill to a Democratic Senate to be signed by a Democratic President it will add 30 million Democratic voters to the rolls. The Republicans will never hold power ever again. The influx of Latino voters will more than likely vote for what they know. The socialist will have this country. This is set in motion  the fat lady is singing. By the time Biden is forced out and President Harris is sworn in the Democrats will be rolling joints with the Declaration of Independence and using the Constitution to light the bonfire we are all burned on.  And for the last 40 years  we have been importing new  quot Americans quot  from places with no history  experience  or culture of freedom or representational govt. then telling them in school that the US is the worst  most racist country ever.  Our future appears more and more like Ilhan Omar  and she has no issue with putting boot to neck.  Yes  dude  there are. I don  39 t know them and you don  39 t know them  but they  39 re the people that get amplified because they beg for more authoritarianism.

I think people who are optimistic live in places unlike mine.  The one think is already here.  As a Canadian  this defeatist attitude is troubling to me. Americans have been known to take on much harder tasks than the current one before them. Where is the spirit that defeated the British against overwhelming odds  Where is the strength that defeated the democrat slavers during the civil war  How about that National Socialists  WW2 would have been lost without the Americans. There are things that can be done to fight this. For instance  truckers can refuse to deliver Amazon products until they stop playing politics.

And this freaking stupid education system which has removed civics and ceases to teach people about our laws  nation  and founding have made a deluge of weak ass soyboys who are afraid to fight and hide behind masks all of the time.  Idk. Honestly a lot of this could be solved if corporations were not allowed to make political contributions in the first place. It is now news worthy that  quot X company stopped Y contributions to K candidate quot    so then people bandwagon on it and demand Z company do the same or they stop buying their products  giving much more leverage to the dollar for the opinions it can sway by chaining influence via economic pressure.   We will. Some of the people on Reddit are very young. They need to become engaged in local politics. This is where it starts. Please take heed. If you don  39 t agree with the stripping of your Constitutional rights  get off of Reddit today and call   your local Republican party. It starts here. President Trump is going to stay involved.  I ve been told  by friends of many years  that I need to be reprogrammed.  That I m not a bad person I just don t realize how my thoughts are troublesome.  I also am the wage earner for my family.  As those at the capitol protests outside and the riots inside will tell you  they have been doxxed and fired.  Having an alternate opinion is no longer allowed.  Only   Doesn  39 t matter  evil never wins. We  39 re not going anywhere.  It  39 s important to discern the thousands of peaceful protestors at the rally from the few rioters that acted independently from the protest.  Funny thing about MAGA rallies  they decried window smashers as  quot Antifa quot  and wrestled them away multiple times. A cop was assaulted by a couple of armed yahoos  why are so many in Bicycle Helmets  btw   at the front trying to breach the doors and protestors came up from behind and dragged the assaulters off the cop to the cheers of the protesting crowd.  Peaceful assemblies as domestic terrorism   Well yeah  you have to destroy innocent people  39 s businesses  homes  and lives that have absolutely nothing to do with what you  39 re protesting to be peaceful.  The hypocrisy is laughable.  It s amazing how far Dems overstepped  their 50 50 Senate mandate.  The left now cares about cops and property though. Rules for thee...  Those fucks took MLKs words and bastardized them into thinking violence is the way to attain social change.  Even Malcom X was against this shit by the end of his life.  Yes  How can it be peace if you are not supporting the approved opinions and repeating the required slogans   You will be deplatformed as a human shortly  Become an unperson is the language in the newspeak dictionary volume 4 that you should be using comrade. If other people hear you use out dated language not approved by the party it will be very doubleplusungood for you.  Delete. Any. And. All. Social. Media. Now. If. You. Haven  39 t. Already.    A couple months ago  they were 110  against labeling anyone a terrorist. BLM Inc and antifa could take over cities blocks and burn down buildings and they were  just an ideology .  Just trade the red hats for blm gear.  All opposition is terrorism. Wear a mask and collect your  2000 government check without objection. Work and business are now forbidden because of the Invisible Enemy   Is that sarcasm I  39 m detecting  Don  39 t think I wont report this to the Wrong Think Internet Police  sup TM  sup   they are rallying so hard against Trump it convinces me more and more he was the right guy for the job.  I  39 d like to see what the result would be if they did a National referendum on Congressional term limits.  gatherings of our political opponents will now be classified as Domestic Terrorist Activities... How dare anyone think to oppose our RULE    Democrat double standards at work  they can  39 t stand to hear out the other side and have a difference in opinions. They also never condemned the burning and rioting of cities months ago...  They are afraid.  Just bring something big to burn to every rally and you ve got yourself a peaceful blm protest instead  Democrats have done more damage to civil rights in a week than Trump did in 4 years...yet somehow he is literally Hitler.  What I like to ask ppl ranting about Trump so much is   And most Americans will be too blind to see  No  more like too stupid to know what s going on. Why do you think the US educational system is so fucked  It s easier to take everything from people that are too dumb to see it going.  Homeschooling is the way now. Don  39 t let your children be subjected to radical thinking.  My grandchildren will not go to traditional brick and mortar school. Most people on the Right have made this decision already.  So antifa isn t considered domestic terrorism   i have read many books and short stories like this. It usually does not end well     removed   Then step the fuck up and lead from the front  be the change you want to see in the world.  Thank you  That s what I ve been arguing for. Firm but peaceful.  I completely agree with you. You can  39 t lead from the back.  If true  this is peak hypocrisy.  We  39 re beyond hypocrisy  this is just straight up tyranny.  MAGA is an idea  They are afraid of something... and its not a few windows breaking and security guards shooting a woman in the neck.  Ok  so what are the feckless republicans in congress going to do about it   So  when will  em any  em  right leaning rally be classified as domestic terrorism  Trump will be gone in a few days.  Will any candidate with  R  after their name be vilified   Yes.  The war has already started and not with bullets and guns but with bans and censorship. We need to to figure out how we fight back.  I  39 ve been saying it for awhile  This is a new cold war.  The Cold War never ended. This  em IS  em  the Cold War.  If they let this happen  that means  quot John Smith quot  who runs as a Republican for President long after Donald Trump is gone will also face his campaigns being labeled as domestic terrorist activity. That  39 s the precedent they  39 re setting  that any opposition to the Democrat party is bad.  Damn  they  39 re against freedom of speech  we  39 ve known that for years now.  DoJ has   25 cases of domestic terrorism already open   a href  https   www.foxnews.com us 25 domestic terrorism cases capitol riot  https   www.foxnews.com us 25 domestic terrorism cases capitol riot  a    Why are they fascists   And this is why every gun law is an infringement...  Going to wait to see the evidence for this one.  so will they classify BLM rallies as domestic terrorist activity since those were objectively worse in terms of violence destruction deaths  oh right  those domestic terrorists support democrats.  It just keeps looking more and more like the reichstag fire  This won t get past committee. It s blatantly unconstitutional  as if the constitution matters to them   Is that photo on the left real  Gross  I m moving to Mexico.  After the fact  lol  Pelosi doesn t look a day older than 107.  Letting their true colors shine  Commie Red  Democrats do not believe in the Constitution and thus will work to erode Freedom of Speech  ie the First Amendment . It  39 s part of why they want to step on the Second Amendment  to make it easier to erase the rest.  How bout the fucktards that are still out there burning down Portland  Is that domestic terrorism   No. The fires being set in Portland are just an idea and a mostly peaceful one at that.  This is a first amendment violation  This isn  39 t a Republic in trouble. This is a Republic in its death throes.  So everybody that opposes this needs to start showing up to and holding MAGA rallies.  We  39 re Americans  it  39 s time we start acting like it.

They understand. They are lying to get power.  Totalitarian government in the making.  If Democrats didn t have double standards  they d have no standards at all.  The world began in 2016  how is this possible   I thought it ended in 2012   I  39 m starting to wish it did.  I thought we all died of covid.  But it s different when they do it   Hip Hop Chrissy  Literally every time they lost  The left have been coddled their whole lives  either by the government with welfare and other social programs  or by society with participation trophies and banning F grades from school. They are spoiled little children in adult bodies. They cry  quot me me me quot  and throw tantrums when they do not get their way  then their behavior is reinforced by professors and politicians who tell them they are precious and special and it  39 s really the straight white man  39 s fault things are bad.  This is the absolute truth from these entitled privileged Marxist s.  Objections to certification should be seen as the right of every federal legislator. This may lead to silly objections  but that is better than the alternative.  But now it is the impeachable offense of inciting insurrection.  You know why the left is like this today  its because there is no Robert Byrd to keep them in line  and all of you love circle jerking Hannity  39 s idiotic and irrational hatred of the man  Strom Thurmond and Robert Byrd were protecting this country from the Leftist Communists like AOC  Pelosi and co  this is why it took them so long  so while the rest of you keep hating on the man who tried to ban the murder of children via abortions  the Left will continue to march on in their war on our freedom.
t3_kvak0l,Ron Paul Banned from Facebook,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvak0l/ron_paul_banned_from_facebook/,Ron Paul is one of the last people I figured would ever get a ban from anything  honestly.  The GOP establishment hated him  they woud have banned him from being on the ballot during the primaries if they could. Despite no longer identifying as a libertarian or even a Ron Paul conservative I will never speak ill of him  he  39 s the epitome of principles and standing up for what you believe in. Screw anyone that trashes him or supports bans like this. He  39 s a better man than I could ever be.  Completely agree. Well stated. Make sure you edit the  ill of him  part   I would rather you not speak  I ll of him   He is adamantly pro freedom. That is dangerous to Democrats.  Yeah. Everyone knows Ron Paul is a violent terrorist.  sup  s  sup   Honestly  if they banned all conservatives at once that would be better than the slow drip we have been seeing.    They would lose a ton of money. So their convictions are only limited by their wallet.  He didn  39 t even do anything. Lol. So glad I got off facebook years ago  Me too...so toxic.  Twitter wasn  39 t too long after that and now that I see what Google Amazon and Apple are doing I  39 m going to look for an alternative to them too.  I rarely used twitter except to publicly communicate with large companies you would otherwise have no voice against.  But I deactivated my account last week and removed the app.  Switched yesterday.  It works great and seems a lot faster than Firefox.  I was looking at Gab yesterday. They have their own phone OS as well.  Thanks  I  39 ll check it out.  I was banned just before Christmas for seven days while the leftist I was arguing with got nothing. I said I was done and scheduled my over a decade old account for deletion within the next month and I haven  39 t looked back since.  Silencing the voice of people you don t agree with.....hmmmmm the actions of communists  Fascist...  It  39 s both really. So who  39 s getting killed with an ice pick in Cuba   lol they banned Ron Paul     em sad Ludwig von Mises noises  em   I m so happy there are two of us ...  Make it three  USA becoming China 2.0  Damnit if there s gonna be a most repressive regime in the world  it s gonna be us because we re the god damn UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. We do it right.  Texit time. It s the only way.  It s just Alex Jones  it s just Trump  it s just Paul.  Yup  a conspiracy theorist is worth 1000 Democrat politicians.  Lol if they ban Ron paul of all people  then no politician or public figure is safe.  And your everyday use sure as shit isn  39 t safe to begin with  The masks are coming off  now that the whole government is controlled by their party.  Yep they don  39 t need to appease their moderates any more  at least until 2022.  They used their mask as our muzzle  As soon as it has become clear that Trump will not be President after January 20th  big tech has gone full Nazi on banning all speech that they disagree with.  This is so upsetting.  I ve never been a big fan of his  but this is ridiculous. He is like the least ban worthy person.  Every time I see Ron Paul these days I  39 m surprised at how healthy and spry he seems. The dude seemed old way back in 2012 and he seems old now too but somehow more exuberant.  Probably much healthier after he left the swamp.  1984  I saw somewhere today that the hashtag  1984 was banned on either Twitter or Facebook  don t remember which. Oh the irony  They are one in the same. What one does the other will follow.  They go after Paul   they go after me. Fuck. This.  Just so you know  they aren  39 t going to stop.  They  39 ll simply abandon the pretext.  Now that  39 s just cruel.  Ron Paul  39 s been fighting for our rights since as long as I can remember. I hope we really get to see ornery unchained Ron Paul now  Ornery Ron Paul could be interesting. Angry Ron Paul seems terrifying some how.  Rand about to have some flashbacks to the first time he was busted smoking pot  Remember when Facebook made all the teenagers colour their profile photo in support of  quot gay marriage quot    and now we have  quot gay marriage quot    Nobody under 30 uses Facebook. They use instaSnatch and Twatter. Everyone under 30 makes fun of Facebook users  typically referring to anyone on Facebook as a Boomer. At least this is what I ve been told by all of my employees. And you d be surprised at how many late teens early twenties think the progressives are really weird. There s a reckoning coming for the left. They re just too blind to see it.  The generational numbers are actually really interesting. Apparently Gen Z is starting to look like the political antithesis of millennials in that they don t buy the SJ stuff and find a lot of socialist stuff questionable.

I  39 m afraid that it might be too late for the US  but we must keep up the good fight.  I mean...damn if that s not the most accurate thing I ve ever seen. And that s from an interview roughly 35 years ago.  You tell people communists are conducting a take over through information manipulation  thought control  and widespread propaganda  they will mostly look at you like you are insane. Yet it  39 s completely real.         Those who need to hear this most will deny and dismiss  You know just because people think you are crazy doesn  39 t mean you are.  In a mad world only the mad are sane.  If you haven t seen this video  it is a must watch.  I m shocked this video isn t banned yet.  Yea he is bone chillingly accurate  Spot on  Funny enough  Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War made many folks interested.  Jesus F Christ. No words.....

It wouldn  39 t be easy  but perhaps hurdling over the dem swamp is the best course of action.  And black box voting machines. Some of the lefty senators have been against them for years.  I nearly voted in the Democratic primary so I could vote for Warren because of this exact issue.  There is a miscalculation here. The left always believes they will seize power and keep it  that the tactics they used will never be turned on them. Case in point  the  quot nuclear option quot  for confirming judges.  This allowed Trump to appoint 194 federal appeals court judges   including 3 Supreme Court justices. This happened after only 1 presidential election cycle.  the left relies on freedom of speech and freedom of the press to continue harassing people like trump when they are not in power. But now they have broken the social contract on these issues  and I really hope we let them have it now    Our tolerance has  paradoxically  allowed for their intolerance.  All suppression of speech is abhorrent. It should never be considered a political option. The fact that it  39 s being used indicates some think it isn  39 t.   em  quot Every vendor from text message services to e mail providers to our lawyers all ditched us too on the same day. quot   em   They  39 re going to make damn sure Republicans never take power again. The scary thing is  they  39 ve got a good chance of pulling it off. I remember the response to complaints about Twitter is   quot Come up with your own platform  quot  Well  someone did and they destroyed it.  Good thing we have the FBI to investigate this obvious  a href  https   www.nolo.com legal encyclopedia content rico act.html  RICO  a  action.  I  39 ve heard RICO being applied here.

I expect this article will be blocked promptly amongst every large social media company at the same time.

He  39 s only pulling the plug now because it  39 s safe and it makes him look like he has a conscience.  Is anyone surprised  people legitimately thought alienating and silencing more than half the US population would work in their favor from a business perspective   That s the thing about the left they don t care about money it was all about changing how people think. They would make books  and movies not thinking about the profits  but the effect it would have on the culture.  oh they care about money.  they just truly believe they can force people to bow to them   even after disenfranchising them.  This is true to a point. They do care about money but like you said it is bigger than that. It is about culture wars and controlling information. Money can be made down the track.  It s a long play to avoid being broken up under antitrust law.  I deleted the app and won t be using them along with google or Apple. I know it s not much but I can t stand behind this garbage.  Gab.com is awesome  Tried to make an account yesterday but i guess the servers were too busy. I deleted my Instagram and FB is next as soon as I  39 m set up on gab. If it gets shut down thats that. Im almost 40 i really don  39 t need social media in my life anyway.  Had dame problem. Its super slow  scaling up serves as we speak  so will be faster  but if you just plan on it taking a while and let each page load you can get signed up. It  39 s a REALLY good UI. Gab is legit AF  as the kids say   Guess they didn  39 t think about the 88 or so million followers that follow Trump...  I would love to see millions of people delete their twitter accounts. That would be hilarious  I mean they re still valued higher than they were back in December. Let s wait at least until the market closes before we start making claims about stock prices. Fallout of this weekend s moves likely won t be realized for a quarter or two once engagement metrics are in and advertisers can weigh the impact on their ROI.  Yeah I was about to say... they re still 46  up from where they were 6 months ago  and as I m typing this they re only down 2.7  right now.  Yeah  I  39 m guessing this is more an indication of investor  39 s fearing the fallout than the fallout itself.  Gee  I wonder why banning the President of the United States from a major social media network platform would cause people to lose faith in said social media platform.  I wonder if tax dollars will be used to bail them out in the next stimulus package.  Hahah

Political win win  Gdam Nancy.   There is a fucking week just be patient lol  I said this on Facebook the other day and I found out that if they impeach him and convict him that it denies him his presidential pension  his healthcare  and it bars him from running again. That s the real reason they want impeachment. That s probably why republicans are coming on board. 75 million people feel that they were cheated  add in 4 disastrous years of Biden and Harris  the amount of support for Trump would be astronomical.  I doubt Trump could give a duck s fart for the pension or the health care. It s all about preventing another run.  But trump is so evil  He might hurt people  39 s fragile feelings if we don  39 t take him out and gas all of his followers   Take note of Republicans that vote for impeachment and make sure we remove them from office. I would say the same about Democrats but we all know nanacy will have them drugged and lined up with special interests monies to help them vote the approved way.  No doubt. Currently in  a href   r Alabama  r Alabama  a  people are wanting to oust mo brooks big time. These fucks want to destroy an old mans life over freedom.  All you ever needed to read to know Reddit doesn t represent the real world at all.  Alabama is one of the most strongly polarized states in the nation. Have you considered that maybe an anecdote about alabama is even less representative of the real world in america   Yeah  I  39 m interested to see what happens in the next 2 years. I expect a R primary backlash AND a moderate backlash. Like imagine if dumbass Rs spent months impeaching Obama after he left. Sooo fucking dumb.  The Democrats are unhinged  In other news  the sky is blue  They have completely lost their minds. The House is impeaching Trump a few days before they  39 d be out anyway  TDS truly is a disorder.   removed    removed   There s always that wait 9 fucking days option...  Nancy wants to impeach him so he can t run in 2024.  So why does she care. Trump has obviously damaged his image and reputation it shouldn  39 t matter if he runs again. And if he does  wouldn  39 t the democrats win easy after all trump  39 s done   Dems already know the clusterfuck that America would be once 4 years are up.  But but but   This is just going to set a precedent of impeaching presidents for the littlest things that aren t even true  No  don  39 t you see  he personally gunned down women and children tweeting something nonviolent. Somehow. Just trust us  We know what  39 s best for you   I heard he set the dead bodies of children inside pentagrams  set them on fire  peed on them to put them out  and then ate them.  Haven t they found a reason to try to impeach every republican president simce Reagan   Nah since Clinton actually. Payback for Clinton. Then it was W  didn t go anywhere. Herbert walker was never impeached or investigated.  You  39 d think it would  39 ve opened people  39 s eyes after the first failed attempt.

If they only sent black trump supporters  at least it would cause massive cognitive dissonance  Those don  39 t exist.  Biden said so.  Yea but they  39 re the good guys  em this time  em   Always remember  they think we  39 re Nazis. If you don  39 t understand that  you don  39 t understand them. If you don  39 t understand them  you can  39 t possibly hope to fight them. So many on the right need to get their heads out of their asses.  at this point with the Democrats sounding like faacist maybe I would go find some Bolshevik buddies to hang out in the streets with to protect me but then they also want to throw me into a gulag and strip me of everything I worked for.  Cleansing a fringe movement  and that  39 s all it is at this point  from American politics is not the same as cleansing a race of people from the planet.  Yeah but it s okay because they re good people and doing it for the right reasons. The arc of history bends towards progress even if it means you have to bend some conservative troglodytes against their will.
t3_kvj8xq,Facebook Blacklists All Content Mentioning Stop the Steal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvj8xq/facebook_blacklists_all_content_mentioning_stop/,Time to take Facebook to the trash can.  Done with them   Facebook is terrible for your health.   It really is.  I had to leave it because of depression.  I never use it.  Why would anyone exchange their privacy to keep in touch with friends  amp  families via social media.  You can use group messaging text on your phone.  It s already creepy that bots read everything you post  Cuckerberg listens to everything we say.  I typed that in just to get banned. I m trying to make them delete my account.  Solution.  Steal the stop   Fuck fuckerberg and Jeff bozo  Prevent the Purloin   I wonder why they have not done that since 2016...

It seems to be making everything worse. Unfortunately that  39 s not likely to happen.  Too late. This is just lip service.  Finally someone knocked some sense into the ACLU.  Nah  it  39 s the broken clock that  39 s right twice a day.  Where were you guys the past 4  years when conservatives all across America had been raising their hands trying to say something about this   Just a matter of time before the Dems start knocking the ACLU  Then do something about it  In before Democrats also put the  quot Theyre Trump supporters too   Seditionist  Treasonous  Dictators  Fascists quot  label to de ACLU you know  all the  quot buzzwords quot  that trigger people into offensive  its almost like a dog and a whistle.  Excuse me sir  you forgot nazi 
t3_kv9cpy,Dem congressman suggests Cruz Hawley be placed on nofly list,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv9cpy/dem_congressman_suggests_cruz_hawley_be_placed_on/,Yeah  no ulterior motives  just making it so my opposition can  39 t fly anywhere and is stifled from opposing anything my party  amp  I want to do. It  39 s totally in good faith. For America and the Constitution  guys   And if you oppose it  you are a domestic terrorist.  If conservative speech is not protected by the first amendment because it might incite violence  then calling America  quot systemically racist quot  should also be treated as incitement of violence.  This reminds me of the list the Nazis made of all Jewish people and banning them from using transportation  banks  services  etc  It  39 s absolutely amazing. If this were  strong all turned around  strong   and it was Hillary who was POTUS and had her election potentially stolen from her  I  39 d still be upset.  And if Republicans were suggesting the No Fly List be manipulated as  quot punishment quot   a tool  to be used against political foes   I  39 d also be upset.      It  39 s illegal to prevent a congressperson from performing their official duties.  How fascist of her to suggest that...  No no no  they can t be fascist  because they re anti fascist.  Lately I was thinking... The  quot fascists quot  are bad bad bad. Yet  somehow  they have no problems with guys running around with communists symbols ideology propaganda and so on.  This is absolutely insane.  The left has officially lost it  They re gunna try and do as much crazy shit as fast as possible while people are angry and not thinking clearly. It s political opportunism at it s most blatant  Its interesting scary that they are actually going against congressmen.   I just can  39 t believe the clapping seals go along with it.  Those people   primarily seen in  a href   r politics  r politics  a   are truly nothing more than useful idiots.   a href   r politics  r politics  a  is a self delusional hellscape where critical thinking goes to die  You  39 re like 10 years too late on that one the writing was on the wall..  Questioning the election is a terrorist act now. Got it. Don  39 t you dare question those in authority. Imagine Trump started placing verified twitter people on a no fly list because they incited violence. There  39 s thousands.  Anyone else think the dems are crazy enough to steal an election and then instantly go 1984 cos they are scared it will not last till inauguration day.  There is the right  and there is the the reich.  House Homeland Security Committee Chair Bennie G. Thompson  for those who don t want to click in.  Communist at there best . The Democratic Congressman  should be ousted.  They already put peaceful Trump protestors on the list  If it s  actions surrounding last weeks riot  they are targeting then put the entirety of the Dem congress and MSM on the list for inciting hate and violence  Democrats have lost their fucking minds  They are dangerous  Yeah  please help us expose the no fly list as a punitive tool for the political opponents. Not so long ago they had a bright idea to use this list as a source for 2A rights revocation.  Don  39 t they have their own private jets   Just don  39 t led Ted within 50 yards of a park or write to newspapers. Problem solved.

Fun fact about this sick bitch  Rosenberg serves as Vice Chair of the Board of Directors of Thousand Currents  a non profit foundation that sponsors the fundraising and does administrative work for the Black Lives Matter Global Network  Puerto Rican separatists shot several legislators in the Capitol while in session in the 50s  Jimmy Carter commuted their sentences.  It s such a shocking feat  this is completely scrubbed by the media TODAY. This isn t that long ago  That Rosenberg is a terrorist in bed with BLM  LOCK THEM UP   So the Left is just fine if you actually BOMB the Capitol building....just as long as you are doing so to kill Republican senators.
t3_kv4cqo,Pelosi Snaps At 60 Minutes When Pressed About Holding Up Covid Relief Criticisms From AOC,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv4cqo/pelosi_snaps_at_60_minutes_when_pressed_about/,I cannot for the life of me understand how a single person whether Democrat  independent  progressive or any layperson could ever like or even tolerate Nancy pelosi. She has to be one of the worst person in politics in recent history.  Really actually Gavin is her nephew or metaphorically bc they re all so entangled from their sf politic connection.  I  39 m almost curious enough to go look at her campaigns. I wouldn  39 t be surprised if she just tosses a sign out every few years that says   quot Don  39 t Forget  Vote Me quot  and calls it good.  I live in the bay area... she literally doesn  39 t even campaign.  Lol why would she even bother  She owns the DNC coffers and would never allow anyone to primary her. And there  39 s only like 3 people in her district that don  39 t blindly vote blue no matter who so it  39 s not like she  39 s ever going to get flipped in the GE.  Does anyone campaign against her   DNC would never allow that  As a head of the dnc  I guarantee she fucks around with anyone who dares run against her. I  39 m sure SF would love a far more progressive candidate anyway.  To be fair  it seems like majority don t like her  but I am with you  I don t understand why  em anyone  em  likes her  This doesn t add to the conversation  but when I first saw your flair I thought  damn how did this guy become a veteran conservative   The power of the media in your pocket. Most people are idiot sheep that think what the flashing lights tell them to think.  Eh... Harry Reid wins that race in my opinion.  She is not used to being questioned by the media. This part of the blue moon event is most entertaining   So TL DR   I d only they worked that hard at...working  You think they have guns  They shit themselves watching a Schwarzenegger movie.  Lmao  everytime she gets angry she just repeats herself until eventually blowing up and calling the journalist a right wing shill lol. Kinda sounds exactly like anytime a liberal questions their own. As if even asking the question is an indication they  39 re attacking the party. It  39 s like a religion  don  39 t ask the wrong questions. Actually more like a cult  even a religion would be happy to answer hard questions  not that Nasty was even getting any hard questions in the first place.  I have to say  it  39 s so weird when somebody steps out of line and questions their overlords. It  39 s so rare  so enjoy it while it lasts because we  39 re not getting much more of this soon. The censoring of conservatives this week is the warning shot to all media   quot stay in line for us as you have these past four years or else we  39 re going to do to you what we did to the conservatives. Just because we  39 re in charge now doesn  39 t mean you can start calling us on our shit. quot   It s like when she called Wolf a republican apologist for talking lmao  I know  right  Thats how quick she roasted him on tv  imagine her highness  the dark queen  in a closed door meeting....... quot off with his head     quot   Oh my God  look  60 Minutes is now a real news agency  Says nobody with any intelligence whatsoever.  Lol I know right  little late for that.  Don  39 t worry  they are going after freedom of the press next....for our  quot safety  quot  of course.  She is part of the reason California is fucked up.  Because her nephew Newsom listens to her every request  Anyone notice how often Pelosi snaps now  Between her and Joe we have 160 years of failed embarrassments in US politics. It  39 s fascinating that lefties continue to drink from the cartons of milk that are sour.  Yah but I  39 ll never respect Stahl as a journalist.  They  39 re all scum.  Softball interviews are an insult to American voters. Moderators at Democratic debates are an embarrassment. How telling is it that they do not ask  quot their quot  candidate a fair or tough question because they already know he or she doesn  39 t have a backbone  they just go with what the left wants to get them elected. Whores  all. I will never forget Hillary walking out to the stage on CNN and being greeted with a hug and kiss by Jake Tapper. Yes  this is completely normal in presidential debates. Vile.  Always instructive to see what happens when a democrat receives pushback from the media. First  there  39 s shock   they  39 re clearly caught off guard as this is not the norm from the MSM and as a result their answers are never crisp or even satisfactory because they  39 re forced to deviate from their script.  I find the second part a bit more interesting. I don  39 t know if Pelosi is in denial of her.... Years of wisdom.... But when ever so gently pressed by the press... She becomes quite snarky. She gets all tight lipped and just barely holds back her seething.  Isn  39 t it time Lesley lays her journalist career to rest    See  The SECOND any democrat gets any HINT of a hardball question they completely melt down. They can t handle being treated like trump was these past 4 years  Of course she does  the cunt  doesn t feel that she can even be questioned in her authority.  She  39 s not used to being asked tough questions.  I want to see the full  raw  undoctored interview. There has got to be a handful of gaffes that they are keeping out of the public eye.  This woman exudes big  how dare you  energy  Twin nutjobs.
t3_kvio29,Tick tock libs Gab unveils its project called the Liberal Hate Machine compiling threats slurs and more,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvio29/tick_tock_libs_gab_unveils_its_project_called_the/,The left s biggest weakness is that they have no true understanding of human nature. Trump won in part in 2016 because of the left s attacks on the character of conservatives falsely calling them racist  saying that they were only interested in guns and God. Now the left is trying to stand on the necks of conservatives and choke their voices. Don t they understand that these actions will consolidate the conservatives not bury them   Maybe it will... but I  39 m not so sure  The sad thing is   no one will care.  The left is never held to their own values and standards.  This is still a lesson not learned by some conservatives yet. Somehow we think we can still beat them with our rules.  Gosh  I love that  but I also think that absolutely nothing will come of it. Violence and incitement and hatred is totally fine as long as the leftist doing it. They feel perfectly justified  because they have completely dehumanized and demonized us to the point where even murder is justifiable  see this summer  When it comes full circle and they actually are victims  likely of their own doing  it will be extremely hard to not laugh at them because of this.  The funniest part of it is the liberals complaining about it and calling it Nazi...while they did it first.  Thats been their entire playbook for years now. First accuse whoever of exactly what you  39 re doing to distract from themselves.  Lists are Nazi when the right does them but when the left does them it  39 s accountability. See how they frame it so the opposing side always appears to be doing something to deserve it  The people on the left are fucked in the head.  They totally should make a constant feed of all their hate towards anyone that doesn  39 t agree with them. Is that what this is   Did they ban Gab from Twitter now  I noticed those tweets are gone  Lmao  gab is so based.   Now that  39 s the language I want to hear coming from Gen Z  soy free.

It can be a positive or it can be an addiction. Sadly  people do almost anything to feed their addictions. Even if that means selling your soul to the MSM and the socialists.  I  39 m... not sure about this one.  On the one hand  I  39 m glad we  39 re taking a stand.  But on the other hand  ISPs blocking websites seems like the type of precedent that will dramatically backfire on conservatives.  It s not a true block  if you want to access the sites they ll allow it if you request it  the default option is now  blocked  though.  I don  39 t think the answer to censorship is more censorship.  It  39 s not the answer but Congress isn  39 t going to do anything about it.  Uhh....hmm.  So proud of my red state      So  respond to fascism and loss of freedom with...fascism. Ok...

She just goes off color of skin.  AOC   quot Yes quot   Today on  quot everyone who disagrees with me is a Nazi quot ...  She is a complete idiot labeling conservatives as nazis. What a dipshit   Plenty of non nazis were banned   Mostly were just normal conservatives. This divisive bitch and her cult of a following are so brainwashed. Oh and what happened with Mrs  protests are supposed to be uncomfortable   They just wanted bread  AOC   Good way to use that Nazi tactic of labeling anyone who disagrees with you something so sub human and vile.  Next thing is that she  39 ll be calling for  quot unity quot  or maybe this is their unity. Unity through oppression and silencing those who disagree  Whatever is the end result of all this  they will define it as  quot unity quot  by simply making anyone who disagrees functionally invisible.  Exactly  This is coming from the person who didn t even understand Border Security and Laws surrounding it.  If your policies alienate millions of Americans  maybe don  39 t advertise that   Isn t using  neo nazi  incredibly ironic in her case as she has supported numerous public figures who call for the complete obliteration of Israel  Never really understood that.  While also trying to ban guns  force th government further into education  have reeducation camps for people who politically oppose them and removing the voice of any political opponent. All while spouting on about socialist ideals. I dont think they are self aware.  OR... Conservatives are leaving the platform in droves. She has a knack for coming up with incorrect conclusions a lot.  Go get my beer  and shut up. Crazy wait staff trying to have a conversation.... gawh  Maybe she shouldn  39 t advertise that fascism is a good thing.  How is it that everyone that s against her and the Democrats are being called bro nazis . Could it be because they just might be  the real enemy of the American people enemy of free speech freedom to choose what is good you instead of the government choosing for you . I think we all need to take a closer look at the people that are saying who the enemy is .  It  39 s an old Communist Soviet tactic. Anyone who disagrees with you or engages in wrongthink is a fascist or a Nazi.   We  39 ve reached the stage where if you disagree with a democrat you  39 re automatically a Nazi. The actual discussion topic is irrelevant   this is just a lazy yet surprisingly effective way to smear a person and justify whatever course of action they deem appropriate.  It s effective because libs don t know what a Nazi is or history for that matter.  They just want sound bites with enough  information  to feed their hate.  If they knew history they would realize what obedient little Nazi s they themselves are.  I envy the man who got her shoes.

As with everything else  facts are irrelevant to what Democrats believe.   He was the only thing standing between us and them. And now they are after us.  They hate him because they hate us.  Yeah  before the election I used to regularly comment on this subreddit without getting death threats and stuff. But now everyday I have at least one DM calling me a nazi and i should be wiped off the face of the earth.  Troll them with an easy going brush off or ignore them. They get weirdly angry and adamant when you laugh at their death wishes. Idk why. They think we care they hate us. I pity them  but that s it.  Truth spoken.  This is satire   Was going to say lol  I  39 m curious  did any politicians on the Left meaningfully condemn the months of riots  assaults  harassment  and deaths  Because I  39 ve seen large numbers of non Lefts condemn what happened in DC recently  but my memory is that most Liberals either celebrated BLM Antifa rioting  or pretended like it didn  39 t happen.  It would be one thing if those  mostly peaceful  protests were years ago. But it was only 6 months ago I vividly remember seeing a Mercedes dealership in Oakland get vandalized and at least one car burned up  all to a resounding  meh . Or worse   that s what insurance is for . But NOW they re outraged.  Dear God  any time I see it brought up they  39 re instantly like  quot THAT  39 S DIFFERENT. quot  Then they cite the conscious  deliberate  and complete ongoing genocide of all black people by the 100  corrupt and white supremacist police as being way more worthy of a riot than our claims  which aren  39 t grounded in fact.  This isn t even a joke.  He literally told people to peacefully and patriotically protest.   There  39 s a reason the immediately banned him right after he conceded that Biden won the election.

t3_kv8l56,Parler Sues Amazon After Tech Giant Kicks Site Off Its Servers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv8l56/parler_sues_amazon_after_tech_giant_kicks_site/,I m not a legal expert by any means but I feel like Amazon has enough money and lawyers to weasel their way out of any real consequences. It s unfortunate but hopefully  Parler finds a new home soon.  Amazon has Joe Biden and Democrats RINOs  Agreed.  Amazon provides services to literally every branch of government.  If anyone thinks for a hot second that Uncle Sam and Uncle Bezos are gonna go against each other  I got a bridge to sell you.  Haven  39 t seen any discussion yet about fact that over the  past couple years a large amount of gov  39 t IT  fed  state and local  infrastructure has been migrated to the cloud.  How long until a provider suspends service to a police dept that is  quot racist quot   a city that doesn  39 t defund the police  a fed agency that doesn  39 t fall in line with the green agenda   Since parler is gone whats next  Bitchute   Gab  Elon Musk says Signal.  Signal is a WhatsApp Messenger SMS etc replacement  not a Twitter Parler one.  I remember arguing with people years ago about repealing Net Neutrality. Their biggest fear was that internet providers and services would be free to silence opinions they didn  39 t like. In fact  it seems Amazon was against repealing NN for this very reason.  Net neutrality has nothing to do with Amazon kicking Parler off their servers entirely.  Amazon  39 s argument was that without NN  startups would be squashed and opposing views silenced... which is exactly what they are now doing to Parler. That  39 s the connection I  39 m looking at.  In reality  Amazon knew they would have to pay more for the massive amount of bandwidth they use for streaming instead of being subsidized by those smaller companies.  Oh  for sure. As they now show openly  their real concerns were never the little guys  There would likely have been unintended consequences either way. America runs on unintended consequences.  NN was about handing control of speech to the government  nothing more. It was regulation on who was allowed to set up an ISP  entrenching the large players  Comcast ATT etc .  Amazon  39 s argument supporting NN was based in protecting small startups and free speech  two principles they now violate.  Yeap  they so often engage in saying the opposite of what they are doing.  quot Upholding democracy  count every vote quot    gt  silence and remove dissent  Well  Google  39 s motto used to be   quot don  39 t be evil. quot    Don t like our rules  Then start your own damn business     removed   I  39 m appealing to Poe  39 s Law here.

That read  39 s like a  quot Don  39 t come to school tomorrow quot  note.  I looked him up. Lots of followers and lots of posts. I haven  39 t heard of him before someone sent it to me.  The only thing I saw was a giant warning on .win saying  em don  39 t  em  go to any armed state protests  as they  39 re likely all false flag ops.  Nothing what sp ever  Yeah I saw something on YouTube about it  a href  https   m.youtube.com watch v dQw4w9WgXcQ  here link  a   Not sure why. It  39 s pointless. Any amount of violence  even somebody blowing their nose in the wrong direction will be used against us for the next 4 years.  Damn  I hate being allergic to injustice.  Trump said go home in peace. Everyone should do exactly that. Trust in Trump. Stay home.  Seems far too convienent for this tip to be leaked to the media in the midst of a full propaganda campaign to censure all conservative voices.  My thoughts exactly. Back to the  white nationalist  rhetoric. The FBI. What a joke.  If people want to protest I support it  but it doesn t seem to make any difference. There were 2 big DC protests before the 6th and they were completely ignored. The masses have been brainwashed so effectively they think our opinion can be ignored and erased. I m not sure what the next step is  but if we don t get voter reform we are fucked.  Remember...hitler orchestrated an attack on his own soldiers as an excuse to invade Poland.  Reichstag fire got the Nazis a lot of excuses to clamp on opposition.  I was going to add this as well  They are trying to bait people into a conflict and looking for some great optics to spread propaganda.   Damned if you do  damned if you don t   Where do you think Bush Jr. got the idea for 9 11   My question is do they think doing any of the censorship  blacklisting  canceling  ect is going to make anything better for the 20th or is their goal just to piss people off so much that come the 20th something happens and it goes downhill from there.  Their goal is to piss people off  make them extreme  and record the optics to help their propaganda campaign. Then remove all resistance completely. Now that trump is out they hope to get back to getting filthy rich at the expense of the working class.   I feel like the language is purposely ominous.  I  for one  am in Oklahoma.  Constitutional carry.  Of course we  39 re armed.  If we  39 re at a protest  its an armed protest.  If we  39 re at the store  its an armed shopping spree.  If we  39 re at church  its an armed service.  If we  39 re at a restaurant  its an armed meal.  I thought we weren t concerned about protesters  and that protests were generally fiery but mostly peaceful   I  39 m sorry but I don  39 t think this is legitimate.  Conservatives are known for having jobs and the inauguration is on a Wednesday.  I would also add that the FBI doesn  39 t have much credibility right now.  My work just sent out a civil unrest bulletin. Last time we got that was when the Philippines had open season on drug addicts. I ve not  em heard  em  anything about an official protest and I m usually aware of them.  Hope this is not true. We need to calm down  and figure an effective way to fight the injustices that are occurring. We need to fight without violence.    x200B   Sounds like an excuse to send federal agents to whatever town they deem  could  have protests.  We had dudes stand in front of our court house the other day waving trump flags.  I would think it would take them at least 3 years to come to this conclusion.  Not when they  39 re the ones responsible for it.  If you go on Gab you  39 ll see how almost every comment is  quot dont go for the armed protests  its leftist groups hijacking the movement quot

Whoever wrote and published the book is pretty brave. I hope they did so with as much anonymity as possible.

I would tell them to look in the mirror  but I have seen antifa mug shots and know that they probably don t own one  Ok  seriously  what is it with those guys  Are they all homeless meth heads  They all loo like it  every single one.  Funny thing is that they all look like homeless runaways yet they have vehicles to travel from city to city with professionally made signs and weapons. No doubt they are being funded.  And the girls are proving the blue haired feminist trope time and time again  Maybe they are like the Hitler youth and all have standardized haircuts  Maybe they have a look book they can choose from    I m sure Amazon won t stock it.  These people need a hobby.  LOLOLOLOL remember  these weirdos really think they are anti fascists.  Where can I get this book that isn  39 t from a book vendor that supports the suppression of ideas  Powell  39 s is out. Amazon is out. Barnes and Noble is out. No small mom and pop places anywhere remotely around me.  It  39 s probably one page front side only  written in comic sans. We all know their tactics anyway  The left keeps telling me Antifa doesn t exist. If they don t exist  why do they care if someone writes a book about them   because censoring anything negative about you is not fascist  I guess   Forgive me I just woke up. So Antifa is no longer an ideology.
t3_kv6uda,Trump shows no signs of resigning amid U.S. Capitol fallout,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv6uda/trump_shows_no_signs_of_resigning_amid_us_capitol/,For people that wanted a peaceful transition of power they sure seem to be in a rush to push him out.  People on  a href   r politics  r politics  a  are saying how we are defending him not getting impeached and stuff  but like  he literally had one more week it s not that hard to wait  The point of Impeachment at this stage would to bar him from running again in 2024.  I don t think running him again would be wise. Need someone younger and more articulate but with his same energy. Someone more presidential that doesn t piss away voters with needlessly brash tweets.  Ted Cruz  Please no. The guy has the charisma of a bean salad  They wanted Trump to get down on his knees and kiss Biden  39 s ass. That  39 s the only  quot peaceful transition quot  they wanted to see. Since they aren  39 t getting that  they  39 ve just redefined  quot peaceful transition quot  to mean ousting an elected President via an actual coup  amp  making sure he can  39 t disrupt their system of corruption ever again.  Only peaceful if you conform to their world views. They don t want peace  they want conformity.  Yeah no kidding  He literally only has 1 week and a few days left.....people need to chill the fuck out.  Meanwhile  we have a pandemic to deal with but our royalty would rather focus on giving trump one last middle finger.  Kinda tells you the true seriousness of the pandemic.  He said something  some extremists took it the wrong way and  got violent. Name president who this didn  39 t happen under. Obama indirectly caused someone to murder five cops in Dallas. Sanders indirectly caused someone to open fire at Republicans at a baseball game. I  39 m no Trump supporter  but I fail to see how is this is any different.  He explicitly told them to be peaceful... Right before they left  The difference is  you are dealing with power hungry nutcases. They  39 ve been starved out of power for 4 years and they can  39 t wait to get back and rip everyone to shreds for denying them power.   Good he shouldn  39 t.  Why would he resign   Why would he  Baseless resignation is for cowards.  Trump is a master troll  he will wait until the last second just to make the liberals cry.  It did occur to me that if it were looking like he might be removed from office  he would resign like 60 seconds before the final vote.  Which is why they are pushing a post facto impeachment idea.  Screw all these repubs calling Trump a quitter when he took every legal and strategic avenue against the election irregularities. Even if he did leave the public eye his political generational legacy is sealed not to mention also represented by 75  disenfranchised voters and international patriots. He really has started a new movement and he won t even live long enough to see the end of it.  He shouldn  39 t resign  and on the day he  39 s supposed to leave the White House he should pretend he  39 s walking in slow motion while he steals all of the toilet paper out of the bathrooms.  Why would he  This is the last way you get someone like Trump to resign...  Because fuck cancel culture that s why  He wont resign so they used their tears to draw up articles of impeachment.   Fuckin  39  A right.
t3_kvd7aj,Facebook Says It Is Removing All Content Mentioning Stop the Steal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvd7aj/facebook_says_it_is_removing_all_content/, Does not apply to Stacey Abrams  At this point if you re a conservative and you haven t deleted your Facebook you are a part of the problem. Download all your pics  easy button to do it in the settings  message anyone you actually care about with your number and other ways to stay in touch  and delete it. Encourage others to do the same.   I m torn here. I m not sure whether it s better to do a mass exodus from social media or for us to remain on until they force us off  and continue to spread our ideas in the public sector. I m sure with some of my friends  I am the only conservative voice but they ever hear  and I am very  very careful and moderate about what goes on my Facebook  because people from work follow me  Mass exodus. Facebook makes all of its money advertising to you. If 10s of millions leave they lose serious money and their stock will take a beating.   I see your point. No  I m definitely not apolitical  but I am also cautious about the way that I word things so I don t lose my job. Then again  not having a Facebook would definitely prevent that  That s how I made my decision today. If I m to the point where I m censoring what I post on my own account  then why do I have it  It s just going to make life a lot easier to not have to worry about it at all and spend my time doing more productive things.  As soon as you remove all the Russian collusion shit that  39 s still up  that was never taken down nor had corrections issued after President Trump was found not guilty of collusion.  1984  This is the prequel to 1984... we get to see how it all started.  1983  But  resist  is ok.  Only Democrat approved resistance is OK.   removed   A lot of people already have. Personally I haven t had Facebook in years as I found no value from it and I ve just recently deleted Twitter.  I  39 m only using it to follow groups I like  but I guess I have reddit for that.  Twitter was hard for me to leave only because I probably spend too much of my time following sports and it s easy to get trade rumors and such on there even though I disliked everything else about the platform. Now I just pay closer attention to ESPN and the sorts.  Made my final tweet and instagram posts an hour ago. Im done.   I think you need to actually request for the account to be closed in order to make a difference.  Right. I am more or less just  quot parking quot  my accounts. Don  39 t want anyone claiming my name. Deleted both apps from my devices.  Stop considering  do it.  Should I be reporting my neighbors with the signs to the FBI   Good thing I m a horrible speller  Stahp tha steel   60  of the time works every time  Delete you re account and watch their stocks pummel to the ground.  They  39 re gonna try and remove all evidence that this ever happened.  Gotta wonder when they ll come after this subreddit.

True. I wish most of these companies operate under the constitution as their headquarters are located here. Too bad most people look away as real censorship is actually happening.  Yes  because any country valuing it  39 s freedoms can see the handwriting of where this is going. Is the Left going to de platform the world in hopes that this is going to bring about a One World Order   no descent  no free thinking  Anybody really jazzed about living like the Chinese   Australia is owned by China. We sold everything off to them already. They are now hurting us big time with huge tariffs put on to wreck our industries. We have a left wing media that governments always try to appease and will sign up for the new world order in a flash selling out its people and its people will submit.  I ve been out of the loop of Australian news the past couple of months. What happened to ScoMo  I swear Australia changes prime ministers more than some people change their socks.  ScoMo  39 s still the PM  he  39 s just on leave for a week.  Then do something about it   Don t be fooled by the Australian government.

t3_kv34gx,Biden Priority For Economic Business Relief To Be Made Based In Part On Race Gender,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv34gx/biden_priority_for_economic_business_relief_to_be/,I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin  but by the content of their character.   Martin Luther King  Jr.  TIL MLK Jr is racist.  He  39 d easily be a conservative today.  Regardless of how he votes he  39 d be a sane voice and we need more of those.  They are drowned out by the mass of morons.  Being a moron with your speech is still protected under the first amendment.  Oh yeah totally  if you ignore the fact he hated capitalism.  Outside of the socialism  probably.  No shot  he was socialist.  I am not so sure. Joe Biden would be a conservative today if had the same values that he had 20 years ago as a democrat.....  Xiao Biden has no values that I can detect  other than the ones he gets in the earpiece.  Swamp creature for 47 years  lol funniest thing I  39 ve seen all day.   It  39 s a bit much  but the way they treated MLK in that vid is how they are treating Trump right now.  MLK has been rolling in his grave so hard the past 9 months you could hook his skeleton up to a dynamo and it  39 d generate clean electricity.  Or whether or not they wear a pussy hat.        Fighting Systemic Racism with Systemic Racism.  This is quite ... racist. Are we counting Asians as whites still or is that just for college admission   Asians are honorary whites apparently.  So are Cubans. And black and Hispanic conservatives. All female conservatives are white too ofc.         ...and Disneyland passes.  Aren t they the richest demographic in the country   I think technically it  39 s like first generation Nigerian immigrants who are.  Asians are too hardworking to be considered a minority  So white males do not apply.   Don t forget asians. They are not a  real  minority per dems.  No because when they are included as minorities  they skew the whole narrative of  quot whites outperform minorities due to racism. quot   Did you see the Asians lost their lawsuit against Harvard   Discrimination is ok in certain cases     They re only a minority when it s convenient to leftists.  Nope because Asians have surpassed  quot whites quot  on the socioeconomic ladder.  Asians overwhelmingly voted for Biden. This is what they voted for.  In America  sure. In the world   Absolutely not. Between China and India alone  that  39 s near 3B ppl  a third of the world  39 s population.  Hunter Biden exempt    How dare another white man try to live as comfortable and privileged as me.    Joe Biden probably   deleted    quot All animals are equal  but some animals are more equal than others quot   white males don  39 t need jobs when you got  quot 10  to the big guy quot  coming in every month...what  you guys don  39 t have that too     Already calling for divisive policy before he  39 s even seated. It  39 s gonna be a long LONG 4 years  folks.  It ll be even longer when Kamala takes over and has even greater radical changes.  4  Get fucking real. After they give blanket citizenship to 10 million   illegal immigrants the left will control the government for the next 2 decades.  Sue him for civil rights violations  Can  39 t. Our courts have proven they support fascism. Our laws mean nothing  Introduce policies based on race  what could possibly go wrong  This is what happens when the president elect has the critical thinking skills of a bag of hammers.  So much for the 14th amendment...  Sue  Awesome because I just started identifying as a black woman   We  39 ve had similar laws like this in South Africa for more than 20 years. It   Exactly as you said. Every white person I know  from the educated to the poorest  either want to leave or plan to do so. I  39 m one of them. You have your more patriotic ones as well of course who would stay no matter what. I don  39 t know what to make lf that.   I see white business in my area closing at the same rate as black   minority businesses.  They re all struggling.. but sure let s dangle relief money in peoples faces based off of race.  I read through this article. All lies. He say s it  but will not follow through. The very business he speaks of will be crushed by the end of his term  or Commala s term  if you will.  It  39 s Democrat Kungflu policies that are crushing small and minority businesses.  KungFlu... lol  .. I ve heard ChinaVirsus or ChinaFlu too.  Really triggers the libtards  How does that not violate anti discrimination laws   Well  Biden is a racist and a sexist.  We knew this already.  I just wonder if the entire Democrat party and Liberals as a whole are going to fall in line and out themselves as the same racists and sexists   Well  I  39 m already black. I am announcing now I identify as a stunning and brave woman.   Isn  39 t that racist  No  I forgot racism doesn  39 t apply towards white people...  Crazy that the ideology I grew up in is now the party of racism  bigotry  and discrimination. The fact that these people now openly defend it is insane.  Wow.   I have four daughters and they will all buy guns with that money. Get fucked.  Assuming it  39 s still possible to buy guns by then. Better buy what you can now.  I saw a yeet cannon for  600 on armslist lol.  White and Asian males can get fucked I guess.  Sad.  Yeah screw small businesses that are struggling  but the owner is white.  Problem   you have a wonderful multicultural country  thankfully getting more diverse every day  but one group  white males  found and run around three quarters of all businesses. Not fair.  Whiskey  tango  foxtrot   Segregation is back baby   Fucking idiot  Guess what handouts I ve gotten as a white male  None. Guess what I had to do to make up for it  Work my     off. I ve got no problem with that.  Classic leftist racism.  Nice  that  39 s racist  em and  em  sexist. Good job you old puppet POS.  I  39 m still waiting for my  2 000 stimulus check he promised that would go out the second Georgia put in those two Democrats.  Smh. Whatever. Idiot in charge  It s evolving just backwards  Don t worry guys  I ve been reliably informed that Biden s a moderate and firmly stands on principle. He won t shift positions at the drop of a hat   s  Well  that  39 s racist  I don t care anymore  the commies have rotted the foundation of our country  everyone is stupid and everything is dumb  burn it all down and let s start over. I don t care anymore.  Too bad the SCOTUS is compromised  since this is clearly a violation of both the 14th amendment and discrimination laws.  Well the most common last name in America is now Patel...so does this make white people minorities now   Uh... sue that motherfucker for discrimination.  Damn that sure sounds pretty racist and sexist.  Thats the definition of racism. Discrimination by the color of someone  39 s skin.  Tell me this is satire...  Divide the Americans more on race and gender and rule them   What on Earth does that look like  Joe    We need some folks to sue over this the moment it gets enacted. The key is finding a white male owned business who qualifies for whatever they have in mind and who is denied based on nothing other than race and sex and this one is a slam dunk under the 14th Amendment. People really need to be ruthless in the courts with this stuff. This is the first steps toward the stuff that s happening in South Africa these days.  The Biden admin is already promising racist policies  Imagine that.  Ahh yes the answer to race discrimination on the right is discrimination from the left. Ffs. Malcom x and MLK are spinning in their graves. A friend of mine summed it up best when he said  quot  the democrats know there is money and votes in exploited black emotions. quot   We  39 re all going through a Pandemic. Why is systemic racism now acceptable

It s not leftists calling for violence online like most people here seem to think.  God I hate Twitter.  Yeah  they absolutely should. They did eventually ban this one at least.  I don  39 t think most think that hashtag is coming from the left  pretty sure most know where it  39 s coming from.  People are just pointing out the hypocrisy of it all.  It  39 s against a Conservative  so they  39 re allowing it to trend.  That  39 s right...we are no longer just deplorables...we are now F  CKING deplorables.

If libtards go full bore and do everything they  39 ve promised to this point... They will lose the senate and house the next cycle. With Trump not on the ballot and Biden running amuck  America won  39 t stand for it. Same thing happened to Obama after he passed the ACA. Lost both house the next cycle.
t3_kvfnaf,Amazon partner GoDaddy boots gun site from its servers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvfnaf/amazon_partner_godaddy_boots_gun_site_from_its/,What does all this accomplish   Quite a bit actually. The reverberations of these moves by big tech are going to be felt for a long time. The banana republics that these big tech corporations have become at the behest of their far left employees will certainly lead to some interesting years ahead.  What will all this accomplish  Your reply says nothing. What a worthless comment. Say what you mean to say. Literally all you said is reverberations are going to be felt for years ahead. Like what  The vague edginess is just agitating.  This is the fascism that they accused the Trump administration of practicing.  Nothing. Arfcom  quot being down quot  greatly depended on what DNS each person was using. Site staff had a new domain up and running before it went completely dark. Then about 30 minutes later Godaddy restored the registration.  Big market available for regular  decent people if Amazon  Microsoft  and Google will host for only leftist morons.  Trick is getting startup money.  Amazon  39 s a behemoth now  but when they started they bled investor money for years before they got into the black.  hence the rumor Trump will be one of those people.  Koch Bros and their gang of donors along with Musk could have platform running by tomorrow.  Musk donates privately to a lot of smaller startups  he personally does not have time to dive too deep into these things.  It  39 s all happening so fast.  GoDaddy has been a slimy company since day one. Last year I had to buy a domain I wanted from them but transferred it to NameCheap as soon as I was allowed to. The year before I was waiting for another domain registered with them to expire and paid them to  a href  https   ca.godaddy.com domains domain backorder  watch it for me  a  so I  39 d have first dibs if the old owner  who hadn  39 t used it in several years  didn  39 t renew it. The domain had actually already expired and was just a few days from the end of its 30 day grace period when it would be put up for auction. Suspiciously 12 hours after I paid them to watch the domain the owner magically remembered about it and renewed it. Of course the fee I paid to GoDaddy wasn  39 t refundable. I  39 m certain they told the old owner someone was waiting to pick it up so they could keep my money as well as the renewal fee.  Godaddy is absolute trash and you are 100  correct. Idk if they still do this but if you type in a domain to buy and decide not to  they ll go ahead and buy it  and then charge your ass an Upcharge.  Question is  do we all dare say peace out to all the big tech companies  I m fine dropping all Amazon services and cancelling memberships. Facebook is lame  I ve already cancelled Twitter. I was already concerned about the loss of local businesses before these big tech shenanigans  so I m fine shopping local.
t3_kv8ozz,New push to kill Section 230 protections for Twitter Facebook big tech,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv8ozz/new_push_to_kill_section_230_protections_for/,Removing 230 would be absolutely horrible for any web based business  especially the small ones. That is not the solution.  I think that ideally section 230 would be more of a spectrum of protections granted based on how much moderation is applied. No moderation   max protection. More moderation   less protection  They still have to moderate legally for things like CP... that was actually the intent of 230 just to remove blatantly illegal material.  100 .  Section 230 repeal is exactly what Zuckerberg and Dorsey want.  Don t give it to them.  Isn  39 t the issue just some of the wording in 230  If I understand it correctly it  39 s something like  quot platforms can remove things that are illegal  etc  etc  or otherwise undesirable quot . Wouldn  39 t just amending the wording be the right way to go   Wish they would have done it before now... I don t like their chances when the democrats know big tech is helping push their agenda.  They have zero motivation to do it at this point.  Politics can make strange bedfellows.  There might be some support from the socialist wing of the Democrats because A  they enjoy fucking over large corporations and B  they should suspect that they will be next on the social media chopping block  because Big Tech will want to silence some of the far left Democrats who make the party look nuts.  Good point.  Maybe they would help force some of the big tech companies to break into multiple companies at least.  Remember  big tech wants regulation.  This should have happened years ago. Better late than never  if it actually passes  .  Idgaf about reform anymore. REMOVE IT  Yes  because this will get far in a Democrat House  a Democrat Senate  and a Democrat White House.  s  Oh  now they  39 re pushing for it.  After they let an election get stolen from them.  The Republicans showing everyone they  39 re as useless as ever.  That push is going to absorbed by the woke crowd in Washington before it gets anywhere.

Very healthy thing to do.  Just more proof this has nothing to do with trying to stop violence.   If you re not with us you re against us    censored Ron Paul for posting the same column he  39 s published since 1976 with no warnings whatsoever.  Guess libertarians are too far to the right for commiebook.  This is overreacting.  Americans are good at overreacting.  Libertarianism is great in theory but is just not feasible in a world with so many bad actors.   Looks like next election Libertarian is helping out Republican to win

Ok  you got me  that was funny as hell lmao  It  39 s honestly not as good as the title makes it out to be.  pessimism aside it  39 s a really good sign that not only are foreign countries watching  but speaking up and siding with Trump  even if they don  39 t agree with him and have been his adversary for the last 4 years. it means CCP doesn  39 t have control of the flow of information that they think they do.

Seriously mods can we make a rule about reposted of almost the same stories  It fractures conversations and makes it hard to find new worthwhile topics.  I tried to do something about it as a mod  they booted me as a mod lol  Dude relax  amp  take it.   The medal is really chocolate  People want politics out of the game. This is BB keeping politics out of the game.  By citing a political reason   You make a great point...  As a Bostonian and Pats fan  I ll say Belichick does everything humanly possible to eliminate distractions. As big of a Trump supporter as he is  and he s been one since the beginning   he s not trying to deal with the political drama that could come out of it. He s keeping politics out of football and we could use more of that.  Fellow Bostonian here. You  39 re right. There would be backlash from people  the left . Not sure why he cares  but he does.

t3_kvh6m6,President Donald J. Trump Approves District of Columbia Emergency Declaration,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvh6m6/president_donald_j_trump_approves_district_of/,Does anyone know why exactly this is happening   Very interesting indeed. Wonder if there s a 4D chess move behind this or not...if it was purely because of the riot then he could have declared this much earlier.  What 4d chess move could this possibly be  Not entirely sure. He s had a lot of options available to him the whole time but he knowingly chose to wait and go the way of the courts because that s the  right thing to do .  Insurrection act.  If he was going to he would have already.  He had to wait for the China EO to come into effect so all of Congress would be guilty of treason  Take note of the national guard being brought in to DC. Governors are sending in thousands of troops. It s being claimed that  violent protests  will be taking place at state capitols. There is a  very  likely chance that Antifa will be targeting these capitols  posing as Trump supporters. In fact  they re trying to convince us that Trump supporters are going to riot at the Twitter headquarters in San Fran. This is their supposed reason for the massive amount of NG troops.   It doesnt to me. It feels like Trump has given in bro. Im sorry but you  39 re on the conspiracy theorist side if you think antifa is dressing up as Trump supporters to false flag something. The capitol riot was Trump people. It was. There WERE antifa people there  but the majority was Trump supporting people. As for whats yet to take place we will see  but its incredibly unlikely there  39 s false flags occurring across the country on inaguration day.  If that s your view  I can t change it. I can only speak to my experience. Here s what I know   I saw videos of security letting people into the capitol. I saw videos of weapons being passed out to people. I saw videos of Trump supporters calmly walking between the ropes in the capitol  polite as could be. I saw videos of Trump supporters vocally calling out and identifying Antifa. I saw videos of Trump supporters trying to stop those who were breaking the windows.   I think theyd totally be willing to. I saw all the same footage you mentioned there too. I agree the media is scummy. But the capitol riot WAS trump supporters. And just like every riot  not everyone there was  em rioting  em   I genuinely don t understand what you just said. You just said you believe they d be willing to do all the things I talked about. Then the next sentence you say the riot WAS Trump supporters.   Yup. I think theyd be willing to.... Im not convinced this one WAS. Big difference. Not hard to understand. I havent seen any proof this was orchestrated by antifa.  We haven t seen any evidence proving that it was all Trump supporters  either. Nothing has been proved. And there is very reasonable motive and logic pointing to the fact that it  em could  em  have been Antifa.   I wonder if it has anything to do with the FBI report of armed protests in Washington and also in all state capitals. Things seem to be reaching a boiling point with Democrats stirring the pot  what s new   and Republicans not offering any leadership in how to defend their rights and our rights in a peaceful manner.  that explains the 10 000 troops. sorry to some of you that thought it was the insurrection act lol  It was for the inauguration... he was asked to declare it a state if emergency for the inauguration and he did.  Darn it...

t3_kuuzim,Bollywood Actress Kangana Ranaut slams Twitter CEO after ban on Trump Islamists nation and Chinese propaganda has bought you completely you only stand for your petty gains... U are nothing but a little slave of your own greeds. Dont preach again its embarrassing.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuuzim/bollywood_actress_kangana_ranaut_slams_twitter/,Have no idea who she is but she ain t wrong   She s a Bollywood actor. It seems that Bollywood gt Hollywood  yh its not owned by china  Twitter fr on their knees sucking Xi Jin Pings tiny asian dick for money  Indian here  Bollywood is an industry that is  very  apolitical  only a very few outspoken people like Kangana Ranaut are exceptions. Not to mention  she  39 s at odds with the rest of Bollywood for peddling drug allegations and shit against them. Apolitical reasons again.  A quick google search gives multiple accounts of here being taken to court for defamation over what she tweets  and that she bullies other actresses. These are all just in the last few days. Not exactly somebody to be referenced to prove a point here.  True  but she s an A list actress at her peak. Imagine Jennifer Lawrence or Margot Robbie supporting Trump.    Looking into it  I don  39 t think she cares about Trump one way or another. She cares that there is a chance to discredit twitter to help her own defamation case. If someone defamed her using twitter I  39 m sure she would say the opposite to give the platform credence. She is unaffected by US politics  but is vested in how twitter is viewed. Politics aside  she appears to be a spiteful person who can act.  let me assure you that the Bollywood actors of actual repute are better at grammar and punctuation  They probably don t diddle children in Bollywood  Uhhh.... yea... the hub of child exploitation and all that... but its a nice sentiment.  So just like hollywood  but in india  At barely legal age  19 I think    Kangana had an affair with a married dude who later assaulted her and he s been accused of underaged diddling. Don t let Bollywood fool you.  ....lol  The indians aren  39 t hard up for Chinese.... Money.  Bollywood action movies are a great gift to man kind.  So celebrities are aloud to speak out only if they agree with you   In India she is considered an attention seeker.  But she is gonna be banned soon.  Meanwhile... Hollywood stars are too scared to speak up.  Of course  they are one Chinese tantrum away from being unemployable in Hollywood.  Same thing is happening in Washington DC  and in every major news organization in the country.  They re not scared  they agree with it  lol. exactly. Hollywood has been beating the  quot Trump is bad quot  drum for years now.  Maybe they don  39 t want an Orwellian situation where the government can force private companies to plaster the face and slogan of the leader onto their products. Who knows.  Unless you re James Woods.  In which case the left tries to silence and push him out of work. But if the right were to do the same stunts  there would be outrage and  em gasp  em  rioting.  Or  Randy Quaid  Mental illness is a Terrible thing   Or Hercules  Panderin in mandarin  Hollywood stars are reprobate perverts. Expect nothing from those trashbins  In India  being conservative is generally not so uncommon looked down upon  and Indian Twitter is also right leaning. Basically  what I want to say is that being a conservative in India is not as hard as being a conservative in the USA.  Indian Twitter is right leaning because of users but lots of old media is still left.Unfortunately Twitter shadow bans many popular right wingers to help left.  I  39 m pretty centrist regarding our country  39 s issues  but recently  the right wing mainstream media is also catching up  imo.  It is but now they are trying to silence Arnab by hook or crook.  And you are mad about that  It is about time. I was getting sick of seeing out of touch celebrities weigh in on issues.  Nah  they re speaking up  and some are asking when the last time an actor assassinated a president   deleted   I mean if they speak up or go against the narrative grain they get black listed and their careers are over. A lot of prominent early 2000s actors out of the spot light because of it  Such as   With more foreign influencers from non western governments speaking out about this shows how far western civilization has fallen. However  it does give me some hope that If the US ever falls than there are other countries out there that might take the mantle of the United States ideology of rights and governance.  People outside of the United States have a very different perspective on what is happening.  This is it.  Foreign country here   this is not my experience. My news is very heavily Trump focused  so I  39 m aware of a lot of the last 4 years highlights almost as much as a US viewer.  This is such a good point. they  39 re treating it as a 9 11 style terrorist attack. The 60 minutes preview  I wouldn  39 t watch such garbage  was an absolute hyperbolic joke. Though I would expect nothing less from our awful media.  Trump is an amazing way for Canadians to forget that our own leader is an actual traitor criminal and getting away with it.  Before Trump should be banned those Chinese motherfuckers  wolf warriors  should be the first ones.  Vladimir Putin openly stated in an interview the moment a country disobeys it s own constitution is when we interfere. Paraphrased  of course  but it s something to think about in terms of outcome.  Yeah and than he Just changed constitution for his needs  And the Democrats are breaking their own rules but we can  39 t call that out  apparently.  Not on Twitter or Parlor  at least.  source please   India loves Trump  FYI.  I like the Indian people  I work with a lot of them. Fine people.  That sounds like a Trump quote  except it needs an exclamation point at the end  and it s true  they are decent and hard working .   quot Some of the best. Everybody knows it. quot   I have tons of Indian friends. Very hardworking smart people.  There is a gas station between me and my work that an indian guy owns. He s a really cool guy  and I used to go in there so much that he gave me a coffee one morning on the house because I was constantly in there buying stuff. Always smiling  always cheerful  and I ve never met a guy that loved American values more than him.  This is true.  Also because India despises China and Trump clearly hates China as well.  Seattle tech guy and I can 100  confirm  Ironically it  39 s because they are caught up in Identity politics. They like the anti Islamic rhetoric  am Indian   And India hates China  a href  https   www.google.com search q india china amp source lnms amp tbm nws amp sa X amp ved 2ahUKEwiT4bjAnZPuAhWj1FkKHQwJDrwQ AUoAXoECDMQAw amp biw 1269 amp bih 842  https   www.google.com search q india china amp source lnms amp tbm nws amp sa X amp ved 2ahUKEwiT4bjAnZPuAhWj1FkKHQwJDrwQ AUoAXoECDMQAw amp biw 1269 amp bih 842  a   India loves Trump because India and Trump hate China.  It s because India is probably the largest threat in the region to Chinese power. And China has totally bought Dems and Silicon Valley.  Yeah. India is a very good counter to Chinese madness.  Indian born in Punjab raised in the USA can confirm we  Sikh community is all for trumps and family s value conservative values. Proud to be an American sad to see people so blind to the obvious destruction to our democracy  Fuck yeah   India is a country that tried socialism and it failed. Now they are growing strong and quickly turning around the tides of poverty with capitalism. It s funny you ll never see democrats discuss India.  Inda has been plagued with major corruption issues in their extensive bureaucracy. You think election fraud is bad in the US  You should see elections in some parts of India  Yeah  they distribute money and liquor just before the elections  even though it is illegal. Indian elections have a lot of funny business going on. Corruption is very deep over here.  Lol no. This is so wrong on many levels. But as expected such bias will always be upvoted in this subreddit.  Lmao no. I  39 m Indian and the Indian govt is fucking trash regardless of party. They  39 re so corrupt and corporations fuck over every normal person. The govt actively lets companies poison their own people for money  To me it seems like non Americans such as Indians and Hong Kongers like Trump more than Americans  No they don  39 t. They hate censorship that  39 s it.  Bet she  39 s banned by Tuesday  I ll give  em 11 minutes  Found the optimist   The rest of the world sees how dangerous this is   We need more people to be vocal about censorship. Let the whole world learn from the folly of the Americans.  Folly of big tech and rabid leftists   How do you know they aren  39 t   That  39 s the point of censorship     Flaired users only.  Make no mistake. The leftists in silicon valley are pushing authoritarian censorship for their own ideological reasons.  The country is on a fast track to a Left wing authoritarian style government.  Do you actually think this   Sadly  yes.  Soon any kind of right leaning speech will be banned from Twitter or Facebook.  This very sub we  39 re posting on probably won  39 t be here much longer.  You re massively overreacting.    strong flaired users only  strong   Who do you think has the most authority in the United States  The government. If a single person were to be selected  then it would be the President.   I am not a Republican but often vote for the Republican candidate. Republicans need to scream from the rooftops what is happening in America. Freedom of speech is being attacked. Everyone ought to be afraid   What the hell does Trumps childish stunts have to do with Islam or China   I agree with her  in part  however some the people behind this political purge are Indian immigrants working at high levels of many of the big tech corporations.  If so  they are probably on H1B visas and have no choice. If they lose their jobs they have to leave the country if they can  39 t find another within 60 days. Trying to lower the amount of H1Bs was one of the major reasons big tech hated Trump.  People at at that higher level of management would be already citizens or permanent residents.  This lady knows the deal.  All these tech giants have been bought  amp   have sold out to China.  Looks like this was from at least a few years ago. But is truer today than ever. Edit  Jack  39 s tweet was from 2015  but her reply was recent.  There is a particular irony in the anti censorship fervor across the sub where a vast majority of posts get tagged for flaired users only.  I didn  39 t think of this  lol   Liberal here with a legitimate question. Isn t the flaired users only thing a form of censorship on your part  Thanks in advance for any answers. Enjoy your day.  The world needs more Bollywood. Change my mind.  CHINA JOE .... BINGO  Yeah but trump has a literal press room. He s not a victim.  She  39 s right you know  Twitter and leftists are so sensitive they can  39 t handle a different opinion anymore....  Just checking to see if I can comment since everything in this sub has been flair only.  As an Indian immigrant  came here in 1st grade but whatever . Indians love Trump      As an Indian resident  please don  39 t generalize  The only glimmer of hope I see right now is the backlash over the bans. If they can ban Trump  they can ban anyone.  So  we  39 re cool with celebrities making statements on politics as long as they agree with us   I didn  39 t know who this was  but I do now   thank you Kangana.  If people in other countries see there s a problem. Why can the dems   The fact that others see it across nations.... We need more of Kangana.  Indian here. Kangana Ranaut isn  39 t really a good person to have on your side lol. The woman is nuts.  The left has always been about banning free speech they don t like. Just try and bring any conservative to an American university. The Twitter van will be used by China and Iran and Russia to justify their own censorship.  I  39 m loving India right now. Only if they economy can match up to China  39 s asap.  Whether you agree or disagree with someone  39 s ideas  you don  39 t defeat their ideas by banning them  but you defeat them by refuting them with evidence. Banning the ideas of others is a form of intellectual bankruptcy   I disagree with what you say but will fight to my last breath to defend your right to say it.   While I disagree with Twitter banning Trump  they did not do it for gain or greed. Twitter lost  10  of their value in stocks because of this. In fact  they might get in trouble for taking an action that hurts their stock holder s interests.  It s almost like companies try to make money. Huh fascinating  People are starting to wake tf up   Well  she s not wrong.  It s a slippery slope  and those in the part of the world that have seen authoritarian regimes are in a good position to know.  Imagine being upset about extremists being banned from a forum they pay nothing to use.  Twitter isn t banning Islamic terrorists. That s the problem.  SomeBlackGuy on youtube got banned from Twitter after this  and he s not even conservative.   We wont give a fuck because it s twitter  Sooo twitter taught me that doubting election results and wanting to investigate is totally illegal but a government bragging about how they re setting up concentration camps  that s just fine. You re also allowed to call for burning books and science written by people of a certain skin color.  Amen to this.  Maybe if the best sources you can find to agree with you are Bollywood stars no one has ever heard of  you are on the wrong side of things.  Lads as an Indian. And as someone who understands conservatives. Trust me she  39 s an absolute moron. Has no brains and will take every opportunity to ride the limelight.  Yep  she  39 s doing this to gain some following but truthfully  she has no dog in this fight. America and India are different landscapes politically.  I wouldn  39 t say we  39 re so different man. We  39 ve both got absolute morons in charge and both our populations are filled with idiots.  True that  But just a tiny bit of contrast   over here the liberal parties have lost sight of what they stand for while over in the US it  39 s the conservative.   So now we do care what actors think   these fools are stuggling to find anyone who agrees with them....  I kept thinking this said dollywood. lol.  Glad to see that bollywood isn  39 t as corrupted as Hollywood  Explain how companies make more money by having less users when they make money off of ads   If it s about money and greed  wouldn t it make more sense to NOT ban one of your most prolific users    Her opinion is important   s  Proof  Links  None.  Who cares what an actor thinks.  Why can  39 t I comment on any other post in this sub

She s having a TDS orgasmic meltdown.  For the love of God man  please don  39 t ever use the word orgasmic in sentence about pelosi. I wish my brain could get the clinton laptop treatment now.  Like with a cloth   Sorry    TDS be brutal tho..  She wants to diddle him and he laughed at her. That s why she tore up those pages  it was a love letter she wrote for Trump  Remember her tearing up the papers that Trump  39 s  speech was written on    She is crazy as a shithouse rat.   Looks like one too.  She probably wants to give him a spanking.  So where are the charges against her for attempting a military coup   Don  39 t think the 25th amendment route will fly. They will impeach though  and already have a couple republican senators  they  39 ll certainly push for more.  Those Republicans are just shooting themselves in the foot. Most Republican agree that violence is bad but they also agree that it  39 s not Trump  39 s fault. Saying that he incited the violence is complete bs.  Its also petty and not very strategic on their part either.  Take Romney for example  we know he very much dislikes Trump  but if he votes to impeach he  39 s pour fuel on the fire of party infighting  not a smart long term play even for his own prospects.  On the other he can just say   Their goal is to make it so he won  39 t even be able to run for a second term. Its total bs because all that does is take an option away from the American people. He should be able to run again and if he wins than that is the will of the people.  He  39 ll be 78 and come with a load of baggage.  The Dems would be salivating at him running again  even better if he could do it as a 3rd Party and split the vote.  No  this move is to try and smear all the people around Trump  incite a full on Republican civil war  and shore up Pelosi  39 s own left flank.  Its not actually about Trump.  Oh  yeah that makes more sense. I was just looking at the legal ramifications of this. Not the political fallout.  He s wrong  it s about disqualifying Trump  that s why the press is already talking about how all it would take is a majority to stop someone from running again.   Nope  Trump is the most formidable person in the Republican Party  and one of the few who can lead it into the future  past the corporate cronyism and elitism that has plagued it in recent years  shout out to Loeffler for trading on insider information ahead of the pandemic. Remember it s Trump s fault we lost those seats.   Romney knows his career is over  he does what he does now out of spite  even though the people he supposedly represents don t want it. Funny how the whole conservative movement  including myself sadly  held him as a pillar of virtue just 7 or 8 years ago.  Thanks for the useless paywall link.  Much appreciated.  s

WCCP  add West not 2.0  It would ve gone more smoothly for them if it weren t for the great voter turnout for Trump on Nov 3rd. If not for the controversy between then til Jan 6th their transition plans would ve looked natural. It just looks commie now because they are kicking it into overdrive now that the EC has been counted and nothing stands in the new administration s way. They are fitting two months into two weeks essentially.  Trump  39 s great turnout made their cheating more visible. they had to pull out all the stops to  quot beat him. quot   Their puppet has been dragging across the ground toward the finish line since election night. Had it all been easy making the small rounds in the public eye and the media polishing any doubt around their prefered candidate until early Nov. I mean the  president elect  was already conversing with other world leaders and had already thrown BLM under the bus post election.

Biden doesnt even need to ban online sales of guns and ammo  Hosting companies will just boot gun stores just because.  When you boot someone off like that  you should be required to answer why you didn  39 t give the slightest hint of a fuck about them being on your server for as long as they were prior to a bunch of tech lords  quot coincidentally quot  deplatforming them at the same time.  If they have some kind of moral objection to taking their money now  seems like they should refund all of it retroactively.  When Biden said that we had dark days ahead  he was right. He and his supporters are going to cause them.  Did they deplatform them because it s racist to buy and sell black guns   Good thing I only buy gold plated guns.  just sheer insanity  Guess I have some domains to move.  But why

Plenty more lawyers  Not Lin Wood again.  I guarantee there is a coalition of Peter Thiel style billionaires hiring the best lawyers in the country for this.  Probably starting with Randaza out of Vegas.  Republicans had six years to do something about big tech and did nothing.   a href   r news   r news  a  has been celebrating all day. They love it.  Those morons keep denying that this is censorship  completely forgetting that corporate censorship is a thing.  They only care when it happens to them.  They ONLY care about anything when it  39 s adverse for them  but cheer it when it  39 s to hurt who they  em perceive  em  as their enemy.  I mean to be fair  most  quot politics quot  is just rooting for your own team in america. Idiots on all sides  no one is immune.  You will find conservatives here criticise republicans. I challenge you to find the political mirror equivalent on the rest of reddit.  I like to browse many policial subreddits  if only to hear the opposition directly rather than paint a straw man of them .  a href   r Politics   r Politics  a  is pretty circle jerky when it comes to only criticizing the right  but smaller  more left leaning subs  especially for particular candidates  tend to criticize their centrist counterparts.   I think nearly everyone outside the big echo chambers can agree that neolibs and neocons are scum   a href   r stupidpol  r stupidpol  a  is the only lefty sub that I  39 ve come across which tends to  instead of attacking centrists  attack the insane behavior of those far left. Specifically attacking stuff regarding identity politics. You would almost think it was a right wing sub  even  If they cared about police brutality they would be outraged an unarmed woman got shot in the neck at the capital  with others dying as well. They care about victimhood and division  stroking their own egos  and feeling superior.  Remember when cops was bad  and government was racist  Now cops should be respected  and government is perfect  HOW DARE YOU PROTEST   Tools of the authoritarian state they now control.  Flippity flop   quot Actually  no  they have too much power. quot   But this IS their pathetic life. They have nothing else to do.  Funny that you have so many upvotes they can t downvote fast enough. I love it when leftards get triggered  Yep lol  they re insufferable. Though I do love when they try to reply to me and I m able to see it in my notifications  yet they re not actually under my comment. It s absolutely wonderful.  Why do you think that is  Do you think that the mods are censoring lib leftists   It s because of the  Flaired Users Only  flair under the post. If you aren t flaired  your comment gets deleted.  If they didn  39 t  this place would mirror  a href   r politics  r politics  a . They vastly outnumber us. They would try to take us over and you  39 d never see a conservative post because they would bury it with downvotes. Libs lefties LOVE censorship.  More accurately it s Sherman Act. They re shutting down one company customer  Parler  by claiming terms of service violation  while letting another  Twitter  violate those same terms. There is violent rhetoric on both sides. Planning and coordination of  protests  on both sides. You can t have one without the other. You can t say one is x and the other isn t.   I  39 m pretty sure Antifa used Facebook to coordinate their own terroristic riots. These people don  39 t care about consistency  they only care about silencing those they disagree with.  I know they  39 re active on Twitter based on all the death threats you can find in the replies to his tweets  Yeah but still I think in this particular case  they want us to think it  39 s about silencing us more than they just don  39 t want competition and this is a good excuse to snuff it out.  They care first and foremost about the stock price.  It s sad how they seem to not think social media companies and big tech wouldn t be operating in the exact same manner against left leaning groups if the incoming government was majority conservative and blamed their platforms for allowing a violent act on the capitol. Yes it s extra convenient for big tech because they do politically align with the left  but their first mission is to remain in their overwhelmingly powerful  monopoly  too big to fail status at all costs. Whenever there is the threat of possible legislation  actual updating anti trust competition law to be better in regards to the digital economy  etc they will do whatever they can to be seen as being on the right side of things.   They do not politically align with the left  only with themselves. If the right offered them new legislation that  39 d screw their competition harder than the left  39 s censorship and taxation  they  39 d be  quot right wing quot .  When have they been highly concerned about the amount of power massive corporations have over the public  Might be my Gen Z showing  but they ve been handing over their liberties on a platter to Big Daddy Megacorporations as long as I can remember  At the same time they are thinking they are anti establishment.  The  quot resistance quot .  They  39 re genuinely stupid enough that they don  39 t realize that their entire political party is made up of and relies on massive corporations.  They still think the Democrats are the party of the little guy  the average working class American.  Couldn  39 t be further from the truth.  The people running their party are a bunch of rich CEOs and politicians who  39 ve made a fortune through backdoor deals.  Because the TV told them to. Bunch of sheep. I question everything   even Trump.  Hope they win their anti trust lawsuit  BAKE THE CAKE BIGOT   Yep. They want to force companies to bake cakes for gay weddings  yet they  39 re totally okay with massive Big Tech companies denying service to people over political ideology.  I  39 m starting to lean toward forcing publicly traded companies to follow constitutional free speech principles.  Yeah  I  39 m not sure what the correct course of action should be  legally. But there  39 s clearly an issue. The first step to fixing a problem is identifying it. Ideally  I  39 d like for these companies to listen to the public outcry and choose to stop censoring on their own.  That ain  39 t gonna happen unless we can all agree to make it happen  unfortunately   removed    a href   r lotrmemes  r lotrmemes  a  has some posts about it but luckily there  39 s a no politics rule and the mods are good about removing them  I m a mod there. I ve been a tad inactive lately  but we got some pretty based lads on the team  and we definitely try to remove political shit when we see it.  It  39 s one of my favorite meme subs for that reason. I like my politics in my politics subs  not my meme subs. Keep up the good work. Love that place  Thanks mate. As a redditor I feel the same way for sure  that s definitely influenced how I moderate.  This is how democracy ends. With thunderous applause.  No better time has there been to speak this quote.   deleted   their mods probably do too  seeing as they perma ban conservatives for being conservative. it  39 s impressive how they manage to run their sub even worse than rpolitics.  It  39 s natural for authoritarians. They don  39 t care what happens or how many rights they lose as long as the authortarians crush their political rivals first. They could be told that they will be getting shot tomorrow and would happily agree with it if it meant they get to watch their enemies shot today.  I wish him luck but what can he do at this point  These Big Tech giants are way more powerful and influential. Parler by comparison is the ultimate underdog.  Unless I am mistaken  the ACLU are partisan hacks now.  they actually made a statement about how this kind of censorship is dangerous and could backfire and be used against POC.  We care about gay black people and we  39 re finally realizing that if this was a right wing tech company this wouldn  39 t be good so I guess we  39 re stuck supporting the bad guys for once  At the end of the day censorship hurts everyone  and the push towards true conservatism is good for all who cherish their individual rights.  Agreed. I  39 m only making fun at the pretzel logic that got them to this conclusion.   Pretzel logic  I m stealing that one haha  They  39 re pretty libertarian  but more left leaning beltway libertarians who align with democrats. They  39 re still pretty based on government free speech restriction and nat sec issues.  If Microsoft can be sued for stifling Netscape then then I don t see why Apple  Google and Amazon can t be sued for shutting down Parler. I haven t seen anything on Parler as bad as what I ve seen on Twitter.   It is protected by the same laws that Twitter and Facebook take advantage of. So naturally we get to watch the democrats strip away at 230 protections to get rid of parler  which will in turn put checks on Twitter and Facebook.  Two words  selective enforcement.  The neo leftist authoritarians running these tech companies   aka woke millennials and gen y ers  are so blinded by their self righteousness they re willing to annihilate anything that stands in their way. The Constitution  free speech  and the small businesses that are the backbone of this country.   removed   here  39 s hoping you  39 re right  but with everything I  39 ve seen from this spineless court  I don  39 t hold out hope.  Would they have standing in court  We honestly dont know these days  If Twitter can do anything because they are a private company then the rest of business can be open and do what they want  It  39 s less a  quot twitter can do what they want quot  and more of a  quot the government can  39 t tell companies how to regulate political speech under current law quot  issue. Corporations like Twitter can be regulated  but not in ways that infringe on their constitutional rights. The courts have ruled that shutting down businesses for legitimate public safety concerns is constitutional  although it  39 s up to the government to prove that there are legitimate public safety concerns  and that their actions aren  39 t discriminatory.  Bake the cake  right   They have no principles. Confirmation bias all the way.  Not a wise course of action   these corporations are behemoths and can afford to tie up Parler in law fare for years.  The problem is that if nobody DOES anything they ll do it again. And right here is a perfect moment to strike back against these assholes  sure they won t be hurt that much but still better than bending the ass to take another hit.  The federal government  whats left of it  would need to do it. These technology companies are in some ways more powerful than even them.  Parler is either turning itself into a martyr or it  39 s  David vs Goliath. What. Needs to be done is that a class action lawsuit needs to be filed. Fuck these tech fascists  first the government destroys thousands of businesses with lockdowns and now the beneficiaries of the lockdowns are destroying  their smaller competitors.  That was the point the entire time.  The tech companies are going to get the Jack Ma treatment from the government at some point. But it will be too late by then.  I don  39 t see what basis he has for lawsuit.  Amazon reserves the right to terminate for any reason  including none.  I don t think so either. I imagine Amazon would have a clause in their contract giving them the right to terminate the service if certain conditions are met. They d merely argue in court that they had been met and gave fair warning of the cancellation.   gt  If it  39 s a civil lawsuit and they can prove that Amazon targeted them for political reasons they could sue for damages.  They could do but do they have the money to do it  From what I ve read they re really up against it and it s not clear the site will return as many hosting companies don t want to host them.  Potentially antitrust  I mean the collusion between these companies meets the standards for anti trust. But from my understanding the Governmwnt would have to bring that to court  You realize the last major anti trust action to succeed was the blocking of Staples and OfficeMax merger because antitrust law was last updates decades ago and really pertains more towards brick and mortar and physical goods operations and is 100  not up to date to deal with modern antitrust issues in our digital economy.   In 2011  AT amp T tried to buy T Mobile. The US government went so far as to have the Antitrust Division of the DoJ file a lawsuit to block the merger  after which AT amp T abandoned the attempted acquisition. It was just in 2015 that the government also blocked a merger between Staples and Office Depot  who bought OfficeMax  because of antitrust concerns.  Microsoft was what I would consider the last  Major  one.  Antitrust   coordinating and colluding with other major business partners to shut down competition and enforce a monopoly on a communication platform like twitter.  Antitrust  Amazon is openly coordinating with Google  Apple  Facebook  Twitter  etc to take out competition  We can t give up and neither can Parler. There has to be a way. The technology with cryptocurrency and a decentralized service. Everyone who uses it has a piece of the database or just their own uploads.  With Dems in charge of everything in just a few weeks  the feds with shut down Parler  Gab  Rumble  basically anywhere that allows republican conservative chat or intermingling.  The solution is probably building their own web hosting service.  Maybe im an old  old  OldTimer.  But this all brings up memories of Radio Free Europe.  This is the correct answer  This. A business has the right to deny service based on their policies. They should find other servers services if they want to continue to operate  instead of wasting resources pretending thet can overcome what is very solid legal ground for tech services companies.  Idk why you all think this is a cut and dry issue with an obvious answer. Plus  I thought you all stood for small government and allowing corporations to choose who they do business with  I mean fuck  if you guys aren t then I m on the wrong subreddit. This subreddit is  a href   r Conservative  r Conservative  a  not  a href   r DonaldTrump  r DonaldTrump  a  or even  a href   r Republican  r Republican  a  .. have some god damn standards.  100   big tech can make it increasingly inconvenient to use alt tech  but they can  39 t stop it. you can compile your  a href  https   www.chromium.org   own version of chrome  a .  There was a thing a little while back where poland would fine social media platforms for political censorship  I mean  this is coordinated anticompetitive behavior.  That just screams antitrust.  And collusion in doing so  I just talked to a friend of mine who thinks there is absolutely nothing wrong with what big tech is doing. He also defended the riots all last year but is now saying the right is out of control. I am genuinely confused how people can support this stuff. What a time.  Political discourse is dead. Everyone is interested in dealing in confirmation bias and nothing else.  Ding ding ding you just described 99  of people actually invested in politics. I hate to play the  I m a centrist  card but god damn the level of hypocrisy I see every time a new hot topic pops up is crazy. You guys and  a href   r Politics  r Politics  a  keep flip flopping sides like it s no big deal.    Thing is no one wants to host them and  we can use the whole private companies can do what they want it s their business but they aren t applying their standards equally seeing how many of the riots were organized on said platforms  If that s the case then you should take your business elsewhere. If you can t cause of a lack of options then the issue lies with these big corporations being monopolies and not with the  censorship  itself.  So than how does one fight them when the government itself is in bed with them therefore preventing any action being taken  So your solution is to use the government.. who is  in bed  with these companies  to fight the companies  Oof.  I mean idk what you aim to accomplish anyways  politicians accept donations and are bought by big corporations. Democrat or Republican  you re not convincing any of them to go after their additional source of income.  Our government is corrupt  I would really love to download Parler  except for them forcing me to give them my telephone number. I  39 ll sit here in silence  with my privacy more intact.  Phone numbers used to be listed in a book that got delivered to every home in the county. This is your sticking point    That was before robocalls and automated identity theft. There are many people who have not adopted it for this reason.  Time to decentralize.  Redevelop to host on decentralized platforms.  Use the technology storj sia use.  They cannot shit down all of is.  Besides  a social media platform that doesn t spy on user activity is a threat to big tech  On what grounds  Our leftist tech overlords write the terms and conditions  Probably anti trust that Twitter directly worked with apple and Microsoft to de platform its leading competitor   deleted   The laws are still there  When have laws or the constitution stop a good liberal policy.  Strongest case that I haven  39 t heard anyone say yet is a tortious interference claim  Surely someone with money in America still has principles and cares about free speech.  when they block you at every turn it is hard  Companies like Apple et al have nearly infinite monies  and legions of lawyers  to fight this type of suit. I hope Parler prevail  but somehow I think they will go bankrupt before they even see the inside of a courtroom.  Has anyone seen proof of Parler being directly responsible for the storming of the Capitol  We keep seeing how they are a collection of hate groups gathering  yet I ve yet to see any posts indicating they engage in Nazism.  I  39 ve personally seen one dumb comment by lin wood and other than that I seen FAR more comments made on Twitter and Facebook about the stop steal the Parler.  Lin Wood has actually been banned from Parler.  Even then. I d still wanna see solid proof on those claims. Not calling you a Liar. There s just so much damn misinformation on this site.  Don  39 t have the link anymore.  Its been taken down too.  Figures. I ve noticed YouTube is also taking down numerous videos of politicians adding fuel to the fire as well.  of course not  There is no denying it was a coordinated attack on such a fast schedule as to prevent any chance of them stopping it.  I mean yes  but that argument wouldn  39 t hold up in a court  Yeah I  39 m sure a white guy who runs a free speech website is going to be treated 100  fairly by the legal system and win a major landmark case.  I feel bad for him. This is pissing me off way more than twitter banning people.  As long as he stays humble and open to free discussion on his platform he will be insanely wealthy in no time    Best of luck to them. The tech companies are so powerful and they have the government  aka The Party  on their side. I wish them the best.  It  39 s unbelievably hypocritical that Google  Twitter  and Facebook benefit so much from and fight so hard to preserve the legal protection from being held liable for what users post on their platforms and then turn around and pull this shit on their competitors. In what world could it be legal for them to act like this  It  39 s clear and objective anti trust violations. Google is a vertical monopoly and is abusing this to remain a horizontal monopoly. Time for some good old fashioned trust busting.  That should take...wait a minute  a decade  Big tech has censored and banned the actual President of the United fucking States of America.  Look I  39 m all for the rights of private companies to do as they please but when these companies grow to the size and scope of utilities  its changes the game a little.  What if the power companies could deny service to people they didn  39 t like    they can  39 t .  These huge media companies like Apple  Facebook  Twitter  Google  Etc...they function almost as utilities at this point and being unable to use them is a crazy blow to any company that relies on their services.  This whole thing is nuts.  What a shame. It  39 s astonishing how the Left celebrates censorship  what has this country come to    racketeering and anti trust hoooooooo  Excuse my pessimism but if the Supreme Court didn t do anything about the election then they definitely won t help Parler  Those are two very different situations. I agree with McConnell that overturning the election now would start the death spiral of the US. This though is different situation entirely. I  39 d be surprised of they didn  39 t weigh in on this in Parlor  39 s favor.  Is Gab seriously the only alternative to Parler

If  quot trumpism quot  and MAGA are what happen when one party or segment of a party feel disenfranchised  marginalized and demonized for a generation  further marginalization will only entrench them.    I hate the be like the other side  but there is literally no difference between the relationship American mega corporations have with the Democrats and the relationship German corporations had with the NSDAP. I suppose the US government isn  39 t supplying them with slave labor  although it is enabling the utilization of it overseas.  The real irony is that the merger of corporate power with political power  called corporatism  was at the core of fascism in Mussolini  39 s Italy.

Soooo we can try and push this through in  a weeks time but we can t get Covid relief all fucking summer  I watched every second of the last impeachment. It was incredibly boring. I have zero interest in watching this time around.  Good  don t give C SPAN your views after what their hack  journalist  did with the presidential debate  They  39 ll get their views. The libtards will be drooling all over the place. For nothing though.  Since the left can  39 t fucking read  have trouble using their brains and use feelings over facts here  39 s the transcript  Democrats are a party of feelings.    a href  https   youtu.be DFPH4NCHZZo  rel  nofollow   We choose truth over facts    a   No the issue is the dems understand the word peaceful as meaning  quot riot  loot and cause violence quot .  s  Anyone have that video compilation of democrats urging violence during the protests    a href  https   m.youtube.com watch v nw9kyYEwg2A  https   m.youtube.com watch v nw9kyYEwg2A  a   Thanks. Surprised this is still allowed to remain on TY. Anyway to download it before it gets taken off    a href  https   yt1s.com   rel  nofollow  https   yt1s.com   a   But see if you interpret   quot peacefully and patriotically  quot  it really dose not mean peaceful   s  You shouldn t expect congress to know what  incite  means.  It s above their pay grade.  Careful now  that sounds a lot like logic.  Remember how they just lied about the  quot good people on both sides. quot  They don  39 t care.  They are terrified of him coming back in 4 years...  No  Democrats want to the Trump impeachment to become an albatross for RepublicanSenators to vote no on conviction. They simply don t have the votes to convict.    Florida covid response was not perfect. But it was about as close as we got.         Fuck Andrew Cuomo.  Eww you  39 d fuck that pos   I have a very smart ass response I  39 d love to post  but I  39 ll just agree that he is a pos.  I  39 m just messing with ya lol I  39 m surprised anyone could let alone would fuck him...  I can  39 t believe Cuomo let life saving vaccines expire on the shelf  while fining hospitals millions of dollars for vaccinating unapproved patients  yet people still don  39 t recognize him for the tyrant he is. This incompetence and malice would have given Stalin a run for his money.  Trump can run again in 2024  but I would rather he didn  39 t. He has had his turn  and this is how it ends  No  someone else needs to take up the reins or we  39 re going to be swinging between Obama style politics and Trump style politics for a long time to come.  They also want vengeance for the last 4 years.  Crazy seeing as they don  39 t realize that shitshow on the 6th was people fired the fuck up over what they pulled over the past 4 years.  Those blinded by hate only see what they wish to see.  It  39 s a problem as old as man.  Nah.  That would be the greatest gift they could receive.  He  39 d never win the primary but he would torch everyone else on the stage.  Or else run as a Ross Perot third party candidate and hand the election to rival nominee Ilhan Omar  D   Al Shabab .   and hand the election to rival nominee Ilhan Omar  D Al Shabab     If Trump was actually planning an insurrection  things would have went much differently.  Any of these people calling the ruckus on the 6th a   39 failed coup d  39 etat  39  have literally no fucking clue how a coup works.  They  39 ve never been to countries with actual coups  if anything their push for impeachment is more coup like than anything.  What flavor ice cream though because we know those are the important questions for the left   quot A double scoop of Prune  with Bran sprinkles  quot   So much unity. I love it. This will really bring the country together   United on the path to Hell.  Amazing the mental gymnastics they go through.  Two things have I to say about this.  Firstly  he told the protestors to peacefully disperse when they got too rowdy  but video evidence of this fact keeps getting taken down.  Therefore the charges of insurrection are completely bogus.  Secondly  while I would like Trump to assume a second term  I grow more disturbed by Republicans exhibiting increasingly cult like behavior towards the man.  When you treat a single man as some sort of savior  nothing but trouble will follow. There is much that I appreciate about his last four years of office  including the reinvigoration of the conservative base  but it will become necessary for that torch to be passed to others.  I agree. The torch will be passed after his second term is served  whether that s 2021 2025 or 2025 2029.  Yep. Trump is not done yet that s the thing. Referencing the word cult is a debasing and derogatory statement straight from the lefts playbook. What s disturbing to me is that republicans are calling other republicans cult followers ....  I  39 m not a Republican though.  I vote for Republicans  and occasionally for Libertarians  but I never have felt comfortable registering as one because I have a problem with the two party system.  Also  the party has a lot of warmongers  and I have a severe problem with that. Otherwise my views tend to line up with theirs enough that I vote for them.  I  39 m an independent conservative.  I used the word  quot cult like quot  because it  39 s accurate.  There are Republicans who treat Trump like he  39 s some sort of messiah figure  and that  39 s really concerning to me.  I generally like his policies  and I had hoped that he would get elected instead of the incoming scumbag  but the conservative movement cannot place its hope in one man.  To do so is foolishness at best.  If anything  we need principled men in power who are not elderly.  Right now we need unity and one man who provides a symbol can help accomplish that  totally agree with your points but at the end of the day there are crazies in all walks of life and to single out tump supporters for  cult like  behaviors is a useless gesture. There will never be a candidate anywhere without people like this that follow them. All this tells me is that the socialist propaganda machine has influenced the thinking of many people even on the opposite side of the fence...  Believe what you want. I try to observe everything through as critical of a lens as I can  and I  39 ve been observing the Republicans especially over the last 4 years.  There is no propaganda at play here.  I made my comment due to the behavior I have witnessed  not because of someone else  39 s talking points.  Could you describe your concerns without invoking any lefty buzzwords  Lets shift away from cult entirely   is there another way to frame the issue you perceive   I deny the premise that it  39 s a  quot lefty buzzword quot   but I will indulge you.  My concern is that many Republicans are placing excessive faith in Trump to fix everything that  39 s wrong with the system  sometimes even to the point of laws and procedures be damned.  I  39 ve witnessed people online and in person that say we should elect other members of his family after he serves two terms  or that he should run again after sitting out a term. I intrinsically distrust people who fawn over those in power.  Does that help   There was nothing to help my friend  I simply offered you an opportunity to clarify your position. It seems that the main issue is that extreme trump supporters are seemingly willing to violate law and order to get what they feel is right. Do you share the same concern for Biden supporters  In general they re quite a bit more radicalized. Or is this less of an issue since you do not vote blue anyway   Anyone who currently votes Blue concerns me to some degree  and with the extreme ones it  39 s far beyond simple concern. That  39 s a separate issue. But my concern with a lot of Trump supporters  and I am a Trump supporter  is not only those who are willing to violate the law.  My concern is that their trust is in a man instead of deeds.  Wait I thought the Dems already impeached him already   Guess that didn t work out as they hoped.  Trump 24   Trump will be president in 2024. And 2021  2022  2023.  I mean let s be realistic...he s not going to be kept in office at the end of this month  no matter how bad we all want that.  I don t understand how some of us to get that already  the legal battles played out and we couldn t gather the evidence needed to build a cased. Sworn statements can only go so far. Time to accept the shit show that will be the next 2 4 years and build a better party that can combine classic conservatism with modern society .  I m hoping Trump works on his public image over 4 years and comes back with a vengeance   quot Everything from the left is projection. quot    Mark Dice  2020.  Imagine accusing a sitting president of trying to overthrow his own government.

Well the poll that claims his approval rating declined was from the same pollster that had him down by 6  in Florida  These polls are clearly seditious and inciting terrorism.

t3_kukm7q,Marriott Blue Cross Blue Shield and Commerce Bancshare stop donations to all 147 Republicans who opposed Certifying Biden as President Ford Bank of America CVS Target ATampT Berkshire Hathaway and Exxon Mobil are also considering similar policies,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kukm7q/marriott_blue_cross_blue_shield_and_commerce/,Everyone stop donating to politicians   Politicians should have real jobs and not need to be bought and paid for by the highest bidder  Well that  39 s true too.  Not sure if it would help us  but Singapore pays their politicians a lot of money to try and deter corruption. Over  1M USD at the top.  Yeah right they should get  50k a year and free bologna sandwiches for lunch. If they dont like it don  39 t be a  quot public servant quot .  All that would do is give pukeosi an additional 800K year.  And an effective auditing system to fix the billions of waste abuse....  Amen  And awoman    I believe the state they represent should provide quarters  a stipend  and a small expense account to maintain themselves in DC and while on business.   How about predominantly centrally funding campaigns with low caps on donations and much stricter campaign finance laws   They don  39 t care about donations either way  all that would do is give them more money in addition to what they get from lobbyists and special interest groups.  Donations should be only allowed from registered voters  and no  quot bundling quot .  And you must remember ultimately it all goes to the Media to pay for all that air time.  Democrat  Republican it doesn  39 t matter it all goes to the Media.  You do realize that the money doesn  39 t go directly to the politician to use as he pleases  right  It goes to their campaign or related organizations.  Ask Omar how that  39 s going. She can  39 t take the money  but she sure as shit can funnel millions to her husband.  They ll donate again later when the heat is off.  Nice flair  Also tons of Dems did same thing in Bush years. There acting like this is new. Double standards again. Thinking Antifa might be right....this country is fucked anyways.  Is this supposed to be good PR for these assholes  Reminding people that our political system is run by lobbyists like them   This was my first thought as well. I m almost 100  sure that the majority of people were unaware that these companies donated directly toward politicians in the first place. All they did was highlight how much of our government is owned by private corporations.  I didn t have much hope for the majority of our voter base anyway. Apparently  millions of people voted for a racist  possible rapist  establishment politician  who has had a less than mediocre nearly 50 year political career  and who very likely has dementia.  And has been proven to be corrupt 100   You guys forgot blatantly racist.  Somebody said on a different post that these companies know conservatives don  39 t take things personal or something to that effect. So they have nothing to worry about shitting all over conservatives.   The most frustrating thing in the world is trying to get my conservative friends to wake up.   quot Oh they are coming after us  Huh  shrugs shoulder  I don  39 t have Facebook anyway so when is the game on Sunday  quot   Im keeping tabs on all these companies. They  39 ll never see a red cent from my family again. Already deleted accounts and sold stock  will gladly keep going. Bitcoin is going through the roof anyway  Oh no  This   74 million people voted for Trump. That can make a huge impact financially.  We need to make it impactful by not using these companies. Bank of America is anti gun anyways and I won  39 t bank with them. I haven  39 t bought ExxonMobil gas since the the Valdise incident when their drunk captain ran their oil tanker aground. Going forward I won  39 t be visiting any Marriott hotels and so on. There are so many alternatives in the market place people can easily change their buying habits without any affect to their lives. But if enough of us do it there will be an impact to these companies.  They aren  39 t afraid of our impact.  The amount of frenzied virtue signaling is incredible.  I  39 m so disturbed by this woke capitalism. It  39 s kind of freaky seeing all these corporations virtue signal in some desperate attempt to get some more brand recognition. You gotta think that it  39 s gonna backfire  right  Or have they realized that half the country is enough to sustain their businesses   It  39 s the cool thing to do. In a few months when everyone forgets they  39 ll go back to their quid pro Joe deals.   But think of the woke points    This wouldn  39 t even be news or an issue if corporations couldn  39 t make political contributions in the first place.  I agree we need a separation of corporations and state far more than church and state and for the same reasons.  Well the good news is that the  quot two party system quot  won  39 t be an issue any more.  The irony here is these dimwits in the GOP fought to give massive tax breaks to all these corporations. They even made sure the democrats can t pass any single payer healthcare system that will hurt insurance companies like Blue Cross Blue Shields. And now these same companies are going to cut off republicans and fund democrat politicians.  Don  39 t worry. The Democrats will be all too happy to take those bribes   I mean campaign contributions to carve out tax exceptions for those companies  Spot on.  it  39 s already a one party system.   if these organizations were donating to these politicians  then that means they had special interest. Now all these politicians have to do is basically ignore their special interests  and actually just work against them  Lol.  Biden said so himself that he  39 s gonna kill the fossil fuel industry.  Oh cool  blue cross  the only provider in FL and the cheapest coverage I could get was like  700 a month....lawl.  See  their bribes  err   quot donations quot  worked fine for them.  What the actual fuck  that was after your employer paid their part   Good. Stop donating. Period.  Good. The GOP should fully embrace the working class.  Shapiro predicted we d end up with this kind of segregation capitalism but I didn t think it would happen so fast.  Were literally  10 days into bidens presidency and this shit is happening.  You haven t seen a thing yet. They aren t even in power yet. The amount of moves on day one will be shocking.  This is how democracy dies.  And with applause  no less.  expect alot more   these companies outing themselves  But Republicans are the party of the elite  rich and corporate world     Wow so billion dollar corporations arent supporting Republicans and are in lock step with the Democrats  I thought the Democratic party was for the working people     Neither party is. Only one person in DC is and that s President Trump and they re trying to remove him.  Damn right.  Imagine being a leftist and seeing this.    They are boycotting people who are poorly representing their interests. I don  39 t get why this thread thinks this is a bad look for Dems. No where does this article point to anything depicting that. It is just ragging on the idiots who still insist the election was  quot stolen quot .  The Republicans under corporate financial threat should wear this  loss  of corporate support as a badge of honor and make it a central campaign issue.  Boycott these fuckers. Someone should create an app with GPS capabilities that notifies you when you are about to patronize a woke business. They are already spying on me and tracking my every move I might as well get a warning when I  39 m about to get fucked.  That  39 s a good idea for an app and definitely feasible. Just don  39 t host the database of  quot woke quot  companies on AWS  Amazon   Azure  Microsoft   or GCP  Google .  All the  app would need is a feature allowing the user the ability to highlight certain businesses that meet certain criteria. Boycott lists could be completely separate from the app itself. It could be useful for leftists looking to boycott whoever they want as well. At this point I don  39 t really care. This game they are playing should offer both sides mutually assured destruction  maybe they will pull their heads out of their asses if everyone starts to take a hit. As they say  two can play at this game. The problem is  we need the tools to play since we don  39 t have all of the tech and news companies on our side.  Calculate the   39 woke coefficient  39  and inform people exactly which businesses contribute most to leftist causes.  This needs done now.  Yep. If you cancel us we cancel you.  Agreed but it ll get pulled off the stores ASAP  Don t these companies have fiduciary responsibility that precludes them from alienating a good percentage of their customers   The corporate economy has become an oligopoly  it s no longer capitalist. They don t have to answer to us anymore.  At some level the problem becomes who gets newly issued money... the elite businesses get new money  first so thats one reason we can  39 t stop them.  So we may have to visit how much the monetary system enables their stablility  Damn right.   We don  39 t have to use stupid old Twitter.  yes  go ahead and take it to court and try your hand at getting a social justice warrior for a judge. 2020 has made me more cynical than I ever thought I could be   em 2021 enters the chat  em   This. There is no more law. There is only power  influence  and force.  Fax  You could use that same argument to say that making donation to these politicians alienates their liberal customers. But in actuality no  corporations have no obligation to make political donations.  They probably found it was less costly than continuing to support them or are trying to profit from the free press. I doubt they have any actual morals.  One would think so  I ve seen people say  the people spoke  and the invisible hand moved their business to what the people wanted    deleted   I forget  which side is the fascists   Obviously us because we like personal liberty  Frankly  I think this makes those politicians more attractive candidates to me. I mean ... you mean to tell me some of these candidates might not be bankrolled by mega corporations and thus have relative free will and might have to listen to individual voters more and I m supposed to be less interested in voting for them  Frankly being it on  I ll at least have to consider donating to every single one who represents me. If I m on that list  I do everything I can to get on national tv and declare that I ll no longer be taking corporate donations and that I m expanding my local office hours to aid me in reconnecting with real people. I m making this a political feature and then shaming corporations every chance I get about how they use their money to subvert the republic. I m calling for hearings about reforming campaign finance by specifically excluding donations over 100 bucks by any one person. I mean  I m running wild with this and making as much noise as possible that I am no longer a corporate shill. See how long the corporations take to come crawling back with double their prior donations once that gets rolling.  we will still need leader after what going to happen.  And the fascist relationship between politically connected crony corporations and Democrats is exposed to the world. Well it already was but  yeah. This is the swamp. Most Republicans who aren  39 t on this list are part of the nwo global elite club as well.          To be fair this is the business move. If you can get banned from the internet for supporting republicans  and donations are public  Ford can  39 t risk donating to a conservative if it means Twitter will derank all their content and AWS is going to knock their servers offline. We need to break up some of the biggest tech  Google Apple  and build our own services to fulfill the rest.  There  39 s a Marriott I  39 ve been staying at about every third week for the last six months.  There are usually about 6 10 cars in the lot.  The manager told me  quot I think you are singlehandedly keeping us open quot  and they always upgrade me to a suite.  I  39 ll be letting them know tomorrow that I  39 ll no longer be staying there  and why.  And republicans are the fascists  I m so sick of all of this ridiculous hypocrisy. Soon you ll be thrown in jail if you aren t a full blown liberal. Great   I call bottom bunk   This will just end up dividing the country even further  raising tensions and hostility even further. We are eventually going to reach a breaking point and at this rate it may happen soon.  divide and conquer   a standard tactic of the ruthless  Here the left is all up in arms over an  attempted coup  last week and doesn t care about this. Make no mistake  this is a partnership between big companies and the left to destroy any rights you still have. It s getting scary.  Businesses shouldn t be allowed to donate to politicians anyway lol...  Well thanks for letting us know that you actively bribe politicians  It s easy to forget how often these companies do that  Hey Marriott  Blue Cross Blue Shield and Commerce Bancshare... thanks for letting us know which companies to permanently boycott. This financial tactic works both ways. I  39 ll never stay in a Marriott owned hotel again.  I don t even know what commerce bancshare is  This is the beginning of the end. Things in this country are about to get very strange.  Good  We need change in our government structure. Politicians need to represent the people and STOP being puppets controlled by corporations  And we need to implement term limits to the Senate and the House  Let them stop the donations and let it happen to the left when their time comes     Nothing is going to happen until conservatives do something and accept things are going to be different    This should be really a kick to the nuts for liberals. They should realize that their actions are Aligned with lobbyists and that should scare them. Their ideals should be for the people and companies should hate that. The fact that these companies are going to double up on lobbying to dems....   Democrats are the party of the elites now. Republicans are working class people.  Republicans HAVE to rebrand that way. There s no other choice.   We should be the individual liberty party but then we are weighed down by the religious right that isn  39 t a big fan of freedom and who want to tell people that they have to follow the rules of their book.  Agreed. Nothing wrong with religion as long as everyone understands its a personal matter. Its not meant to be used as a set of laws to govern the country.  I understand that but most of the most active young liberals I see tend to work minimum wage jobs. They re problem is going to be that they re going to start to feel alienated as they continually see corruption hit their leaders and watch the progressive aspect of the Democrats disappear  And thats why this kind of news isn  39 t going to get much coverage  and banned as   39 hate speech  39  and   39 incitement  39  and   39 misinformation  39  on social media  to make sure they  em don  39 t  em  hear about it.  Cancel my health insurance and find a new bank.  Just make your own   Wow  democrats and their corporate minions are really exercising their   39 unity  39  plan of CCP comrade Biden.  Lol they  39 re telling the world  quot we pick the winners quot  glorious  Ive already sold stock off from amazon  ill stop doing business with any company that decides their opinions are the only ones that matter. Parallel economy here we come   Lmao.  A bit short cited  no   What happens when the libs are voted out   Nothing happens. They aren  39 t going to be consistent with this  they are only going to target the right.  I think they know that they can keep stealing elections.  Nothing happened this time and it was rampant.  They will only keep changing laws to make it easier for them to commit voter fraud.  Seemed to happen in the GA senate elections too. They  39 ve got a successful process and no one stopped or punished them. I don  39 t think we  39 ll see a republican government for a long time.  Omg evil corporations will not donate to us  gasp   Ita almost as if the media and corporations are all in on it  Companies to not buy from o well.  Why yes  I see you  39 ve done your job and obeyed your oath and therefor your loosing our donations. Sorry but not sorry  They re sending a message. If you aren t in their little club  you cannot play their game  and anyone who tries to let them can t play either.  All this means to me is that Republicans are about to take less corporate money than the Democrats. According to  a href   r politics  rel  nofollow  r politics  a  that means the GOP is less corrupt.  Pay to play in effect  Keep scratching them off. Don  39 t like Marriott anyway  dropped Anthem and will gladly not buy Ford  39 s anymore  BoA is shit anyway. Don  39 t like CVS. Mom  amp  Pop shops  fuck Target. Verizon is better than AT amp T anyway. Don  39 t use anyting from Berkshire Hathaway that I know of and Exxon Mobil gas stations are all trash anyway.

I went to public school and thank god my parents saw what had been happening and had talks with us and other parents.  This shits been going on for a long time. Atleast 20 30  years. We re seeing it starting to take full effect now.  Then we need a majority home schooling.  I think rehydrate the Tea Party make it part of the MAGA party and end every RINOs career.  When did populism become a dirty word  You mean the will of the common people is a bad thing  Populism only rises in the face of tyranny.   Populism only rises in the face of tyranny.     deleted   Step one  control the lines of communication...  The next 4 years are going to really suck for those that care about our country and can see what  39 s happening to it. The problem that I have been saying all along is we are the not vile law breaking backstabbing kind therefore about all we can do is sit back take care of ours and watch it unfold like a terrible made for TV movie and  pray there is no sequel.  The stupid part of this is that you are going to drive reasonable Republicans Conservatives into the echo chambers of the lunatics which will radicalized even more of them.

t3_kurq4z,Marco Rubio says Republicans need to stop indulging Qtards and other wackos,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kurq4z/marco_rubio_says_republicans_need_to_stop/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  https   discord.gg conservative  a   He  39 s not wrong. Q  39 ists are a blight on the movement. They  39 ve wrapped their entire identities around a secret and nefarious being who feeds them a daily dose of bullshit without an iota of proof. Even Q  39 s first drop was fiction. The phraseology  the lexicon  all of it has been adopted by these poor dopes and it just tarnishes the entirety of what it means to be a conservative. There is no Q  there never was. The sooner people understand that the better of they will be. But oh no  if you even say it  you  39 re a shill. For whom  Who fucking knows. It  39 s just an easy dismissal for them to spout.  There is a Q. He  39 s a pig farmer named Jim Watkins living in the Philippines.  Qtards are not conservative  I  39 m sorry. Their beliefs do not reside within what is normally called the political spectrum.  What ever ideology they claim to have they are hijacking it for their own gain and purpose. These people need to be ostracized from society  I know some Q people sadly. They honestly believed Jan 6 was  the storm  or whatever. Trump would never denounce Q because he was the hero in that conspiracy.   They  39 ve been saying  quot The storm quot  was imminent for the last 3 years. A friend of mine is into Q and back in 2017 she put  quot RED quot  next to October on her calendar on her fridge because something  em huge  em  was supposed to happen. To this day she simultaneously admits Q has gotten some things wrong while saying every prediction he has made has come true 100 . Her excuse is that sometimes he intentionally throws misinformation out there to throw off the deep state.  Q seems to have a lot in common with  quot end times quot  obsessed evangelicals. They just don  39 t realize that by focusing on being a proper Christian you don  39 t need to obsess over the end times.  Jehovah  39 s Witnesses are actually one of the successors of Millerism alongside Seventh Day Adventists  and being exposed to both worlds  I see almost nothing but similarities. Living your life that way is rough to say the least. Just constant anxiety every time you wake up in the morning wondering if today is going to be  quot it. quot  When I left the JWs  letting go of that mindset was one of the greatest feelings.  Compares to Jehovah  39 s Witnesses   7th Day Adventists are sparkling water.  They have their  quot rules quot  but if you wanna eat meat  they  39 re supposed to be vegetarians  you can eat meat.  If you work on the Sabbath  where seventh day comes from   some may flip one shit but they won  39 t get kicked out or denounced.  They run huge healthcare organizations and obviously many work on the Sabbath.  They  39 re not supposed to drink caffeine but many guzzle coffee like the rest of us.  They  39 re not supposed to drink alcohol  but many of them are at the quickie Mart buying a 7 Eleven before football games fire up on a Sunday.    You d think they d get exhausted.  I wish Trump denounced Qtard shit when it started.  Denounce a group that sees him as some sort of literal savior   There  39 s no way his ego would allow that.  He s the hero of their world  he would never denounce it  And even if he did they  39 d contort themselves into knots to explain how he really is signaling support.  Are you kidding  Trump is a narcissist and this is literally a cult that he is the central figure of. Trump is not going to turn down worshippers no matter how crazy they are.  It s probably an ego thing or trump doesn t care enough to do anything about it.  Same  Even if he did you think they would care   same. He probably didn  39 t...cause votes. which I can understand. But he should have denounced them anyways.  IIRC they asked him to denounce it at a debate townhall and he didn  39 t even know what it was.  I don  39 t know much about them  but from everything I hear they  39 re just but job conspiracy people with Republican flavor. We don  39 t need that crazy.  Yeah  I  39 ve checked out several Q threads before to see what it is that these idiots talk about and it  39 s incredible.  They are nutjobs without a doubt but let them have their ideas and have their talks among each other. They are fine there.  They can talk amongst themselves  that  39 s fine. When they show up to a peaceful protest and make it a CNN  quot Peaceful Protest quot ... they have crossed the line and need to be shut down. Conservatives already have a hard time looking civil in the media  we don  39 t need radicals making it even more difficult.  I know a dude who got pretty heavily into the Q stuff. He was saying all this crazy shit like  Trump losing was all planned  just wait . And acting like Pence was going to be arrested for Treason. It s batshit crazy . The really sad thing is that he seems to have finally woken up to the fact that Biden is our president. Rather than question the crap that he s been fed for months  he is doubling down and saying that there is more corruption than they believed.  If a QAnoner makes it into heaven  and God himself told him that Q isn  39 t real  the QAnoner would just say  quot the conspiracy goes higher than I thought  quot   My mother in law is in deep. Sharing stuff with the family. The latest is that Trump will still be President  he never said Biden in his concession speech  and the next admin will be him and someone other than Pence.   My mom is a Jehovah  39 s Witness and my best friend is a QAnoner. It  39 s actually kind of scary how similar their warning texts to me are. What  39 s crazy is my best friend and I used to  em be  em  Jehovah  39 s Witnesses. We grew up being afraid of doomsday every day of our lives. When George H. W. Bush said  quot peace and security quot  during a state of the union address 30 years ago  my dad was jumping up and down on the couch like Tom Cruise yelling about the book of Revelation being fulfilled. One of the greatest things in my life was being free of that mindset. But I guess she  39 s just dependent on it and has to believe in doomsday no matter what the source is.  But your credit cards can cancel you if you support Trump.  Yeah maybe if Republicans weren t such weak fucks people wouldn t need the hopium of Q bullshit. Ryan and Mitch did nothing. They had no plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. Exactly what Conservative legislature did they get passed  Jack and shit.  My wife s cousin is big Q believer and keeps sending me messages about how  Marshall law  is coming. It s been coming since Nov. 4th apparently.   deleted   Think of Q as the place where the strangest and most outlandish conspiracies come from. Usually they will start with a fact and then run with it until the conclusion is   39 aliens or satan  39  ect..  Wait lol I didn  39 t know the gay frogs thing was actually based on something  It s called Atrazine. They weren t dumping it into a river. It is in our tap water. It s a pesticide that ends up making its way into tap water in small quantity. Some areas of the US have it a lot more than others. A scientist experiments with frogs and atrazine and finds out that the frogs turn hermaphroditic over time when exposed. This scientist was then fired and shunned by big pharma when he published his findings. The experiment was never recreated. I wonder why  It reminds me of taking several puzzles that were cut with the same dye and mixing them together.   I heard him on coast to coast am try to convince a gay guy they were poisoned from the water  the guys nuts.  Yep. I don t know anyone that is even remotely into q anon BS.  I actually have some of my mother s friends buying into 5g vaccine conspiracy nonsense.  The other day I saw someone post a conspiracy where they had the supposed  quot schematics quot  of the 5G vaccine chip.  Yeah I can see some aspects of whatever Q anon says getting out to normal people and them believing it. As far as full on q anon conspiracy theorists I think they are much more uncommon.  I sorta sympathize here. We  39 re so reliant on technology we  39 ve basically given up our freedom. I  39 m increasingly using a Tor browser  covering my webcam  and paying in cash  Yeah most of the stuff people are writing as tied to Q falls into the category of  random opinion  or  not left wing opinion.   Is Q another phrase that is going to lose meaning because of imprecise use  Me neither.  Same.  The Trumpian wing of the party needs to be expelled ASAP. A potato sack with an R on it could have beaten Hillary  would probably have beaten Biden  and absolutely would have had more Republican Senators elected in 2020.  Trump got people because he was the only politician talking about the things that actually mattered to them in decades. Most people  if you got them in a room by themselves  don  39 t  em really  em  give that much of a fuck whether other people have abortions or whether we have this foreign policy or that foreign policy. Most people want a good  stable job that keeps a roof over their head  food on the table  and allows them to save up enough to have fun every once in a while. Anything beyond that  most people  em really  em  don  39 t care all that much. Trump hit them on the issues that affect what they care about. He straight up told them  quot I am going to fight so you can have a good job  feed your family  and have some fun sometimes. quot  Did he deliver on that  Maybe. A lot of plants he visited claiming he was going to save all their jobs  Carrier in Indiana for one  ended up outsourcing and moving out of country anyway  but I  39 m sure someone could bring up some new plant that opened somewhere else and created jobs  so I don  39 t really know. Point is  he talked about what people cared about.   Remember when Chris Christie destroyed Marco Rubio  39 s chance at ever being President or anything other than just another politician  I do and it was funny.  I  39 m not a Chris Christie fan and I don  39 t care what your ideology is  but that was funny as fuck. Rubio just sat there and  em kept being a robot  em   spewing the same prepared speech  proving Christie  39 s point over and over again. It  39 s like he literally short circuited up on stage.  Let us dispel with this fiction that Marco Rubio doesn  39 t know what he  39 s doing  he knows exactly what he  39 s doing  Like remodeling his house on his government issued credit card   I mean  I don t disagree with him  the Q anon people are crazy  but I don t know anybody who actually a scribes to that. Obviously there are cute on people  but I don t know where or who they are  because I ve never met a conservative who actually is into the Q anon stuff  I ve only met one  and it was clear once you started talking to them that they bought into really weird conspiracies.  Unfortunately  many in my family are  quot Q anon people. quot  It  39 s very frustrating trying to talk with them  as you can imagine.  Rubio is right in this instance. But just to be clear  we need to be careful with this guy. He has about a Mitt Romney chance of winning in any general election.  I m a conservative. My family is mostly conservative. I have plenty of conservative friends  although way more liberal friends .   I don  39 t know one either but people did elect Marjorie Taylor Greene.  I still don t even know what qnon is  For some reason liberals get mad when you say this.  It s bizarre.  They started using the term and then expect everyone to know what it is  I don  39 t even know what Q is lol  Same here  I  39 ve tried to learn just to satisfy my curiosity  but a lot of the info is banned from the Internet.   From what I have heard  it was started by some guy named Q on 4chan who made random BS drops. Like he said Hillary  Obama  and the Deepstate would be arrested.   I  39 m sure the majority of regular every day conservatives already think these small extreme groups are morons. The things people are pissed off at are liberals double standards  the lefts take over of social media as a tool of propaganda. They can demonize conservatives at a constant and falsely make us out as monster via twisting things in the news  cherry picking  completing making things up or taking things out of context. Then they won  39 t report anything bad the left does and cover for them. There is a different set of rules regarding how a liberal vs conservative will be treated by social media and the news. Now they are openly removing conservative platforms while keeping liberal ones that call for violence and hate daily. Liberals can do horrible things with no consequences if conservatives even slightly break the rules the hammer comes down hard. You can see how bad things are if you just Google Gab or Parler  they on wiki come up listed as a place for the far right to gather  nazis  white supremacists and things like that. When if you actually participate in those social platforms you know even if that stuff is there they aren  39 t making up the majority and no one likes them most people there are regular conservatives. Yet those on the extreme left can spit out racism daily against those whom are white  they can call for violence to those they don  39 t like  they can praise the death of conservatives  they can praise the riots that occurred on their side  and all kinds of horrible and vile things. There are serious problems right now and things are not going to get better.  He  39 s right  but he is a bit of a tard too.  What does it matter  when it counts  you don  39 t stand for conservatives either. You drop to your knees like a cheap Detroit dime store Hooker whenever your job is on the line.
t3_kurc7f,Let us pause to remember when nearly 5000000 people signed a petition to overturn the election in 2016,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kurc7f/let_us_pause_to_remember_when_nearly_5000000/,Who cares about a petition though  I m still wondering why Russia helped Trump win in 2016 but not in 2020.   Maybe Russia did help trump but China helped Biden therefore proving that China is better than Russia  s  It seems very clear to me that China is aiding Biden because Trump imposed heavy trade wars with China.  The idea that a foreign nations would try to influence an election that could benefit them makes total sense. There are alot of false narratives and blanket statements going on. But if Russia sees Trump as someone who will lift trade constraints etc. then they should try to  quot infiltrate quot  our news social media  free news  Ads etc. To try and convince American people that Trump is the best option to vote. And likewise for China and honestly every country that has a stake in America. So each political party should be audited constantly for collaboration before being elected with foreign agents. This becomes hard for me personally because if you are already in a seat of politics like senate house governor president I feel like you should be communicating with foreign agents as applicable which causes the grey line to appear for what should be allowed. Those are my two cents to try to dispel single hate towards anyone  to know that it is done on both fronts and how I view it.  Too busy with COVID this year.  s   deleted   No  it can t be. You couldn t possibly be saying that  that... it was a hoax peddled by the Left    You really think they d do that  Get in front of the nation and lie like that     em laughs in garage door handle and 2am Subway sandwiches  em   I don  39 t even know what this means or how to mod it.  It was a reference to two obviously fake hate crime hoaxes the media peddled. The garage door handle was what Bubba Wallace referred to as a noose that was left for him. Subway at 2am was a reference to Jussie Smollett  39 s fake attack. The media spent a significant amount of time on these stories despite how suspicious they were.  Isn t the reason that we know they were fake because the media did their due diligence on seeking out answers clarification  though   All in the name of getting power  Not even for public safety  This cant be true   removed    removed   We should prioritize both RU and CN interference at the highest level  frankly.  Shame the Trump admin refused to do that out of fear of it delegitimizing their electoral win then.  It  39 s pretty clear that our own social media companies don  39 t need any foreign help to interfere with elections.   a href  https   www.intelligence.senate.gov sites default files documents Report Volume1.pdf  https   www.intelligence.senate.gov sites default files documents Report Volume1.pdf  a   Dont expect anyone to read official government reports that dissolve their alternate reality.   em gasp   em   Are we in conservative or conspiracy theories... lol  Can  39 t tell if people are being sarcastic  .  Or... and follow me on this one... they knew you absolute morons would attack democracy if he lost this election and their goal is a weakening of America. Moron labe  There s actually many possible reasons for that. If they thought trump would be a valuable ally in 2016 but by election season 2020 it turned out he didn t advance Putin s causes as much as was expected  which he certainly didn t   then the Russians would be less apt to interference and ad posting. Likewise is the idea that Putin is a fairly raging misogynist and that his hatred of Hillary specifically led to a lot of interference and her lack of presence turned him away from American politics. He may just have not seen a need or was expecting results favorable  He wanted Donald in office because of the specific chaotic effect it would have on american politics. Russia benefits from A  our withdrawal from worldwide soft power and B  America becoming seen as an unreliable ally.    yes the chaotic effect of a trump win  or the chaotic effect of interfering in general was also a key aim of Putin and Russia  Pretty much this. Remember than Putin not only wanted Trump to win  and helped him to achieve this  but he also wanted Sanders to win at the same time. The reason is obvious  because he knew those two candidates  being to the extremes of each other and the average citizen in general  would sew the most division.  Do you really think Russia  39 s goal was to get Trump elected  Their goal was to weaken the US by sowing division  among the domestic population and between America and her allies  and fomenting chaos. Trump was merely the opportunity that came along for them to do that.   removed   There should be  a href  https   www.politico.com news 2020 11 17 intel community foreign interference 2020 election 437094  an overview   a  from the intelligence community coming out soon detailing foreign interference in the 2020 election. In 2016  the CIA and FBI both confirmed foreign interference intended to help Trump.  Dominion machines gt Kremlin  Trump won fairly in 2016 and lost fairly in 2020. Not that hard to understand  Completely agree. Man I miss the days when the news was the news  and we didn  39 t have these avenues of misinformation ruining this country. Brainwashing to the nth degree.  Wel  it could be that Russia helped both times  but not enough in 2020.  There is actually evidence Russia helped  em both  em  sides in 2016.  I don  39 t believe their intent was to specifically make Trump win  they just wanted to sow division.  They just felt Trump was the underdog so they astroturfed for him more.  No  they DONT think  this is  a href   r conservative  r conservative  a    This. Signing a petition didn  39 t kill a cop  Because of  a href  https   www.washingtonpost.com national security us defends russian election interference 2020 10 21 533b508a 130a 11eb bc10 40b25382f1be story.html  rel  nofollow  this  a  perhaps.  Because it was never about them wanting trump in office  they wanted to hurt America.  Seeing everything unfold  they could not have hoped for a better outcome.  That would imply some sort of loyalty to Trump. While I m admittedly ignorant to the extent of Russian interference  it would be naive for someone to think that Putin s main goal was a Trump victory. Interference in the US elections was to discredit the voting process  disrupt the political landscape  destabilize the nation. If Putin thinks Bernie Sanders would accomplish that I m sure he d have no qualms about pushing him as hard as he can.  Russia has succeeded beyond their wildest expectations. Riotous mobs storming the capital fueled by misinformation. Putin is laughing his ass off at you.  You realize theyve had Russian trolls on basically every platform advocating for Trump  right  They  39 ve been doing that crap for 6 years. Social media has actively had to moderate it. They  39 ve literally slipped up and released locations on posts  from Russia. Most of them can  39 t even form complete sentences  but neither can a vast amount of Trump supporters  as it  39 s hard to tell the difference at times. Someone with broken English  posting from Russia about support for Trump and hate for the left... you don  39 t think  Hmm. People within the program have had interviews about it. Every counter intelligence division we have has confirmed it. They have massive govt sanctioned operations to disrupt foreign politics. Not just ours  but several other nations as well. They  39 ve hacked into nuclear sites. They are generally just causing chaos. And its working  obviously. A bunch of dumbfucks just stormed our own nation  39 s capitol. You don  39 t  for a second  think that they had a hand in encouraging people to go ape shit  If you don  39 t  you are incredibly naive. Using Trump and his oddly dedicated base is the best way to cause chaos here  all they need is to poke at people  39 s misplaced hate.  Sorry  the memory of the screams of agony from the police officer that was being crushed into a door by a mob shouting heave ho as they were breaking into the capital to threaten my elected representatives is too fresh. But wow  signing a petition that is way more extreme  A petition seems more reasonable than an attempted coup  That  39 s because it is  To be fair  they didn t riot after the results.  A lot of them wanted to  and many wished they had  but they didn t actually try to get their way with force.  And hillary did win the popular vote and they stood on that ground  it was more of a petition to the Electoral college to change which was never going to happen  than to say the election was a fraud and Biden didnt really win. There  39 s quite a difference in both.  Comparing last week to an online petition that you sign up for via email is quite a stretch.  On top of that  Trump lost the popular vote in 2016. So while people weren t technically in the right to contest the results as that s not how our system works  there was more precedent.  Trumpers grasping for straws.  I wish that mindset was not such a loud part of the conservative voice.  Trump and conservatism are completely synonymous in the eyes of 95   of people in the United States.  Conservative and republican are one in the same to 95   unfortunately  Also overturn wouldn  39 t have put Hilary in charge right  She was nobody at the time. It would be to hold another election.   Well yes  this Trumpy riot was insane. But leftists did riot after Trump won  just not at the capital   Imagine if Clinton had been recorded on the phone telling democrat state legislators to give her enough votes to win the state.  Furthermore  there was a lot more smoke with the 2016 election than this one. Multiple people were indicted as part of that investigation and it is pretty clear Russia did attempt to swing the election to trump.   quot At least 217 people were arrested in the melees  police said.  39   Think about this  they made the Vice President of the United States and the entirety of the United States Congress evacuate  hide  or barricade themselves  lest they be seen on LIVE TV hanging from the gallows erected outside the Capitol building   but less than half the number of people have been arrested than when black people got uppity  and the majority of them thus far have only been charged with misdemeanours.  Except this time we have the sitting president and dozens of congressmen pushing the fraud allegations and literal coup attempts happening at the capitol.  Interesting that like 5x as many people were arrested at that 2016 DC protest as compared to 1 6 21. I say interesting because they invaded the capitol building.  Yes  exactly. They didn  39 t storm the Capitol  em while the actual votes were being counted  em . That  39 s the difference between a protest and a coup.  Both   39 sides  39  are guilty of violence. It  39 s always going to be that way. I hate the way we are split like a bunch of football teams too.  Yup  I remember when a bunch of leftists beat a cop to death... oh  wait.  Violence is never justified . But as a human I can t help feeling more sympathy when there is an actual reason for the violence  systemic racism for example than when it s a pure fantasy    stolen votes   .  First of all its capitol  not capital. These riots were nowhere near as harmful as what was done at the capitol. Do not compare them.  But isn  39 t it the case that everyone who signed that petition in 2016 turned out to be right  The Constitution did need protecting from Trump  he did make an honest effort to install himself as dictator  everything in that petition is spot on.  No no. No one rioted after Trump won clearly not. Like there clearly wasn  39 t footage of people destroying shit and there clearly wasn  39 t t a petition to recount votes. Nope Trump is the only one to do this ever  Big difference is that those people didn t start because Hilary called  all true Patriots to DC   where she riled them up at a rally  called Stop the Steal   filled with disinformation to support her claim to have won the election. She didn t tell these folks that we have to bring the fight to them or that we needed trial by combat. She didn t send them to Congress to change Congress s mind.   beat police  one to death   With the american flag  while singing star spangled banner  It makes my blood boil.  Especially when you consider actual Nazis were there as well.  Thank God my grandfather  who fought in WWII  didn t have to see this.  When he was 95 he told me the only thing he wished was that he could just see how things progressed  he had such a positive view of America at the time.  He would have been 100 and seeing this would have been so sad.  Literal nazis killing cops in DC for the President.  Fuck.  There s a clear difference between a real conservative  and a populist like Trump in my mind.  Then the GOP needs to grow some balls and finally decry what has happened en masse and do something about it. Even after an attempted coup and prominent GOP officials had their lives threatened  they are still more worried about losing the Trump voters than doing the right thing. He  39 s a liability to the party and the country. Trump  39 s voters are loyal to Trump MAGA movement  not the GOP and they need to wake up and realize that. The GOP was a tool Trump needed to be elected  nothing more. If Trump does want to run again in 2024 the GOP now has to decide if they let him run their party again  or if he runs as an independent and guarantees a democratic win as the vote is split. Remove him from office and impeach to ensure he never runs again. Inaction shows that this behavior was acceptable  and the next time  under Trump or his successor  they might be a lot better organized.  If the GOP is any indication  with their attempts to still protect Trump nearly a week after his attempted coup  there is no discernible or appreciable difference.  I recently read  I don  39 t remember where  something like  quot In a healthy democracy  violence is always out of bounds because any reasonable reform can be achieved at the ballot box. quot   Oh my God so much  sup  sup    sup   sup  this.  Yeah  lets compare the 99.99  peaceful 2017 Women  39 s March  with no deaths  to last week  39 s  quot HANG MIKE PENCE quot  chants  a dead cop  4 dead supporters  and an attempt to take senators hostage.  Yeah the difference is hillary  who i do not like  didnt start a tirade of unsubstantiated claims and conspiracy theories for months to provoke the rioters  also there  39 s a huge difference between a petition and storming the capitol  i suppose you think if it was done before then its ok for trump to repeat it now because others done it 4 years ago or 8 years ago or even 100 years ago.  A civilian signing a petition is not the same thing as a president going to court  keep up.  And then those 5 million people went and stormed the US Capitol building when they didn  39 t get their way... oh wait  But according to all the memes  only leftists riot and protest when they don t get their way.  Didn t you know every liberal city in America is in ruins because of antifa    Waiting for you to be silenced because you re not a flared user on their  free speech  forum  This subreddit is pretty open about not being unbiased  Didn t fit the narrative at the time.  Online petitions don  39 t really mean shit. They  39 re like wishes on shooting stars.  People not wanting trump in office  Sounds exactly like the narrative the last 4 years  Or it wasn  39 t pushed as the saving grace because she had already conceded the election  and didn  39 t go around trying to convince everyone that she won by a landslide  And then everyone involved was banned from all of the internet and humanity  I remember it so well.  Let us pause for 3 seconds and list the names of elected officials that supported the overturning of the 2016 election result  Yes because signing a petition is the same as literally storming the capital  beating someone to death  and bring in pipe bombs and zip ties to execute politicians  Well  let  39 s be real  Back then there wasn  39 t a coup involved that killed police officers  the losing party wasn  39 t quoting Hitler and intelligence agencys found evidence for russian tampering.  2016   a couple million angry people on the internet signed a petition. Clinton conceded immediately after the election.   Don t forget to add to 2016  knit pink hats and peacefully marched in support of women s rights  And then they stormed the capitol building  killed a cop  threatened senators and the Vice President  and five died in the process ... oh wait.  Yes  let us pause and remember how 5 000 000 patriotic citizens used their first amendment rights to sign a petition in peaceful protest and compare that to today when sore losers staged a violent coup in a failed attempt to destroy our democracy. Thank you for pointing out how dissimilar these events are.  In hind sight we see what they were concerned about. Still  Trump won in 2016 and took office as he should. What he did with it lead to his defeat in 2020. Now we move on.  Did any of them break into a federal building and try to kill members of Congress   And literally beat a cop to death  Let us pause and remember when participants at a republican rally beat a cop to death.   a href  https   pbs.twimg.com media ErWiHhuW4AAIXjR format jpg amp name medium  https   pbs.twimg.com media ErWiHhuW4AAIXjR format jpg amp name medium  a     They didn  39 t raid the fucking Capitol.  If we keep pausing  the dems will keep winning. Time for the GOP to wake up and realize that trump destroyed our party. Not the dems  liberals  BLM  no  trump destroyed it  Back in 2016 I fell for the election promises he made. I thought he  39 d bring about a stronger America.  I was completely duped by a madman  you guys give me faith in humanity  so glad there are still sane conservative s about.  I d rather admit I m wrong than try to make excuses.  It s a good thing this isn t  flaired  only  else you d never see rational discourse.  With a lot of help from other Republicans  not just the elected representatives who went along with his agenda  refused to condemn even his worst actions  but also the millions of rank and file Republicans who voted for him  the people who knew that he was a perennial liar  a serial adulterer  utterly unprepared for the presidency and with no interest in becoming prepared  who  39 d cheated his way out of serving in the military  and bragged about grabbing women by the genitals... and didn  39 t think any of that was a deal breaker.  The first half is not a problem with republicans  it s a problem with a party system which allows the president to control where campaign money goes. They went along with his agenda in order to continue their career. It s messed up and needs to be changed. Second half I have no rebuttal for  Because 5 million signatures is exactly the same as invading a federal building  vandalizing  stealing and disrupting legal federal operations.    quot But that was totally different   Someone tampered with the results   I know there  39 s proof because I read it on reddit  quot   The Russia thing was about election  em interference  em   not election fraud. Russia spread disinformation on social media. It did not tamper with ballots.  Did you read the link   What s wrong with signing a petition and how does it relate to causing multiple deaths and breaking into a secure federal building trying to hang Mike Pence   No one claimed there was tampering.  The fact that he s dangerous on top of losing the popular vote and still winning the electoral college was the focus.  Almost self aware.  Did they storm the capitol and murder a cop   Because he lost the popular vote... by a lot....  5 000 000 people saw this coming  yeah i think there s a big difference between singing a petition and charging the capitol while chanting things like  hang mike pence    Member when protestors tried to breach the White House back in May  allegedly forcing Secret Service to take Trump to the bunker  and it was celebrated   They didn  39 t try to breach the Whitehouse. They were standing outside protesting. Also they are doing renovations on the original gate so there  39 s another fence that  39 s like 200  ft from the original gate and it stands like 12ft tall. You can barely even see the Whitehouse from behind it. No one was climbing or even violently shaking the fence either. What they actually did was post their protest signs to it and keep it moving.    quot The scene on Friday night  described by a person with firsthand knowledge  kicked off an uneasy weekend at the White House as demonstrations spread after the brutal death of a black man in police custody under a white officer s knee. While in the end officials said they were never really in danger  Mr. Trump and his family have been rattled by protests near the Executive Mansion that turned violent for a third night on Sunday. quot   Was that before or after they laid seige to the Federal Court house for months  So hard to remember sometimes...  Was that before or after they claimed US soil as sovereign territory named CHAZ   Since it is not reported more than polite necessary people don t remember. It is all about what makes the news  how much it is reported and with how high energy it is reported. Trump in a bunker  I have slight remembering of that. Can t tell what happened or why.  You  39 re comparing BLM protestors NEAR the whitehouse to protestors marching straight from the presidents rally  to capitol hill and immediately storming the place...  BLM protestors didn  39 t even try to enter the white house  what are you talking about  There is no evidence they attempted to breach the white house.  Also  subject matter is important.  but did they open the door for them in order to take a shit in the middle of the White House   Do you have a good source for this  That  39 s insane    a href  https   www.nytimes.com 2020 05 31 us politics trump protests george floyd.html  NYT  As Protests and Violence Spill Over  Trump Shrinks Back  a   Did protesters actually enter the white house  Were any armed   No and no  lol. Protesting near the White House and other federal buildings is 100  legal and a normal thing to do. Bringing weapons  bombs  and zip ties while actually breaching a federal building chanting  Hang Mike Pence  is 100  NOT legal and NOT normal.  Yeah  it was a popular thing to tease Trump on social media for  hiding  for a day after he made his lackluster TV appearance after the George Floyd riots started. It wasn t good optics.   I  39 m confused  that said the protestors gathered near the White House  not that they breached it and attempted to lynch Trump   Conservatives are liars. Period. No one tried to storm the whitehouse over the summer.  I actually don  39 t remember this. What was the situation   Oh my God  Not A PETITION  Heeeellllp   and Madonna and friends thought a lot about blowing up the White House.  This is not even CLOSE to comparable.   the republican party is dead they used to be reasonable people  now you have people posting garbage like this to defend what went on last week.  The right can sign any petitions they want  too  and I  39 m sure some have already been made. Liberals didn  39 t raid the capitol and kill a cop when we were upset  they protested and signed petitions like true patriots. They didn  39 t attack fellow Americans like traitors and call for the hanging of congressmen that disagree with their point of view.  Posts like these are why this subreddit has a bad name. Who cares if someone signed a petition  That is not a federal crime  that is freedom of speech. That is literally what this country is about.   Change.org doesn t do anything except for pedal your information to advertisers.  You are equating meaningless online petitions with an armed invasion of the seat of American democracy.  And no homegrown terrorist uprisings that lead to an assault on the nation s Capitol.  .............. did they storm the fucking government  force their way in  smear shit on the walls  beat a cop to death  and then get started on plan  2   And then those 5 million stormed the capital and attempted a coup...  Signing a petition  lt  storming the capitol  No one stormed the Capitol that time though.  At least they only signed a petition and didn t storm the capital and kill a cop...  Let  39 s also remember when none of them  at the urging of Obama  stormed the Capitol  threw racial slurs at Capitol Police  killed one  and smeared feces on the wall. Get the fuck out of here with your false equivocation.  If it wasn  39 t for the double standard they would have no standard. It helps when you have propaganda on your side.  Do you remember how many red states signed secession petitions online when Obama won re election in 2012  History doesn t end four years ago.   a href  https   en.wikipedia.org wiki 2012 U.S. state secession petitions  https   en.wikipedia.org wiki 2012 U.S. state secession petitions  a   Probably more than 4 years  and the last 2 or 3 weeks took it to a new level.  Based on the headline alone  I  39 m not really sure this holds a candle to  you know  the thousands storming the capitol to force an overturning via  insert individual insurrectionist  39 s plan here   Did any of those petition signers  a href  https   pbs.twimg.com media ErWiHhuW4AAIXjR format jpg amp name medium  rel  nofollow  do shit like this   a   Yes  because signing a petition and storming the Capitol to stage a coup are the same thing. smh  Because trump lost the popular vote in 2016 that s why it was petitioned to be overturned. Actual facts. He lost the popular vote again  his followers want it overturned anyway  but instead of having facts they have baseless conspiracy theories  and instead of petitioning they organize a terrorist attack on innocent people.  A petition is a little different than a terrorist attack on the nation  39 s capital. Trying to justify an attack like that is a pretty bad look.  But  like  did they threaten to hang Mike Pence and murder members of Congress   Another online petition is literally the least threatening thing anyone could do to another person lol.  Theres no way to overturn Americas election   russia interfered by troll farms and bots in a misinformation campaign.  See FBI report  Lmao it was a petition not a coup attempt.  Sure  people have the right to protest election results. Actually  to protest any government policies they oppose. At the same time anyone who burns shops or destroys public property should be prosecuted. Since Trump won  there have been many women s marches opposing his administration.  As long as they are peaceful  I have no problems with them.  Anybody die   But they didn t storm the Capitol lmao  No one thought the election was fraudulent when that petition was signed. They were tired of winning the popular vote but losing the office thanks to the antiquated electoral college. There s a HUGE difference here.  It  39 s a little embarrassing to see fellow conservatives who claim to be patriots but don  39 t understand how America works. Petitions are okay. Attacking the capitol is not okay. I feel like you don  39 t need a law degree to understand that much.  Last i checked their wasn  39 t any insurrection with those  True but no one attacked a federal building and attempted to take hostages.  remember when they stormed the capital also   geez. what a way to bring down the other side after the events of last week.  We should also pause to note that Hillary Clinton didn  39 t take part in that petition  or allege fraud.  Signed a petition  not stormed the Capitol  Remember how RADICAL LEFT ANTIFA stormed the capitol in 2016   So the population of LA signed a petition...  Did they storm the Capitol and commit treason  I am amazed so many of you want to die on this hill.  Ah yes  I remember the time Hillary supporters stormed the Capitol building with tactical weapons and flex cuffs. This is clearly the same thing.   Anyone care to explain how signing a petition and violently storming the capitol and stopping the electoral count which caused 5 deaths and a multitude of injuries are even remotely in the same universe   Yes a  a href  https   change.org  change.org  a  petition is very much the same as storming the capital of the united states  great analogy conservatives.  At least the left didn  39 t kill at least 5 people over it.  this post is getting brigaded. kudos to the mods for trying to open things up again  Oh crap a non flaired post  am I in the right sub   Incredible. What is wrong with you  80  of the comments and posts deflection and relativization.  America only spiraling deeper and deeper into hate.   Yeah all the Russia talk following 2016 election was embarrassing to say the least  but signing a petition is abit different to breaching the fucking seat of government lol  At least they didn t storm the capital  Im surprised this isnt on flaired users only already. All the other top posts are lol.
t3_kv8yj8,Thats a hell of a pivot Andrew Cuomos sudden change of heart on COVID19 shutdowns has people clamoring for an explanation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv8yj8/thats_a_hell_of_a_pivot_andrew_cuomos_sudden/,When will people wake up and see what a snake this man is   I saw on one of the weed subreddits he s trying to legalize in NY. Which would make sense if he s trying to cover all this shit up to make it look like he s a good guy. Just mention thinking about legalization and the potheads  not all but most  lose their shit and forget what the person behind it has done in the past.  Interestingly I smoke cbd flower for sleep pain and anxiety. Know who one of the only people in Congress actually pushing legislation to make cbd and hemp easier to sell to people and loosen restrictions  It  39 s a Democrat right           Not just this man but the whole party  Now that Braindead Biden and Kommie Kamala are about to take the helm  it  39 s alright for Cuomo to stop stabbing New York  39 s economy in the nuts.  He  39 s just pivoting to usher in a grand new era.   deleted   Ding ding ding   People have been calling this since day one. That as soon as Trump was out  the BLM and Covid  19 inflammatory reporting would stop. BLM has all but ceased to even be a talking point for the most part and Covid 19 will be next. I am sure Biden will try to take credit for his impeccable response time lol  piggybacking off Trumps hard work in no time flat.  The explanation is obvious   he no longer needs the hostages.  He  39 s a PoS.

Of course  He didn  39 t miss one single paycheck and doesn  39 t have to follow his own rules.  What get  39 s me is how outright brazen these people are being.  See you don  39 t have to. Morons like my father lap up whatever shit the MSM puts out and believes it.  9 months too late bro   deleted   New York will take nearly a decade to recover from last year. Longer under Biden  39 s bullshit economic plans.  New York is Gotham again.  Its so obvious  what a hypocrite.  This fucking guy. He must want to decide who dies and who gets the ventilator or he wants kill Grandma.  This is a man who is willing to kill in order to keep a political opponent from scoring any political points.  Dude would be saying the opposite if trump got another term  Asshole is throwing away vaccines because he can  39 t dictate who gets the vaccine first.  Maybe he shouldn  39 t have shut down New York  39 s economy in the first place. Hypocrite.  We should demand everything stay closed now.  I seem to recall someone mentioning this...

Hey  people got used to lockdowns for covid. Now lockdowns will be the standard response to everything else.  at least this time it will be for a good reason.  Then for gun violence  then for climate change then for  em insert buzzword here  em   But I thought protests were cool. Even more important than COVID restrictions   And... This IS the end of the 2nd amendment...  They destroying ammendments  in order....  So you act as there publicist and leak it to the news so more people know to turn up      Where the hell are they getting this from   They are going to make it happen on the nightly news. Wagging the dog.  And you wonder why so many people are pissed off.   quot A group quot    It is deliberately vague  just like tech companies  39  terms of service.  It s probably Antifa  amp  BLM organizing...you know...those  ideas  that don t exist as a physical organization  gee who saw that coming haha  Attacking the capital would be the stupidest thing to do.

This is happening all over to a lot of people. People are getting doxed for being at the rally. Even if they didn t go in the capitol  There are chicks on Instagram who are calling for their followers to doxx anyone they can who has not adequately condemned the capitol riots who is an Instagram influencer. This person is responsible for posting at least one person s full name and address  and is encouraging her followers to do more  Yep it won t be long until the box cars come because we aren t fit to live in their world  Right  How are they supposed to work with whoever this was after this  I mean  talk about a hostile workplace environment  if this were the private sector  you would have an HR complaint  Because they think they are going to bomb a plane or commandeer it and fly it into a building   Remember when people objected to a  quot no fly list quot  because it has no due process and will be abused    It s no wonder so many Republicans were against it and warning others not to stand up for their Constituents.

t3_kvd2ur,Biden Says Minority and WomenOwned Small Businesses Priority,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvd2ur/biden_says_minority_and_womenowned_small/,I wonder if a Black woman owned a gun shop if she  39 d be eligible for federal aid.  Honestly a fair question my friend.   White  is a minority in California.  Does that mean they get preferential treatment   Im confused.  I thought we couldn  39 t say  quot women quot  anymore. is this only for vagina holding small business owners   Are   39 vagina holding  39  and   39 pussy grabbing   39  the same thing  Asking for a friend...  Not everyone with a vagina is a woman and not all women have vaginas. You can say woman in this case because it means just women.  I ll just call women  things  then. Since there s no proper term  we ll just resort back to the old days of objectifying women. Wtf   yes  biological women are once again to be reduced to a sex organ.  As a biological woman I find this hilarious  thank you. The new normal is simply insanity.  Amen   I totally forgot to add the fact I was interpreting this in leftist. I don  39 t personally believe it.  I think it s  em Homo sapiens  em  containing 2 X chromosomes on the 23rd pair.  So instead of all American small business getting help only minorities and women owned businesses are going to get help . I thought he said that he will bring us all together .  That was never the message  to be sure.  To be honest  he only said it out of one side of his mouth.  tldr  Biden says   quot suck it whitey boys  you  39 re on your own. Now let  39 s have some fuckin  39  unity  quot   The left is just working harder and harder to destabilize the US.  Their lockdowns have killed a lot of businesses and jobs.  Leaving many people with little to lose.  Now saying that the men that have lost everything aren  39 t worth helping is just adding fuel to the fire.  How is this not a civil rights violation   It is. As soon as he is in office and starts it lawsuits will be filed.  doesn  39 t matter because the Supreme court will go along with all of the nonsense.  No they wont.  Sure they won  39 t  I dont think they would  we have the majority but most of the justices didn  39 t want to be the one to   39 disenfranchise  39  millions of voters. But with shit like this  i dont see them doing it.  We won  39 t have the majority after they pack the courts.  If they do it will start a war. I genuinely dont think they would attempt that.  Everything they have been doing has had the effect of dividing the people and inflaming tension. At this point I  39 m having a hard time finding any explanation besides it being intentional. They are trying to start a war.  I m Asian American  amp  I don t need his identity politics crap.  Go shove it  buddy.  I self identify as a minority female.  Can t we all just identify as Native American like Pocahontas Warren did   Solves all the issues right   Guess I m Trans now    s   Unity    Only applies to leftists and their chosen oppressed groups.  How about ALL small businesses dipstick  A family member  39 s small business is struggling as is and he really needs a boost. So what if he is white  black or poka dot  ALL small business should be helped.  Sounds quite sexist  racist  and discriminatory.  A priority for sniffing.  Kamala already running the show.  Does he not think that white business owners also hire minority workers.  Hey look our new  president   is good at discrimination. Shocked.   quot You know what I love in my america  discrimination on the basis of race and gender quot    Biden and the Democratic party.  This is already the case. I bid public works construction projects  99  of public works has set asides for both already. As a veteran owned business I have 3  set asides.  Part of the Great Reset   But the businesses owned by white men  and their employees  can continue to suffer.  What is really sad is that children of all races are being neglected and going hungry. But hey  politics Trump hungry kids. But go for it Uncle Joe. Go for it Nancy.
t3_kv45t6,Boycott Big Tech The Best Way for Conservatives to Fight Back,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv45t6/boycott_big_tech_the_best_way_for_conservatives/,I am normally against boycotting businesses just because their owners officers have different views than mine.  As long as they are minding their own business  I have no issue with them.  Already done. In the past two months I ve deleted Facebook  cancelled my prime subscription and all my prime video channels  Apple Music  Netflix for working on a Trump smear piece with the Obama s.  None of my money is going to any of these companies until they change course.  Good  Same here  deleted all those apps and subscriptions  I canceled my Prime today.  Been a member since I can remember.  No more.  I  39 m already a good part of the way there. I  39 m staying on FB for networking reasons staying connected with friends and family  not likely gonna do anything politically there .  That  39 s good  Glad to hear how unconnected you are to Big Tech. And yeah  Google is probably the most difficult to escape from. My proposed solution  for now  is to buy phones from Samsung. I know they use the Android operating system  but at least Samsung is otherwise unconnected to Google and not really and SJW minded company. That  39 s not perfect  of course  but I think it  39 s the best we can do for now.  I currently have a OnePlus device  and I  39 m going to research more earnestly into Rooting processes. Gotta dump that Google bloatware...  I haven  39 t heard of OnePlus  do they completely avoid Google software  If so  they might be an excellent alternative  I  39 ve had a OnePlus 3 since launch. I would like to replace it but the damn thing won  39 t break. They are great phones but it  39 s a Chinese based company and they use Android.  Google Android is far worse than Apple.  Counterpoint  Android allows for side loading apps that have been removed from the Google Play store  while Apple does not. This is especially important in the wake of the Parler debacle.  You can still do that with iPhones  but it takes more effort and it is riskier business   a href  https   www.wired.com story install apps outside app store sideload   rel  nofollow  https   www.wired.com story install apps outside app store sideload   a   Does it involve jailbreak ing it  That  39 ll void the warranty...  It does.  Yes  it  39 s much riskier and harder to do than with Android.  Stop directing your 401k into these large cap funds that are tech stock heavy.  Absolutely. One of the easiest ways to do that is with equal weighted etfs rather than the traditional ones that are heavily weighted towards the FAANG stocks. Not perfect  but easy to implement and quite effective IMO.  Most of these boomers jumping shop to Parler probably dont even know they are up to 36  invested in social media.  Yup. That issue needs to be brought more to light. I think it will be as more articles are written on this topic  Most of these old timers jumping ship to Parler probably dont even know they are up to 36  invested in social media.  Leaving these social network platforms is not enough   Their product is advertising and as long as advertisers believe they help get customers they are not going to leave.  We need to poison their product.  If 75 000 000 trump supporters wrote letters to advertisers on twitter saying we won  39 t buy their products as long as they advertise on twitter   it could be gone in a few weeks.  Yeah why do people keep trying to reason with them. Spend 10 minutes scrolling through related posts on this sub and you will quickly discover just how bad the double standards are. They have created a game where either you say the things they want you to say or get blacklisted.  we need our own telecoms   oem hardware software   delivery services   social ect.  Yeah so alternatively  if we mass migrate to certain platforms money will talk. At the end of the day  these investors don t give a shit about the SJW stuff. If they see us fleeing  the money will follow.   I agree that that may force the big players to bend the knee however this is bigger than that.   These companies and their employees  by a large margin  are funding our opposition.  These companies need to be bled dry.   Our money needs to go to companies that support America and our way of life.  This is a zero sum game we are playing now and it needs to be acknowledged and become front and center to any strategy going forward.  I think more and more conservatives are starting to recognize that. The next few months should see Twitter and others plummet in value as about half the country flees them for alternatives. Maybe that s overly optimistic  but it could happen if current trends hold  We need solid red state alternatives and infrastructure.  We need this divorce to hurt the left more than it hurts us.  Agreed. I think much of that infrastructure exists  but is still in relative infancy. Hopefully it will develop more as conservatives flee traditional online infrastructure like Google and Facebook  Hey I sent you a DM when you get a chance  Just did    a href   r degoogle  rel  nofollow  r degoogle  a   Is this a wise idea  Would this not cause Big Tech to double down on their policies  since in the hypothetical situation conservatives would no longer be part of their audience   That might happen. In fact  you  39 re probably right that it will. However  if we  39 re uninvolved because we use different services products  then how would that affect us at any real level   Look at what happened to Parler and any other non mainstream social media  they are all classified by mainstream media as a place for the ists and phobes to gather. The platforms are dropped by their hosting service  payment processors  and search indexes. They are also infiltrated by bad actors who post material that would cause the sites to be targeted by the government. Another problem that the alternative sites have is that they are restricted to a narrow audience which means it will not reach mainstream status and credibility.   Yes those are problems that need to be addressed. However  I think they will be as more people switch to them. That might take time but will  I think  ultimately happen. Just look at where we are now  leagues ahead of where we were a few years ago  I just think that the actions that conservatives are taking is reminiscent of their retreat from the Entertainment industry and academia  and in doing so will imitate the loss of power and influence that retreat caused. Also there are so many alternatives that the base will likely scatter and not have enough traffic for the alternatives to live. Which will cause a win for the mainstream sites.  That  39 s a fair point. I think some  however  might prove to be effective substitutes that many conservatives use. Parler and Rumble  specifically  have the potential to be widely adopted

This is discrimination and that cannot be argued  And I expect the Supreme Court to not opine   quot You should have sued before it was law  No Standing   quot   The jury box has been compromised  Dismissed for whatever reason they can pull out of their ass before even calling jurors.  That  39 s why I cringed everytime someone brought up what a genius and amazing person ACB was. I highly doubt any of Trumps SC picks will join the hard fight for justice. Kavanah is a beaten dog  ACB has to think of her 9 children  39 s safety and future careers and Gorsuch will just play the libertarian card as part of the minority vote if he doesn  39 t join the majority and reject it outright to save his reputation.  Discrimination is ok when they do it.    quot Who built the cages  quot   Putting kids   Id guess petting kids    deleted   I m sorry having to ask  but I suspect what you said wasn t caught by voice to text. I m kinda confused what you mean  So using race and sex to decide to help people or not........hmmmm there is a word for that and  unity  is not it.  The word is  quot Democrat quot   Demented idiot. I hope SCOTUS rules on that one.   quot Sorry  you don  39 t have standing... quot   A democratic explaining why a minoritys need help always puts a smile on my face.  It s ridiculously sad that they cannot see past the victimization narrative.  Okay well I  39 m going to self identify as whatever gets me the most money in the fastest time. Apparently self identifying is just as good as actual science  so you can  39 t question me.  Your social media accounts  bank accounts and browser history say otherwise. Big brother knowns you aren  39 t a true believer  be prepared to be audited and thrown in prison for your crimes.  We  39 re about to see what real systemic racism looks like.  It s approved by those in power  and those who speak up are going to be dogged till they are fired as we are seeing happening right now.   It  39 s gonna be a weird four years.  Biggest understatement of 2021  It took a lot of effort to understate that.  He learned so much from Robert Byrd.  The great reset. Much like the redistribution of wealth and property in Zimbabwe  it ensures an economic collapse that will keep Biden  39 s party in power for a long time. Expect to see some Blue States take it a step further and prioritize vaccine  then healthcare along those lines over need.  But equal protection clause   Some races are more equal than others comrade.  Racist and gender phobic.  From now on it is  quot illegal quot  to post this ugly face because it makes people sick and may pose mental damage.
t3_kuzchp,Twitters Jack Dorsey Mocks Parler Purge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuzchp/twitters_jack_dorsey_mocks_parler_purge/,Biden  39 s election is so legitimate that you have to persecute anyone saying otherwise.  They re following the greats such as Stalin  Mussolini   Xi Jinping and their favourite of all Adolf hitler.  It s so legitimate that they censor all evidence of fraud because we know that fraud didn t happen anyways  The real story  outside of Trump  is that a business was able to have its competitor taken offline and then openly mocked its competitor after the fact. Kind of like how CNN is calling for Fox News to be taken down. Companies that are in Biden  39 s back pocket are able to say  quot take down our competitor  make us the only game in town quot  and it gets done. They don  39 t even need to hide it.  This. Is the point ive been trying to tell people. They  39 re framing it as terrorism or w.e but what it  39 s really about is competition and power. Gab.com is going to crush them  its a million times better.  I made sure to grab an account over there the other day. I don  39 t know what  39 s in store for the next few weeks but I wanted to make sure I stayed in the loop about where to go next or what everyone has been saying  with all of our favorite conservative voices being taken offline.  Ive been making repetitive posts about gab. Trying to make sure everyone sees it and keep people in the loop. Its actually really good too.  Jack Dorsey has something seriously wrong with him. Special kinda fucked in the head.  Read  quot Hatching Twitter quot . He  39 s a piece of shit who basically stole the company.  Oh. Wow. Heading there now  Honestly he was probably a loser in high school and this is all his ego getting back at his childhood bullies.  This isn  39 t just about Trump anymore  this is straight up censorship...  No collusion to see here at all  absolitely none.  What they don t see is that when the  conservative  media is gone they will be left to only eat each other until one is left standing.  This won t end with republican censorship.  Thus right here. They ve tasted blood and it will never end.  The fact that he s so god dammed smug and obvious about his support for censorship is appalling.  Im mocking their stock price  Gab.com is dope  Little slow cuz they  39 re scaling up with the rush of traffic but if ur willing to wait for pages to load you can sign up. I got in and its sweet. Very nice UI  better than parler. Sell off big tech stock of u got it  vote with your wallet friends.  All the leftists on any popular subreddit will gaslight you by saying this is a free market response  not suppression of free speech. Welcome to the  strong spin zone  strong   baby   Filthy sellout.  Literally filthy. You can smell and taste the odor from his rasputin beard in photos.  Garbage people do garbage things.  There is a place in hell for this garbage human.  That will be a burden he must cross one day of which I m sure he will Mock the whole way leading up to it.  I hope he can repent before it s too late for himself.  Alex Jones was the beginning  regardless of what you think of the man  he should ve NEVER been blacklisted from the Internet  and now POTUS Trump is their latest trophy. It won t stop with Trump either. At this point  anyone slightly right of Stalin can will be Thanos snapped from the Internet for any reason thought they don t like. I honestly thought I would never see this kind of stuff in real life.  C  39 mon guys  they  39 re just censoring us because we censored them first when President Trump won in 2016 and they denied it...oh wait.  Technofascism is here.  Ultimately this can be a good thing. Amazon has such a monopoly on hosting and other internet services and they just created a huge market for a competitor over night.  All non left leaning news outlets should take note and invest in making a competitor.  Gab.com is sweet. Sluggish right now cuz theyre scaling up but i was patient and got in  def worth it. The UI is great   Would love to see that tweet used as evidence one day  The ultimate problem is that conservatives play by the rules and liberals make the rules.  Jack Dorsey is bin Laden  No where near as smart.  And bin laden at least had the balls to call out his enemy from around the world while hiding in a cave.  Dorsey gave no notice before he started nuking accounts.  This just proves it has nothing to do with moderating content on his platform. It  39 s about censoring political speech he disagrees with.  Patriots are rolling over in their graves. All jokes aside  I think we will all be in gulags by the years end. They are trying to literally erase us  and don t even try to hide it anymore. Incredible.   Fck Jack   Remember Whitey Bolger    Jack dorsey looks and acts like the mandarin off of Ironman.  Whenever he gets asked a really tough question on why Twitter did   39 xyz  39  its like he  39 s looking off camera for his handlers to tell him why and instead he gets hung out to dry.  And the charade continues.  A true story about Fortune Cookies  wait that s not right  I don t think it was ever about Trump  it was about attacking and silencing us. Trump was just a good catalyst to use.  First they came for the      From now on it is  quot illegal quot  to post this ugly face because it makes people sick and may pose mental damage.  Keep on shorting the Twitter stock. They are extremely vulnerable.

WAIT NO THINKING IS BAD DON  39 T DO THAT GUYS  IF YOU THINK RATIONAL YOU  39 D BE A CONSERVATIVE AND THEY ARE NAZIS  I used to lean libertarian but watching what has happened this week with the tech companies has moved me full conservative.  These companies need to be treated as publishers at this point.  This hands off approach is actually dangerous for the country and all the libertarian come backs for addressing it are not realistic.  Can Biden pardon a company  Seems like that would be a get out of jail for all the collusion and anti trust they are doing right now. I assume biden would be fine with it after all Zuck already donated lots for the georgia run off and Hunter can take the money in necessary to get the pardon   Unfortunately  all of the big five tech companies are legally corporations. A corporation is legally defined as a person for most purposes.  Trump wanted to drain the swamp. Biden is the swamp.

It will never end  deaths  rapes  murders  thousands of injuries  millions of dollars of damages  people losing their livelihoods  businesses...all ignored or gaslighted by leftists and the media.  The BLM Antifa riots were also the largest non natural disaster payout in history at 2 billion and counting. of course many businesses were not covered for rioting or had no insurance.

Money talks.  We  39 ll see  it could kick back by end of week. People have short memories  This is what I  39 m watching for. Not only people buying into the stocks but also realizing how convenient Twitter  amp  Facebook are and not willing to make the sacrifice. Hope I  39 m wrong.  If Trump be gone  then Twitter shall also be gone.  Interesting take could be a lawsuit by shareholders that they violated their fiduciary responsibility.    Because Twitter was just a machine for people to send harassing replies to the President  amp  bitch about his every move. It was over 99  Trump related content  amp  less than 1  everything else. There  39 s nothing to talk about if they can  39 t talk about him.  I thought this was a Babylon bee and I was thinking  how tf does twitter share a sink   The thing is that this won t stop them  they don t care. They care more about their religious duty to destroy conservatives than they care about money  which they have enough of.

Yet none of these threats occured in 2016.  Has Rogan even covered the riots   He caved to Spotify  It  39 s kind of what I thought. Over the summer he seemed to cover the BLM stuff a lot  it was just strange to basically hear nothing about what was going on in DC. I guess  100MM is too sweet. Can  39 t say I blame him.  What in the communist fuck is going on with our country   They cheated and they won  so now they can do whatever they want with no fear of ever losing again  After Parler  media platforms are terrified of being removed completely. This is hell on earth... but  Have faith...we cannot give up.  Pravda is the only state approved media outlet. All others have to be destroyed.  Ben Shapiro is the largest conservative podcast in the nation  he should tell Cumulus to suck it  The lengths they are going to in order to shut people up and not do a 10 day audit is very illustrative.    Cracking down on anyone who dares questions results make me think they are terrified of what we might find if we actually investigated properly.  For years  myself and other pundits have questioned if we live in two Americas. What we  39 re witnessing now is the physical manifestation of that terrible notion. An entire population where one side does not talk to the other    a house divided which cannot stand.  The fix. Wonder how long this has been planned   Those guys are big enough to form their own media company. I wonder how  quot Cumulus Media quot  would fair without them   If they do  move on over to BlazeTV  Disputing elections was all hip in 2016....and Cumulus Media didn  39 t so squat.  The only reason to fire them for speaking of election fraud is because they know the fraud is real.  It  39 s happening.

Totally not sus at all. No explanation  no dissents  but just a  quot nah  we  39 re just gonna ignore this quot   They didn  39 t reject the case they rejected the motion to hear it before inauguration. This means they can say yes it was true but it  39 s too late now. They can issue rules for going forward.  Yes  but what could be done about the election after Biden  39 s innaugration  Will they come back and say   quot Well  he really shouldn  39 t have been given the Presidency  so let  39 s take it away from him and put Donald Trump into the office. quot   They can rule about things going forward. Which is what they rather do. After they rejected the other case from texas its what I expected. It  39 s honestly better than nothing. I would take being vindicated that it was fraud and I  39 m not crazy. We are left with hope 22 will be able to change things.  If they ignored literal constitutional laws in this election  what  39 s stopping them from just ignoring a judges rulings   It  39 s the green light for the Dem  39 s to cheat in every election.
t3_kvgxvd,PayPal Blocks Group That Helped Trump Supporters Travel to D.C.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvgxvd/paypal_blocks_group_that_helped_trump_supporters/,This is where it starts getting dangerous. You can t access money or get paid if you fall foul of mob.  When you say  dangerous  do you mean after the censorship power grab and starting to effect people s livelihoods is dangerous territory for these corporations or do you mean dangerous that people who are being silenced and now pickpocketed will become an actual threat  Just curious because both options are dangerous but the first tends to lead to the second.  When banks and corporations start stopping people getting paid or run a business that is dangerous. It is bad enough not having a voice and yes one does lead to another like you said  but start denying money or jobs and people absolutely will have nothing left to lose.  Exactly and it seems the powers that be are clueless of this fact as they continue to find new ways to poke the bear  seriously stop poking the bear  I say that in jest but this could get seriously out of hand   Don  39 t they understand they are making what they have been afraid of all this time.  I honestly believe this is a planned and coordinated attempt to force people into violence that they can blame on the right and use it to push their gun agenda no matter the cost  the media was inundated and still is with interviews with all the leftist politicians who were fearing for their lives and the PTSD they now have from the capital incident. They are actively calling for the removal of all conservative politicians who objected to the electoral votes  which is literally something they do every year a republican is elected and to top it off their objections are on the basis of fraud.  Then when they try to push through their gun agenda they make even more crazies  I hope they understand what they are doing.  A little quote with modern terminology   Let it.  It  39 s better it comes to a head  rather than slowly eating away at the country forever.  Dangerous for us or them   Btw PayPal is entirely owned by China  Exactly what I was thinking. I m convinced the past year has all been a foreign attack by China. Legitimately. They want us on board with what they re doing to the world and our leaders are allowing it due to fear  That s legit all I can think of. No one born in America  or even immigrants to America should be behind this mess.  Have they blocked the Groups that bail out leftist rioters   No. They have not. And if they have  the never made it public.  No  they just get cheated into the White House.  If you want to buy heroin on the dark web  PayPal is happy to help.  PayPal wasn  39 t secure enough to stop someone from hijacking my account but at least they stopped my account from being drained. I never unlocked my account so I don  39 t need to boycott them.

The  quot source quot  being the journalist  39 s imagination.  And while Trump has been cut off from comms so he can  39 t defend himself.

It s got to be. Human nature. Orwell is being thrown around a lot. People are learning and buying. I suffered through the first part of the movie a while ago and turned it off. Very interested in watching it through now.  Don  39 t watch it. The movie is crap. Read the book. That  39 s actually got the best arguments he  39 s trying to make.  Personally  I find animal farm to make a bit of a finer point and it s a quicker read but they re both great.  The movie is okay but the book is really great.  It s a cool book. You should read it.  This will no doubt sound ridiculous but I  39 m actually a little concerned for what  39 s happening to America. I know an over reaction and I  39 m sure I  39 ll be mocked and torn to pieces in replies but watching this from the outside  UK  and knowing the laws that have been passed here and having always seen America as the last place of true freedom I  39 m actually a little concerned.   Only a little  Just come out and say it   we re in SERIOUS trouble. People need to wake up.  As a Brit I m trying to hide my emotions but Yh I think you guys are in major trouble especially if you don t conform and agree.  Our nation was founded opposing tyranny. Things could get ugly with the armed citizenry.  That s what I m thinking will be next. The only place I know of that has people and leaders who are pro gun is Texas who seem to be ready to defend their rights. Not sure about the other States.  That  39 s not as true as it once was. Not too long ago Robert Francis  quot Beto quot  Ororke narrowly lost to Ted Cruz.  States like South Dakota and Wyoming are much more red but they  39 re a lot smaller.  Oh. I only ever see or hear about Texas being pro gun etc but Yh I m sure there s more.  The worst thing about the way the world is going is that it was the UK that gave the world the concept of personal liberty and natural rights.  In many ways the cradle of the philosophy that enabled western civilisation.  And the brits seem to have happily thrown that all away.    Yh even the constitution was in part inspired by the magna carter. The U.K. isn t a bastion of freedom anymore. There are some laws that have been brought in to change that and London alone has more cameras looking at the population that I think any other major city in Europe. I ve even seen politicians giving interviews and talking about vaccine certificates or QR codes on their phones to say you ve been given your vaccine. I can t be sure on the whole but it seems the U.K. isn t paying attention to how much we are losing including recent reports about the police wanting the right to enter people s home during the pandemic to break up  illegal gatherings .   I think the problem is comfort.  People  especially those whose idea of travelling is to go to resort hotels  have no idea how hard to obtain and fragile civilisation is  and how shitty life still is for many people  particularly those without freedom   property rights  etc.  We  39 ve had a pretty good run for the last few years  and so people think they have the luxury of destroying it all for their personal benefit and nothing will go wrong.    You ve pretty much hit the nail on the head there. I think since modern smart phones we ve become a people who spend 90  of their time looking at their phone screen than the world around them. It s how politicians and the powerful get away with their BS.  You  39 re overreacting... until you  39 re not.  For people that condemn the third reich every chance they get  they sure do love using their methods.  I m so tired of being called a Nazi for caring about basic human rights  while the fuckers calling it are plagiarizing the playbook  I feel you  brother. Just a few days back I got a DM calling me a fascist  and comparing Trump to Hitler.  It honestly feels like we  39 re in some kind of information civil war with some members of the left. Literally anything conservative is attempted to be branded as a far right conspiracy theory.  They also like to ignore the fact that Nazi was alang for National SOCIALIST party. They werent even right wing  the government people controlled the ecobomy and the means of production  everyone had a job  most got paid the same  and it was SOCIALISM  with a dash of nationalism for Germany.  All socialists are nationalistic historically. Like saying they aren  39 t ia being ignorant of history. However the confusion comes when we compare the American right and left vs the rest of the world.    deleted   Projection.  I think it s to rationalize their animosity. They know conservatives aren t Nazis especially the top ones the elite rich Democrats and party insiders. They ve grown more and more vitriolic and it has to be rationalized somehow you can t be this blatantly hypocritical unless you establish a foundation of justification. That s all the constant attacks and defamation are. That way when it comes to actually silencing us it s easily portrayed as  silencing radicals . The sheep has no idea I graduated from a Cal State this last spring trust me when I say my peers are some of the most ignorant people who consider themselves some of the most informed. They have zero idea what the average Republican or conservative believe only the caricature they ve been given.  Kinda like Animal Farm    removed   No  it  39 s OK you see. By definition the only voices being silenced are Nazi ones so there  39 s no problem with this  see   Reminds me of witch trials.  quot Oh  maybe she wasn  39 t... Never mind  it  39 s too late to care anyway. Neeeeext   quot    quot Maybe she wasn  39 t a witch  but we can  39 t take any risks... quot   You mean like 99  of them standing around outside  Or do you include those who were waving Trump banners as also being part of the violence   I didn t expect anyone to break into the capital building. Just though conservatives were better than that overall.  The were  strong LET IN  strong  by the DC POLICE  Except we didn  39 t get a brand new flat screen tv  a dishwasher  or even a pair of Jordan  39 s out of it.  Naw... instead of sneakers they got a few souvenirs out of the offices of members of congress and stole some camera equipment from the press. And one guy apparently decided he wanted a podium for some reason.  They also went all in on silencing political opponents after blaming them for an attack on the German capitol which included many Nazis posing as their political opponents.  Here I thought liberals didn  39 t like history.   Reminds me of all the Facebook trolls and Twittertards talking about how the capitol riot was all about  white privelege   Reddit banned the Donald for threatening cops then not even a year later all of reddit was relishing in the death of police.  The attacking  I hate calling it that. A couple hundred people who walked around aimlessly and took photos for the most most part. I know some broke a few windows and stole a laptop.  seat of power sounds too much like the reichstag fire too me for my liking.  lol the brigading is real.  Yeah I mean shit I even think I  39 m getting alarmist at times but damn it if everything about this shit doesn  39 t feel wrong and like it is going to end badly.

So  as Amazon is selling books that promote violence and revolt eg  quot Mein Kampf quot   does that mean that AWS  Amazon web services  wiil now refuse to host Amazon.  s  Yeah  I m starting to buy books like 1984  animal farm  nicomachean ethics  federalist papers  etc. basically books that are important to western civilization and liberty. Also getting them from Barnes and noble so I don t help Amazon.  Lol  I just noticed.  B amp N isn  39 t much better. Buy from a local bookstore if you can.

I d argue it s better than 1984 because it portrays authoritarian governments as they actually are  completely impotent in terms of tech and standard of living.    This is a combination of 1984 and Brave New World.  It  39 s an important read for every adult. At least something good came from this madness.  Just purchased Animal Farm and 1984. Genuinely believe they could be pulled in the coming years.  Don t forget Huxley. Both Orwell and Huxley have been right so far. I recommend A Brave New World  Does BNW get better  I m around chapter 3 and I genuinely feel like I m dragging myself through it even though I usually really like dystopian books  It s kinda bland in all honesty. Nothing super compelling  but the ideas it proposes are. Try an audiobook if you can t get into it. YouTube has free ones. That s what I did  Oh dang  it seemed like it could have just been all the exposition that was getting me down. I ll give the audiobook a try though   For sure. Read all of these  even in high school not too long ago  just never owned them. Also good to have them in physical copy rather than electronic  Along with Fahrenheit 451...  Instead of being pulled I imagine having the next generation not read them is a very real possibility. If my teachers hadn t put those two books in my hand I don t know if I ever would ve read them.  Not even kidding I m doing the same  In the way we re heading anything s possible.  Me too. I feel the book burning is not far away.  They think it s an instruction manual.  I wonder if any stores moved it to nonfiction category.  All this censorship is truly frightening  and I see it mostly coming from the left. Now that the democrats are in power  censorship will only continue to grow  I wouldn t be surprised if they pulled these books from the public.  Or they  39 ll try to convince everyone that 1984 has a happy ending.  Also in the Fascist Playbook   burning books. Don t think for a second they can t take these books off the internet if it doesn t fit a narrative.  I am wondering if it is top selling because the left and tech companies need a how to guide refresher.  If you haven t read it yet  don t. It s terrifying.  I  39 m not planning to  what  39 s the point if we  39 re already living it   I was actually considering purchasing Rules for Radicals myself.  I would buy this book  but I  39 ve read it like 3 times... and the world is getting to be more like  quot Brave New World quot  instead.    Huh. Pelosi is the pig   That s animal farm but still relevant.  Didn  39 t the farmer feed the pig lots of expensive ice cream   Democrats purchasing instruction manuals.  Ironic.  1984   2021  May be more like Starship Troopers by the time this is all done  No kidding. Endless pointless wars to enrich the political elite  soon to be removed from amazon and audible  I just bought my father in law a copy of Animal Farm for Christmas. He had never read either that or Animal Farm and after a late night of talking politics one night he found a copy of 1984 and breezed through it. So I figured he might as well have animal Farm too.

Experience has shown that communities faced with epidemics or other adverse events respond best and with the least anxiety when the normal social functioning of the community is least disrupted.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv98qk/a_flu_pandemic_paper_by_epidemiologists_including/,Hey the scientist know what s best for everyone right   Must follow the science   These lockdowns are designed to make us fear  because as long as we are fearing a virus  we arent going to be upset st tbe government for their hypocritical and unconstitutional rules amd laws being implemented.  That s going off the assumption that these lockdowns aren t specifically designed to create adverse reactions from people...tons of qualified individuals have come out in opposition to lockdowns yet here we are still   ... and Quebec is under COVID martial law   Doesn t sound like a ringing endorsement of lockdowns   Or  you know  when the truth is actually told.

t3_kvbssv,FBI internal memo warns of plans for armed protests in all 50 state capitals ahead of Biden inauguration,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvbssv/fbi_internal_memo_warns_of_plans_for_armed/,I have some friends that are crazy lunatic fringe on the right. It  39 s been both funny and scary to watch the shit they are posting lately. This seems like some of their stuff. There is one making the rounds on the far right now about how Apple is going to to an iOS update to remove the emergency alert system from phones because that is how Trump will be communicating with the country once the military action begins. I  39 m serious. They are out there talking about that shit right now.  I did get an alert that there will be an update on my iPhone tonight.  Pretty sure they can  39 t remove the EAS.  They can do what they want because they re a private company.  s  Does anyone mind explaining this to me   More manufactured political violence  more censorship  more of the left pretending their riots didn  39 t burn down city blocks and kill dozens of people.   quot FBI  who has a history of framing Republicans  plants excuse for rounding up Trump supporters and increased censorship on the Internet. quot    removed   The FBI sure do love writing fanfiction.   removed 
t3_kur2zz,In Poland Social Media Companies Censoring A Post Could Be Fined 2 Million,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kur2zz/in_poland_social_media_companies_censoring_a_post/,Eastern Europe knows a thing or two about totalitarians and their propaganda methods.  You know me personally  being born in Slovakia  which belonged for decades under communist rule  am feeling terribly disturbed by the amount of censorship going on in USA. For ages here in Eastern Europe the USA was the bastion for democracy and free speech  we were all incredibly jealous of you. But the recent events is really really scary and I actually fear for your country. I definitely don t want to live under China we all prefer much more USA. Be strong my friends  I hope the division in your country will decrease and that you will become stronger because of it. But I worry it might not be the case  My mom and her siblings grew up in USSR controlled Ukraine in a poor Christian family. And they had to hide their bibles so well incase the KGB came. To me that  39 s not that bad  what  39 s she told me that is the scariest is that NO ONE spoke out against the government or openly said they were a Christian for fear of being put in jail  beaten  or in some cases even disappear.   But I thought Democrats were the one  em saving  em  us from fascism   It  39 s a misleading headline. If you read more  it  39 s actually a negative move by the current authoritarian leaning government party to force government regulations on private businesses. I suggest reading a few more articles.   It  39 s depressing to me that you  39 re being downvoted bc you aren  39 t spreading misinformation like others. I appreciate you adding context.  Its fine   to be honest most of the disinformation is just lack of context   if you don  39 t live there you only get the headlines and a few paragraphs  so you  39 ll only get one or two sources and likely never see it again.  Fair enough. Thank you for the insight  No problem   it  39 s a muddy issue and there  39 s a lot of disinformation   in general I don  39 t think government regulations of private businesses fall in line with conservative values  You mean there is mass disinformation in a country that forces platforms to allow conspiracy  falsehood  and out right lies to be propagated or face fines  Color me surprised.  Getting downvotes for your post is the equivalent of the dipshits in this community shoving their fingers in their ears and going  lala I can t hear you    Let s just say Poland is familiar with suppressing ideologies.    39 LGBT free zone.  39   especially Poland     Yeah  they  39 re turning towards it again. Hello Hungary   People on Parler or Twitter would be clobbered by fines if they lives in Poland. They ban hate speech over there.  Parler should host from Poland. Krakow has a big tech hub.  The sword cuts both ways though. From the article   I  39 d agree. Terrorist material is pretty vague  given what happened in the US and how the term domestic terrorism is so loosely thrown around. However pedo shit and suicide is pretty cut and dry  and this seems to be a step in the right direction.  Yeah  however free speech is a tricky subject. Look the first big one that really came up on reddit and change its direction  the jailbait subreddit.  That s an actual sub  I m scared to even check because it s so disgusting   It was banned many years ago.   Yeah  I can see that.   So is free speech basically dead or on its way out everywhere in the world now   Poland has hate speech laws  so it would last about 10 minutes.  Nah us Europeans kinda don  39 t want anything to do with your politics in our land....figure your own shit out  Odd... Europe always wants the US on its side when Russia gets uncomfortable  or when there is a natural disaster.  Poland is the Silicon Valley of Europe  So you  39 re saying use a VPN and set location to Poland   Have to be a Polish national I  39 m afraid to get them fined.  So your saying maybe Chicago too   s  Would that let people get around the  quot flaired users only quot  blocks and or post endless bot spam   They got taken over by the Nazis and The commies. When they say never again they mean it.  Don  39 t forget Prussia Austria Imperial Russia taking a crack at it in the past too.  They have kept the refugees out  banned most abortions  and will fine a social justice warrior factory  2M for censoring.  The gun laws are loosening there as well. Concealed carry and now they are loosening up on cartridge restrictions.  They  39 re soon out of EU if tgey continue their path. Too bad they rely on EU money...  Gun laws are a national competency. See the Czech Republic as an example.  Czech...yeah...The gold standard of EU  There is no way to kick out an EU member state. With Hungary supporting them  there s no way to strip their voting rights too.  They  39 re following Czechia.  Makes you wonder far all of this goes back   Just..dude Poland is not the role model you should be holding up right now. I thought conservatives were against communism.  Very sadly  the sub won  39 t care what you say...     Its just weird how these countries that were actualky oppressed by a totalitarian regime not too long ago are really big on this whole freedom thing.  It  39 s a misleading headline. If you read more  it  39 s actually a negative move by the current authoritarian leaning government party to force government regulations on private businesses. I suggest reading a few more articles.   I live here too and it  39 s hilarious seeing people think our country is a bastion of freedom or something of the sort.  Tell me about it lmao. I do think Poland needs change but not the change PiS wants   We re totes free  Now hold my judicial system     PiS in a nutshell  Businesses can  39 t just do whatever they want. That  39 s why there  39 s minimum wage laws  wrongful terminations laws  harassment laws etc. When a company gets so big it becomes bigger than the government then rules need to be put in place.  Ok  that  39 s a fair viewpoint.  Minimum government intervention is very good but are you OK with being under the complete rule of thumb of a corporation  Imagine having to obey a corporations rules or you won  39 t be able to get a job  get a loan  travel etc. That  39 s what  39 s happening right now.   quot Really big on freedom quot  except you can get arrested for badmouthing religion.  Who knew we could learn from Poland when it comes to the 1st amendment  Former communist countries generally tend to do a lot better than us at sensing danger.   You know a thing or two when you ve seen a thing or two   You have to understand that our current generation of 20 something socialists communists in the U.S. is far smarter and has much more wisdom than any previous generation  they know exactly what to do to make socialism communism work for the betterment of humankind. It will finally be the Utopia the left has always wanted. All the other failures of socialism communism  like very low quality of life  killing of dissidents  oppression by the government  etc.  were due to how dumb the people were  not because socialism communism is a crazy pipe dream that always leads to economic ruin and the slaughter of innocent people.  Had me in the first half.  Lmao nice one  They also aren t riven with division and racial witch hunts caused by multiculturalism.  You guys literally don  39 t understand the first ammendment its actually incredible.  Thank you  It  39 s only ok to refuse when it goes against their beliefs. The cake shop can refuse a gay couple and Kim Davis can refuse to give out marriage licenses and both are heroes.  Ok  I view conservative values as desiring less government regulations so perhaps we will not agree. Thanks for the reply though   I don  39 t think you understand what you  39 re saying. The worst of Parler wouldn  39 t last a minute under Poland  39 s comprehensive hate speech laws.  You really can  39 t. If you want to learn from Poland towards the 1st ammendment then you would take over state nd public media  use it for propaganda and call any source of criticism a paedophile. Fire judiciaries at will and make it illegal for them to criticise other appointees. Sure they have freedom of speech so long as it is the right speech that they approve of.  Might be time to head home to the motherland.  We shouldn  39 t run when tyranny makes it move. We need to stay and fight it. Conservatives need to get clever. We can  39 t post on theses forums anymore  we need to decentralize communication as fast as we possibly can  and form political action groups. Now.   Used to have a low opinion of Eastern bloc countries but I was wrong. They are actually the last bastions of traditional values left in Europe. Modernized 1st world western countries are now just degenerates. A soft life breeds fools  I moved from the west to an eastern block country  and let me tell you  it  em feels so good.  em   Is crime decreasing these days   Yeah. Mafia crime is on the down and down  murders being regularly solved  very low petty crime  I ve never heard anyone get mugged here  even when walking in alleyways at 2am  whereas many of my friends back west have been .  Sounds like the life bro   THEY remember what communists afflicted them with  God bless Poland and Hungary  last bastions of Europe  You can tell which country understands the most about leftism.  No substitute for experience with those motherfuckers.  It  39 s a misleading headline. If you read more  it  39 s actually a negative move by the current authoritarian leaning government party to force government regulations on private businesses. I suggest reading a few more articles.   I guess we  39 re screwed no matter where we try to go.  Poland showing us how the first ammendment works.  Conservatives praising government stepping in to check private corporations  As someone on the far left  I am happy to see this      Free speech lives somewhere  at least.  Not in Poland it doesn  39 t  It definitely doesn  39 t live in this subreddit.  Why is Poland so based  In Poland  they put you in jail for waving a rainbow flag.  How is Poland with immigration  Is it easy to migrate there for a job  USA and most of Europe will have fascist takeovers in the next 10 years. The Democrats could have 2 3rd majority in most states. And the constitution maybe unrecognizable.  you won  39 t like their salary pay scale   D  Ok. Can I plan to retire there   I am pretty sure you do. Language is the most complex in European countries  but yours usd will be valuable there.   At this point I don  39 t care for an agreeable society. Just a society that will leave me alone. Looks like the polish have at least some setup for this. I  39 m hoping that it will be immune from George Soros 20 years from now. But that is doubtful     go to Hungary then  they really hate him there    Good suggestion. Thank you.  Any country George boogeyman Soros doesn  39 t have a vested interest in is reasonably okay  Hopefully they re prepared for an onslaught of Russian trolls and disinformation. Will be Ukraine all over again.  At what point do we say that people need to moderate what they  39 re reading and use their critical thought   Yes  I agree  that is certainly a valid approach and has its own pros and cons. On the internet  laws like this create an arms race for bots and troll farms. Social media sites can quickly be flooded with disinformation by whichever party seeks to influence a situation most. In Poland s case they are squeezed between the EU and Russia  and Russia would love to spread disinformation unimpeded to the Polish electorate and install Russian friendly legislatures just like they did in Ukraine.   It  39 s not going to work though. Combine bots with something like GPT 3 and all the threads are literally flooded with texts indistinguishable from what a person would write. This would completely kill discussion boards like reddit.  No it won t. Ukraine has a Russian minority population that literally wants to be annexed by Russia  where s pretty much everyone in Poland hates Russia. Not comparable at all  Nice  I think Krakow is on my visitation list.  Never thought I d imagine emigrating from the US.  Don  39 t go to Krak w  too touristy IMO. Hit up Wroc aw  Prague isn  39 t too far if you want to visit there too  or Gda sk if you prefer the ocean.  I ll consider it.  Maybe Warsaw too.  You guys really shouldn  39 t take current Poland as a rolemodel  we  39 re becoming complete shithole under the rulership of PIS.  Too bad this law doesn t apply to USA  It  39 s going to take actions like this to get anything done. We  39 ve lost the government in America. Our DNC overlords will never do anything against their tech partners.  lul saying anything about poland  like it isn  39 t going down the authoritarian path  i know that i live here.  Come on guys make your mind up. Do you want private companies to have more or less power   Less political power.  It is so sad that our voices are being silenced. This is the country that was founded on freedom and we are having our voices taken away.  Conservatives praising government stepping in to check private corporations  As someone on the far left  I am happy to see this      I would bet that we see a reform of social media within the next 6 months. They can t allow this to happen. This is all a ply on the president before the 20th. After that they ll let it go.  Hey guys  pretty cool to see a non flair required post around here  Pretty smart to do it for this particular content.    I really don t mean this to sound how it s going to sound  but doesn t that mean that subreddits like this one would be a legal hellhole to support for users in Poland   Here though  So... you re asking for more governmental regulation   Government regulation is why these companies are so powerful in the first place. The only option is to fight fire with fire.  They  39 re also no longer a proper functioning democracy. The ruling PiS party bullies journalists with fines and lawsuits and forced a  strong third of their supreme court  strong  into retirement. In 2018 they adopted a censorship law that makes it illegal to implicate Polish involvement in the Holocaust.  Yes  exactly. Thank you that someone understands the current situation  Y all realize that the Polish policy entails the government compelling a private company to publish speech  right  The stronger first Amendment position is the current policy in the US  where the government doesn t have that power. Just so we re clear on what is  pro first amendment  here.  Good  then move to Poland.  So pack up your shit and go to Poland. Then you  39 ll have nothing to cry about. Easy.  I wonder if they would allow a terrorist to make claims of an attack on social media. That s basically why Twitter and all the others did what they did. They don t want racism or attacks on america to get posted. It s pretty simple. Does it hurt their freedom of speech to no longer be allowed to spew their hatred  yes  Good. Is it illegal  No. These companies can do whatever they want to and ban whoever they want to for whatever reason they want to. First amendment has nothing to do with being allowed to post hatred for America on your page.  Time for everyone 2 get a polish account  This is the only non flair required post I can find in the top ten. Like many other left leaning but more central Redditors ive observed this sub for a while.   Ahh Poland  the bastion of Democracy and Freedom  Funny because of how this sub operates  The question is  do we have to go through what Poland did to get to this point  Are we at the beginning of a extremely frightening half century of oppression   Poland continues to impress me.  Parlor should just set up their own locations.  It d probability be cheaper than what they pay Ama on.  It will always be weird to me the way people pick and choose when we can use other countries as an example of how we should run ours. Have you seen their gun laws  They might get this one right but by and large they are a shit show lol  Based Poland  Let  39 s hope some thing comes from all this that shows both sides how important 1A actually is.  In other news    a href   r conservative  rel  nofollow   r conservative  a  users rail against impingement on their freedom of speech in flaired only posts with zero sense of irony  Now this is something I could get behind. Hmm.  We know a thing or two because we ve seen a thing or two  So sad  big state deciding over private companies in their rules...

t3_kveft3,Rex Murphy Dont even try to pretend theres such a thing as free speech anymore,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kveft3/rex_murphy_dont_even_try_to_pretend_theres_such_a/,I don  39 t understand how we allow people to be targeted for their political beliefs. I understand that it isnt a protected class   but shouldn  39 t it be  We grant political asylum for citizens of other countries while simultaneously allowing citizens to  quot cancel quot  other citizens because they believe differently than one another.   I agree with you in principle  but it  39 s clear that the framework in which free and open discourse can occur has been deliberately upended in order to make ideological differences appear  em existential  em . The promotion of such concepts of speech as violence   quot hate speech quot   and so on have insured a situation where not only are  em verboten  em  beliefs and speech  as defined by self positioned social gatekeepers  punishable as existential threats  allowing room for the expression of those beliefs becomes a punishable threat in itself. Censorship and cancellation have become virtues. This wasn  39 t accidental.  Also the usage of nouns to dehumanize people  so that you don  39 t have to consider their opinion  because you no longer  I guess on a subconscious level  think of them as people. The right does this  leftist   but not nearly as much as the right  Trumpists  covidiots  hicks  etc.  fly over country  it goes on and on .  If half of America is cheering that parler was deplatformed then it s only a matter of time until they cheer the government doing the same. If the freedom to say what what s on your mind becomes  violence  and the government and apple are justified in preventing you from speaking  we are lost.  Interesting to see the responses from around the world about this issue. Kinda gives me some hope that leftists in other parts of the world appear to stick by their principles  wtf is wrong with them in the US   Facts this country try is fucking sad right now

t3_kv7dl0,Twitter Hasnt Suspended These Accounts That Openly Incite Violence,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv7dl0/twitter_hasnt_suspended_these_accounts_that/,Twitter   quot Oh this death to america tweet is perfectly fine. quot   It  39 s why what they are doing is so blatantly obvious. They make their claims and then it  39 s incredibly easy to go find countless high profile situations where Twitter didn  39 t follow their own rules.  Love the non flaired brigaders trying to comment on this one.  Honestly if Twitter just came out and said  we re banning right wing accounts because we don t like it   no one would be mad.    They can  39 t though because they would be declaring themselves publishers.  They re declaring themselves publishers anyway when they ban the president and lie about him inciting violence  while allowing Slate to say violence is explicitly ok  I agree. It  39 s obvious to everyone yet the media continues to gas light.  All those media references to  far right Parler   in a sane world Twitter would always be described as  hard left activist network Twitter .  This is why they need to lose 230 protection.  It is fine if they as a private company want to ban people according to their own rules. When they don  39 t apply those rules evenly though  it shows they are picking and choosing what they will allow. That is called being a publisher.  A bunch of hypocrites who can  39 t handle mean tweets. They  39 re so sensitive.   No it didn  39 t and no it won  39 t.  Antifa routinely uses both Twitter and Facebook to stage violent actions  without penalty.  The violence isn  39 t an issue for tech  the ideology is.  We  39 d do well to move on.  Twitter and Facebook want echo chambers.  Let them have them.  It isn  39 t as though conservatives aren  39 t used to mainstream censorship.  And yet  the ideology endures and will continue to.

Google maps lists businesses that  quot identify as female run quot   Why not help all small businesses that are in distress regardless of the race or gender of the owner   because he and his cronies would prefer to discriminate to keep their voters happy  How about any small business that s in the dump because we re all in the dump  Whether it s minority owned  woman owned  male owned...who gives a fuck   Help the ones in need  Wait so given his logic  it s acceptable to make decisions based on race  He seems to be stuck in the 18th century mindset of racism.   Ridiculous bullshit. Ridiculous how the media and ruling class has made everything about race nowadays.

As if it wasn  39 t bad enough  she was apparently teaching a class for learning disabled students.  I live in the general area and life is basically normal here except you are expected to wear a mask when you go into a store etc. I guess you could technically refuse and get away with it but virtually nobody bothers anymore.  I  39 ve seen plenty of employees in back rooms going about their business without masks though.  Yep this is how it is for me in GA. Most places are open  even for dine in. They just try to space people out a bit and require a mask when walking around. Only exception I can find is Gyms don  39 t require masks to use  but require a temp check  and they have really tried to space people out on top of being kinda serious for wiping the machines benches down.  Ohio is completely up to the district. Mine has been doing hybrid and we are back in person next week.  Kids here have been attending school in person since August. It  39 s been mostly uneventful  and Florida is right in the middle of the pack in terms of case rates.  As they should be.  Which part   This teacher could potentially face a punch in the throat as well.  I hate teachers who do shit like this and giggle about it.  Honestly I hate most teachers.  People think back fondly of the 3 great teachers they had growing up and forgot that they had about 40 that ranged from adequate to absolute shit.  So true. But the three great ones were SO good  and so life changing  and so much more worth remembering. But the rest were lame  insecure  abusive  immature  and stupid.  My favorite teacher in high school was amazing. Supported every kid  engaged with the disengaged kids  me  and was just all around awesome. He was black and most of my school was Hispanic native white. He basically hates white people now  and anyone who isn  39 t super progressive. It  39 s really hurtful and sad.  What  39 s funny is I only remember maybe 10 teachers at all. ie I couldn  39 t even name or picture many more than that. lol. And don  39 t really remember more than 1 or 2 who I thought were that great. One was clearly some racist black woman  though.  then the one good one I remember right off was black and not racist.  p  .  Even my best teacher  the one that really got me excited about going to class  I realize now was very friendly to socialism and he also dated a student the year after she graduated lol  lol. well at least that is legal  although most people would frown on it.  Legal but wildly inappropriate. But  teachers unions.  I had a lot of good teachers  I only really remember the bad ones. The worst was my 8th grade math teacher who did nothing but start the class saying we were all worthless sacks of human garbage and do that the entirety of the period every day for both semesters.   lol. I didn  39 t have any that bad. Just a few slightly cranky ones. I had one teacher who got driven to a nervous breakdown by students  though  which was sad.      Teachers are mostly failures.   It is just me or does she look like the  a href  https   i.ytimg.com vi oXmgU aY NI maxresdefault.jpg  Heaven  39 s Gate  a  dude   The same wide eyed look of insanity.

Covid is a mental disease as well as viral one  The mental part is a common symptom of TDS.  Hysteria rules the day.  Unfortunately  I went to a liberal arts college not for the beliefs but because they had the major I wanted. There was tons of pandering and things thrown at students including myself.   Friend of mine in college got an F on a presentation because he did it on Saudi Arabia sponsoring terrorism . A Saudi kid started yelling at him that he was lying . He took it up with the department chair and won  because nothing in his report was untrue.  I  39 m sure we all had teachers that would do this kind of shit. They  39 re usually super anal about everything and in their own little world.  Just because other teachers could do shitty things does not she mean she should not be protected.  Reminds me of the  quot Florida man quot  memes lmfao  Jesus Chrisssssttt    Good. She even looks like the type.  I recognize it too. I bet she likes to idolize native American to the point where it  39 s more of a fetish. Probably has way too many pictures of her cats.

t3_kv8t5e,Save the Constitution From Big Tech,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv8t5e/save_the_constitution_from_big_tech/,Great refutation of the BuT tHeYrE PriVaTe CoMpAniEs crap that people use to defend this poisonous  un American behavior.  I hope that they can find them in violation of anti trust law.  The ability to remove people from society better be in violation of anti trust.

t3_kvia5c,CNN pulls combative questioner Jim Acosta from White House beat with Biden set to take office,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvia5c/cnn_pulls_combative_questioner_jim_acosta_from/,Biden needs the 5th degree questioning Acosta gave Trump. But we all know Acosta would lob him softballs and it would be even more apparent how hypocritical the network is  hence this move   quot Regarding what  39 s going on right now  Mr President  what is your favorite dinosaur  quot   Biden is his own favorite dinosaur  Don  39 t you make fun of him  He  39 s a Civil War hero    Is it a T Rex  Guys  it s a T Rex  So cool   He says a Biden stares into space and starts drooling.  You mean slob them soft balls like the Democrat stooge he is.  So is this a promotion or a demotion  Because Mr look at me  I m Jim Acosta Surely wouldn t be as combative with a liberal president. No.  What delighted and enchanted you about your first year as president  Obama    Trump made his career  Trump made his career  a joke   there ya go    Remember Obama ignored the whitehouse press like the plague...  Couldn t have happened to a nicer guy.  sup   sup s  sup   sup   It  39 s not like Biden will actually let the press ask him unscripted questions.  Man Jim had a lot of cringe moments the past four years  They should send Acosta to cover the protest in some state capital on the 50th... It would be great footage.
t3_kup7ax,Citibank says it will not support candidates who do not respect the rule of law and will pause contributions to the GOP members who objected to certifying Bidens election.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kup7ax/citibank_says_it_will_not_support_candidates_who/, quot Just build your own international banking system. quot   This kind of already has been done  cryptocurrency.  I knew this would happen but I figured it would take a little while...  How long before anyone associated with conservatives or Republicans are not allowed to access any banks at all    removed    removed    removed    removed    removed    removed    removed   Dark times ahead  Buy BTC ETH fuck a bank  If BTC gets mainstream it  39 s going to be banned and outlawed before you can spell  quot p a r l e r quot .  Chase and PayPal banned Laura loomer 3 years ago  Oh  I wouldn  39 t be surprised it that happened in the next 92 hours...  Or buy guns or anything that isn  39 t approved by IMF and Globalists.  So you re telling me I ll be able to trust those politicians more since they ll be receiving less money from special interests.  I think it is a win  If only they would do it for all politicians.  But objecting to the certification is in the law... And this isn  39 t even unusual. The Dems objected in 2000  2004 and 2016.  So we need to start sending the lists of Dems who did this shit to the companies having a meltdown  yeah   Definitely  Where s the list of Dems  and the EECB email list for Citibank   Shit  39 s Orwellian in the least.  This should be top comment  and should be first response to anyone who makes this dumb point that objecting to certification of electoral votes is some sort of great crime.  Yea pelosi has objected before.   Asking to investigate an election is illegal now   Crying  quot election fraud quot  is ONLY acceptable if you are a Leftist.  Wait and the left says you can change and everyone has to respect it else they lose there woke badge   Where were the banks when Democrats objected to electors for both Trump and Bush  Hmmm   Both Bushes  Thanks. I thought so  but was too lazy to double check. I couldn  39 t remember if it was both Bushes or W both times.  It is entirely constitutional to object to an election certification.  The problem here is you think the left cares about the Constitution.  Jokes on them  we  39 ll all be broke due to hyper inflation soon anyway  And lockdowns.  DO NOT COMPLY   When are conservative companies going to start throwing their weight around  If we re playing this game  I m happy to change my spending habits.  Corporations only hire you if you have a degree in any positions of power.  People with degrees now days are woke college kids with blue hair.  All companies leadership is liberals.  Are there any   I really think the only way the other side gains any momentum is some gigantic company or ultra wealthy speak out or help. Like Elon Musk or something. IDK  I think it  39 s pretty hopeless barring an actual civil conflict  Elon  39 s use signal tweet has had a pretty big impact. He  39 s openly giving the finger to Facebook.  There are no conservative companies or liberal companies. Companies only care about what makes them money. If conservative politics makes them money  they  39 re conservative. If liberal outrage loses them money  they  39 re liberals.  Idk  but it needs to start soon.  So the Democrat party is officially the party of Wall St and the big banks.  Ironic.  have been for a long time  Both are and both always have been. Wall St and big banks donate to politicians on both sides of the aisle.  Citibank has actually been doing this stuff for a while. Look at all the people that got Trump elected back in 2016  they were pretty much purged.  I have similar feelings. I m furious with the GOP.  CC companies should have no right to forbid any legal transactions.  The banks smell blood now too   I ve used Citibank for almost two decades. Looks like I ll be closing all my accounts with them this week.  Make sure you let them know why   removed   What about the dems who objected to Trump and Bush   Memory holed  Amen.  That  39 s literally part of the law...  Since it is safe to say federal Democrats will not object given the extent to which it aligns with their politics  I guess it is time for Republican AGs to start throwing around their weight.  Last I checked  objections are part of the rule of law.  Good to know the morons in citi Bank dont know that objecting is 100  legal and in the constitution   removed   Their actions say that yes  they sure do.  This is fucking absurd.  Citibank doesn t exactly have a  rule of law  reputation from the past if my memory serves me well.  Again  none of this would be an issue  if they couldn  39 t donate in the first place  How about if they don  39 t support any of them and just stick to banking rather than buying our politicians   shittibank  And then quietly restart them next year as they ve done for decades.  Umm.. the constitution literally is the highest law in the land... how is following this document not respecting the rule of law again   Kind of funny all these big corporations suddenly care about law and order  They didn t seem worried when their buildings were being looted by the  law abiding left  and the crew encouraged it.  Quotes from around the sub that are super relevant in this topic for sure     If everyone s pausing donations to republicans all this means is that republicans won t be held back by corporate interests and less corruption in the gop. We might start seeing true conservatives.  The irony I guess is that Trump and everyone objecting was following  quot the law quot .  Let s not forget that this election was stolen  and Trump voters have a right to be mad  protest and object.  Citibank was Obama  39 s cabinet. Ironic they accuse others of not respecting the rule of law.  Seven months of rioting and looting from Anita and BLM and it  39 s only now that they concern themselves with the rule of law.  Another card to cancel. Bye CitiCommunist   Chase did something similar last year if I recall.  I thought of this tonight but couldn  39 t remember the exact verse. Thank you.  Did they contribute to the Dems that objected to Trump s certification   So I guess the Dems are shit out of luck then..  Man... if this shit backfires all these companies will be fucked. Righteously fucked.  They won t  Josh Hawley thanks you for your inkind donation

t3_kvcpmg,One of the largest talkradio companies tells hosts they will be fired for claiming election fraud,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvcpmg/one_of_the_largest_talkradio_companies_tells/,If it didn t happen then why is corporate America so committed to banning all discussion of it    So they can do it for 4 years and waste millions of taxpayer dollars based on  evidence  that they literally made up to distract from Clinton s emails but we can t call out actual fraud 4 days later  Ridiculous  I m sure the EIB network could have room for expansion.  Since when is it a radio podcast company  39 s job to  quot induce calm quot  into the country  Their job is to talk about the news  and election fraud is news. The job of keeping the country calm is on the politicians and right now with trying to force the President out  they don  39 t seem to be interested.  Will see over the next couple weeks which of the hosts are truly principled and who are in it for the money.  They tell us to stand strong in support of Trump and all of the hypocrisy of the left  now we  39 ll see which of them are willing to take action rather than just talk tough.  Truth.   Bongino just lost his ass on his Parler investment  he  39 s battling cancer and I  39 m pretty sure his podcast hosts are threatening to cancel on top of being demonetized on YouTube  canceling his Twitter and now you want him to give up his talk radio revenue stream  He  39 s also running a news aggregate site  is invested in Rumble and contributes to Fox News. He  39 s has a lot on his plate right now and he  39 s by no means filthy rich. And god knows how much money Rush has burned through with his cancer treatments.  Rush can afford several life times of cancer treatments. Idk about Dan Bongino  though. I want them both well  and am so not wanting to let Rush go.  Limbaugh net worth is  650 million and earns  83 million annual salary.  If I remember correctly from the days of Obama care when he discussed health care costs he said he self insured. At a minimum he could cover 1000  lifetimes of lung cancer treatments.  Yeah  I was never concerned about him financially being unable to cover costs.  Cumulus is a bunch of fascists  They should all leave.

Josh Hawleys High School Demanding It Condemn The Alumnus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv4bza/in_capitol_riot_aftermath_people_are_contacting/,So he doesn t go to high school yet he will care about a lecture from his old high school  What s next take away his high school diploma   Well at least Stanford and Yale aren  39 t dumb enough to revoke his degrees... But then again Yale did change Calhoun College to Hopper College  You would think the left would be against such a thing. They pay their lives away trying to get this piece of paper. Now imagine the school can say  quot thanks for paying your tab  but even that  39 s not a guarantee  we can still revoke even after you  39 ve paid. quot    quot Oh no my Feminst Dance Theory diploma has been revoked  how will I keep my place as Feminst Dance Specialist in Gender Studies factory  quot   Oh  definitely  they  39 re the best at getting degrees that are absolutely worthless. But now just imagine not only getting a worthless degree that won  39 t land you a job  but now paying out the ass for the school to revoke it. Thus effectively  you wrote a  500 000 check to the school for even less than that already worthless piece of paper.  Protest the town he was born in to revoke his birth certificate so he  39 s now an undocumented immigrant.  s  But then they would have to support him and vie for his vote   Cancel culture at its finest  The rabbit hole of cancel culture knows no bounds. We  39 re seeing it here  and we saw a similar  amp  yet different situation with Parler. The similarity being  quot if we can  39 t knock you down by getting you to submit  we  39 ll go as deep as we can into your life  contact everyone who you associate with  have them disavow and erase you from history until you  39 re no more. quot   Imagine being such a f ing loser that you have time to contact a senator s old high school.  I heard they re going to tell his mom next. He s gonna be in big trouble   And the left still can t see how they contributed to what happened on Jan 6th through their 4 years of harassment hell  lies  insults  verbal and physical attacks.

Oh yeah  it s apparent.  The leftists and Democrats have intentionally been creating the conditions for the perfect storm for over 12 years. The meteorologists in this case being law enforcement of course had very good reason to believe that this storm would hit DC.  Based on the unrest and anger being directed at our government  it makes logical sense that the Capitol City would be ground zero. What wasn  39 t known was the who  where  and how.  This sounds like the blame game  What do you mean KNEW  Did they anticipate  or did they have some sort of foresight   Somebody was mentioning that if they  the capitol police  really thought there was a threat that they have the man power on their own to provide a deterrent and mentioned something like 2000 officers  The 3 er s were talking about storming the capital for weeks publicly  Events like this don  39 t happen in a vacuum  this is a result of cause and effect. One only need to examine history and current events to see the powder keg growing before us. That keg was going to blow regardless of whether or not the FBI or DC Metro stepped in. If they arrested the organizers  it could  39 ve very well have been set off by the Left.   I mean it kinda happens anywhere that there is a fraudulent election to some extent.

I haven t got any personal messages  but every time the suicide one comes up It slightly makes my day better. I d like to see something different though once in a while.  Methinks St. Paul  39 s line in Romans 1 is appropriate here   Professing themselves wise they have become fools.  They don  39 t have to be insane   they just have to be scared enough of the insane people holding the power to sit by and do nothing. That  39 s what concerns me the most.  The sad thing is the brigadiers from  a href   r politics  r politics  a  think you re talking about this subreddit   little do they realize you re talking about the group that s actively trying to deplatform dissenting opinion and deny transparency into the integrity of our electoral process.   quot Flaired users only quot .

It is incredible isn  39 t it  And look how easy it is. They  39 ve managed to make the majority of people think folks with conservative opinions are evil and deserve less rights. Where will it end  I will not be surprised if they start killing conservatives and it  39 s seen as ok because  quot it  39 s ok to kill evil nazis quot . But the irony is they  39 re the evil nazis.  This is a hilarious joke right   Let  39 s keep focus on what  39 s actually happening in this article. Forbes is sayin that if you hire known prodigious liars  they will not take you seriously. Is that saying  quot people with conservative opinions are evil and deserve less rights quot   No... it  39 s not saying that at all... it  39 s saying that if you spend your career spouting demonstrable lies in front of cameras  people aren  39 t going to take you seriously.  When your people invade the capital to terrorize congress   Pre emptive libel.  Smart play  Forbes.  This should be remembered as the weekend that launched ten thousand lawsuits. It all comes down to we are banning  firing  harassing  or discriminating based off what you might do in the future.  And for what you believe in. I don t believe in socialism or communism. For that I can t get hired if I m on a list  This is Nazi Germany all over.  Oh come on  I  39 m about as left as you can get in America and I don  39 t believe in socialism and communism. What you  39 ve got there is a straw man. It  39 s only people directly related to the fomentation of the insurrection riot what have you being blacklisted. Violence is almost always unacceptable as a means to an end in domestic politics.  I do. I regularly call out when people in my political aisle call others Nazis when they are in fact just being authoritarian.  I  39 m a Democrat and I want no part of either socialism or communism. Neither of which would ever ever exist in our nation as it  39 s historically structured. It  39 s a myth  a lie and the sooner we can stop spreading the disinformation on this  the better. There is no communism or socialism coming to America for crying out loud. We  39 ve never been Communist or Socialist and we  39 ve had countless Democratic leaders in this nation. There is always a system of checks and balances and those hold true today. Only recently have we seen that system of checks and balances attacked and it was by Trumpism. This is not an autocracy.    I know  easy to swing a bit wide... like Arnold Dorknegger.  Can  39 t wait for the lawsuits.  When you shit the credibility bed  there are consequences. Imagine that.  This isn t libel  it s just Forbes telling people their opinion. Libel is about statements of fact.  These are wild times. Any historians out there  Has a country ever come back from this to return to freedom  I  39 m willing to take even a hint of evidence that we could return back to normal  and run with it. Because my heart is breaking into a million pieces right now.  Historically  You really don t want to know. Then again  the US has always been something of an exception but it s hard to say if that s due to relative age.  Has there ever been a country with this many checks and balances  Everybody in this sub needs to go read Federalist paper  10. It outlines how the constitution has safeguards in place for destructive factions  only if we remain a virtuous and moral society.  The Construction provided an excellent framework for a sustainable government that respects and promotes individual freedom.   US Constitution works only so long as people are willing to go along with it. US Supreme Court has already noted before that the Constitution is not a suicide pact. It means that if the existence of the Republic itself is in real danger  in order to protect the Constitution  you can sideline the Constitution in order to protect it.  I ve already seen people calling for the people that stormed the Capitol to be tried for treason and stripped of their citizenship. I can imagine the next step is  all Trump supporters  followed by  all conservatives.  It won t be hard for them  as they already have their lists made.  See  no. That s the kind of shit that s talked about on the other side of the extreme aisle   republicans are going to start knocking on our doors and if we didn t vote for trump are going to         . And it s bullshit there too. This is why we can t have nice things. Everyone assumes that if someone doesn t agree with them then they are the  other   and the other wants only one thing   your blood. So we have to destroy or be destroyed and that s exactly how that conversation starts right here. And it s just not fucking true.   Horseshoe theory.  Extremes on both sides are ridiculous and alike but represent only the minority.  They are just loud.  Unfortunately  the rest of us that to conflate those loud people on either side as representing the whole and it  39 s just so far from the truth.  Sucks that we have all been dragged into the poop flinging.  It helps to remember that many on the other side see only the most extreme of your own and are  rightfully  terrified.  Which leads them to taking extreme pre emptive action against them.  This of course makes THEM look evil crazy to the average Joe on your side because you never saw the crazy shit the people on the extreme end of your side said or did.  This constantly talking over each others heads has lead to both sides feeling like the victim and the other side looking crazy for claiming to be a victim.  Exactly. Please keep explaining this because more people need to hear it. I see so much of this and social media exacerbates it. Plus when you feel threatened and attacked by crazies  your natural reaction is to fight back to save yourself and save the country. Meanwhile people outside the US  both those who wish us well and those who don t  just look at us and shake their heads in amazement.  That  39 s not good news...  we aren  39 t a virtuous nor moral society  It all starts with the individual  I m going to do better.  I  39 ve probably read more on that topic than 99  of the population and that includes this sub. Then again  I have a bit of a leg up because of what I do for a living. That said  while I do believe the constitution to be a beautiful and deceptively well put together document  it still relies on the integrity and character of those putting it into practice. It  39 s also intentionally written in a way to be somewhat flexible thus allowing for competing interpretations.   Well  now instead of swords and guns we have weapons that can destroy the planet with a press of a button. So  not looking good if we can t come back.   removed   Cool. I was hoping for total societal upheaval and to lose all I  39 ve worked to hard for. As long as I get to see the country I love burn to the ground  it  39 ll all be worth it  SIGH. I couldn  39 t possibly be more sad right now.  You and me both friend. I wish you and yours the best during this prosperous time.  I  39 m not technically a historian  but I am a big history person  and...well...it ain  39 t looking good fam  Germany eventually came back to freedom...  Watching Germany deal with covid this year  i disagree. I don t know about their free speech laws... I feel that the USA is unique in its absolute and express commitment to free speech and I think losing it would be a loss for the globe.  Yeah  I wouldn  39 t call them   39 free  39  anymore. IIRC  they did pretty good for a while after the Berlin Wall came down.  Germany lost a war  the German state was dismantled  country occupied and new constitution and governmental structure setup in guidance and approval of the occupying forces.  The left is asking the same question while watching the right become Nazis in everything but name.  I miss living in a Republic.  It was nice.  So did the Romans. Don  39 t be fooled  at this current trajectory we  39 re going down the same exact path.  Yep. This is basically some combination of Rome around 100 BC   30 BC  Russia around 1915  and Germany around 1920   1935. You could probably sprinkle in some of what happened in some of the Central and South American authoritarian regimes but those worked a little more on outright force.  Those are three pretty bad times  yo. Not cool.  It  39 s honestly quite terrifying.  But this new place we re in has so many bananas   They generally only last a few centuries  see Rome.  Makes you think Jefferson was either warning or being prophetic when he made that statement about the tree of liberty.  But it s a democracy   s  You know what is more scary than what s happening now   It s what liberals are saying  em SHOULD  em  happen.  I saw a post about the DC mayor asking for permits to be denied for protests around the Inauguration  and made a comment that the March for Life is around that time and people should be aware that it has nothing to do with Trump Biden directly so don  39 t confuse the marchers with Trump supporters and get confrontational  Nick Sandman  anyone  . The reply was  quot Toxic religious groups should go the way of Trump and his seditious mob. quot   It begins with this. Then people s voting history will be checked. Those who voted Trump or republican will get fired. That s just the first step. I ve seen it happen in my birth country  lol  the last thing they want for us to be able to do is to be able to trace every single ballot back to who cast it.  Lol like theyd let us have access to the database.  Let me make this crystal clear for those who need to know .. TRUMP           It s not about you having a database. It s about snitches. People can easily find out who most other people vote for after talking to them or their close confidants. I know people in my old neighbourhood in the old country who keep a list of their own of who they voted for  and they report their lists to the ruling party  mind you  in a multi party  democracy  .   That  39 s so sad. I  39 m glad you made it out and I hope things will turn out differently over here.  Thank you. That was years ago and I m fine now  it s just sad to see the communist revolution turning violent in America  You right.  Out of curiosity  where are you from  From my exposure to global politics this feels like post Soviet Russia. Were basically allowing corporations to dictate what party is on the right side of history and allowing members of that party to do horrible things in the name of progress. Which all just ends with having a defacto ruling class selected by the wealthy elites. Basically an oligarchy. I mean  the parallels between Putin and Biden are there. He usues government to enrich his family in private markets which the exert political influence.  I m from the former Yugoslavia  more specifically Montenegro  and I m also Canadian. In the former Yugoslavia things like this happened under the brutal socialist regime of Tito. I know the history well and everything I see happening in America looks like one big communist revolution that is quickly turning violent. Praying for America     This  I remember calls to end the secret ballot in the 2016 election as a means to pressure people to vote  quot the right way quot  and  quot hold them accountable quot . The authoritarians aren  39 t going to stop trying that now.  Even if ballots are kept secret  snitch lines will become all the more prevalent. Regular people will be doing the party s bidding by snitching on their friends  neighbours and even their own family. I personally know people in my home country who have done this for their ruling party  that s been in power since 1991 in a  democratic  country .  It s already happening. Cops are raiding people for gathering of more than six  based on  tips  from neighbors.   Yes  for covid. It will happen for voting and political leaning too  trust me  People have already been harassed for donating to trump and finding out what political party they re registered to. You can t see their votes but people assume anyways and that s enough to get them harassed and fired.  Wait until Google uses its camera cars to identify Trump signs in peoples yards while Amazon uses its delivery vehicles and drones to do the same. I wish I was joking.  Or until your credit cards start cancelling you because at some point you purchased a firearm ammo  donated to a republican  donated to the NRA  etc.  Geez  this is scary.  We can  39 t buy enough ammo at this point.  Don t listen to that comment  that is not real  The thing is  hopefully at least a small majority of people in government and businesses will realise that doing something like this will bring the wrath of about half the country. If businesses start firing people for their political affiliations and not work ethic or some other reason  then it would bring about tidal waves of lawsuits  as well as boycotts  meaning these businesses will lose half the country as potential customers  leading to a large loss of revenue. Same thing with government  a massive tidal wave of lawsuits  or worse if a large group of people are fed up. Doing anything like this would basically be shooting themselves in the foot.  Yup. This is the next steps. They will do a real audit and find all the trump voters and round um up   deleted   I  39 m fairly certain we  39 d still have some conservatives wringing their hands about optics and looking proper while they come to round us up lmao.  You  39 re absolutely right about that  and that  39 s scary.  Do 2 Trump votes cancel each other out   If this happens  they will be messing with half the country. I am an outsider looking in as well. I am deeply saddened by what has happened in the last year. These are dark days  but my fear is the days will grow darker. I  39 ve never felt a push in my own spirit like I do now to get away from the town in which I now live. I feel like just getting away from it all and creating a bit of shelter and a life for my kids.  I ve been thinking of going up north  past Timmins and living off the grid too lol crazy world we live in  We have a place in mind as well. 30 acres and then thousands of acres of crown land on 3 sides...   ..  Where r u from   Former Yugoslavia  Hahahahahahaha.  Soviet Pravda news likes your comment.  Insert Obama awarding Obama a Medal meme here.  Darn  how do I boycott a site whose content I stopped respecting years ago    deleted    removed    strong  em That is what the Left wants.  em   strong   And beat a cop to death with a flag  You  39 re right  appeasement and forgiveness without apologies is probably best for everyone.  Don  39 t do  em thing  em   or the terrorists will strike again.  Out of control  I  39 ve been less impressed with Forbes lately. They  39 re pandering to different groups and it seems political.  For all the moderates and the liberals   Only difference is we are the largest gun culture on the planet. It  39 s easy to bully and suppress the weak and defenseless.  Wtf are my guns going to do if they go after my means of making a living and supporting my family   That is correct. They are not coming for conservatives through violence  per se.   You should have thought about that before being a fascist  says the party of unity  It s been a decade of projection hasn t it.  Here they have barely grabbed power  even losing their margin in the house and the first thing they do is go full fucking fascist.  Yet Donny was given the perfect opportunity to do anything remotely fascist and the fucker decides  I m letting the states deal with this . He had the biggest opportunity for a power grab with this pandemic and nothing came of it. It s been nothing but projection.  100   Says the actual fascists  ftfy  I think  party of unity  has more of a sting to it as far as insults go. Very ironic  very bittersweet  This is the issue   the weak point for a gun toting culture  as with most conservatives  is the ability to provide  the ability to maintain fiscal independence. It s why I ve thought for a while it will be the conservatives who start the shooting   it ll be someone who lost their job and got publicly shamed in the town square for having the temerity to vote for Trump. It s the point where people have nothing to lose or don t think they have anything to lose or feel they ve been pushed into a corner. We re seeing more of those people spring up and this week s events are probably going to create more.  Not that it needs to be said here  but people need to pay very close attention to any proposed gun laws regulations restrictions etc.  because the left knows they won  39 t be able to come straight out and repeal the second amendment. Instead they will try to weaken it to the point that it  39 s too much of a burden  taxes  regulations  felony charges for defending your home family  etc.  to own a gun.  I think you are right.  They  39 ll probably focus more on certain areas of the US where there are more conservatives. I think a preview was when the mayor of Chicago blamed the governor of Mississippi for the gun deaths in Chicago.  Think about it  how can you dare to compare this to the Holocaust Nazi regime.  For all the moderates and liberals  China and the Pentagon   Military Industrial Complex have more power and pull with these companies than you ever will.  WE WILL HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE   removed   They want that to happen. It will just give them more justification to pass more legislation for  quot everyone  39 s safety quot .    39 Merica.  Fuck yea   So Forbes isn t interested in actually finding the truth...got it   quot Hello  my name is Joe McCarthy and I  39 d like to introduce you to some of our latest stories here at Forbes. quot   It s almost like they re trying to make people violent.  The gulag is always an option comrade.  Isn t the left wing media lying to the public everyday  Lmao. Jesus Christ.  The left continues to lose its mind.  Authouritarian bullshit at its finest.  Who gives a shit what Forbes thinks  Could you image if they did this for all politicians and their sycophants  Congress would surely enact a law making it illegal.  Works both ways.... we should all assume most media sources  I believe forbes  as well  are liars  since  you know.... they lied for years about trump.  Has someone started compiling a list of these blacklist writing bullies yet   I used to like Forbes. They  39 ve gone very far left the last 6 years.  Forbes forcefully endorsed Mitt Romney  all you need to know.  It  39 s like these people want an insurrection  My my  well if it isn  39 t the consequences of my actions...  So private companies excersising their right to choose customers...What should be done  We don  39 t want government controlling how businesses operate or do we   I mean this is the answer even if we don t like the result. Forbes can do whatever it wants.  Yeah this is sure to calm everyone down.  Post like these are a waste. Can we think for a second   We need to realize that trump destroyed our party. Not the dems  liberals  BLM  no  trump destroyed it. And all we can talk about is how it s going to be hard for trumps BFFs to get jobs. How about we focus on the senate in 2022   Making sure Georgia doesn t turn blue again   Let s get up  brush ourselves off and run a slightly  less trump  direction  It feels like we  39 re about 2 or 3 steps away from any Trump supporters being put into camps where they are tortured or killed.  Some really disturbing rhetoric flying around right now.  We may very well be witnessing the fall of America as a super power.  You think prejudice in getting a job is about 2 3 steps away from concentration camps and torture  Sweet jesus  get a grip.  Remember there is no section 230 for wastes of paper like Forbes.  It s funny how  a href   r conservative  rel  nofollow  r conservative  a  is complaining about Twitter banning trump  but yet they have all their posts tagged  flaired only   basically banning anyone from talking.  man this is major deja vu here... It  39 s almost like History is constantly repeating itself or something.  Remember when people thought Forbes was a libertarian outlet

t3_kuqlkp,Pope Francis Spoke Out Against the Mob in DC in His Homily Today  Only One Month Ago He Praised BLM and the George Floyd Protests,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuqlkp/pope_francis_spoke_out_against_the_mob_in_dc_in/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  https   discord.gg conservative  a   Benedict shouldn t have stepped down.  Well at least he isn  39 t covering for pedophiles.. oh wait..  I m getting so tired of this. As a Catholic and a conservative  I think I speak for a lot of us that we are increasingly alienated from conservatives when the first comment is always  PeDoPhiLe PrIeST har har  or  whore of Babylon    There is no more rampant pedophilia in the Church than there is from teachers.  Less  I think.  there  39 s a ton of evidence showing that the current pope has his position because of the wing that  quot cares about the children quot  in the way that law enforcement frowns upon.  Ok. Now prove your claim.  He said theirs a ton of evidence. What more do you want     S   I have many Roman Catholic friends who can t stand this pope or Vatican II. They re part of the  Great Reset  machine and it s becoming more and more obvious  I really think there  39 s going to be another schism where Catholicism breaks into two branches   traditional and reform.  i prefer reform and liberal  but so it goes.  I have no interest in the latin mass but I  39 d appreciate a pope that doesn  39 t condone violent city burning riots  I didn  39 t have an interest in it either  but my wife became interested in TLM and our Parish has been offering one for more than a decade  so we started attending.  I  39 m a Catholic and have been planning on attending a TLM after covid. Quick couple of questions  if you don  39 t mind  do women truly need to veil for the Mass  Also does it need to be a lace veil or is starting with a scarf ok the first time I go   Many of the women do veil  my wife and daughter included  but I don  39 t believe it  39 s a requirement to veil  at least not at any of the Parishes I  39 ve attended the TLM at.  Thanks very much   A lot of us are fed up with Francis trying to claim the moral high ground while allowing corruption within the church to continue. Many  myself including  choose to ignore what this pope has to say since he clearly does not care for everyone  rather he only cares for people who think like the Marxist he is.  He has said such things as atheists could go to heaven  which were head scratchers  given his denomination.  He  39 s said a lot of outright heretical bullshit.  Im an atheist. I think the bible makes it perfectly clear where i would go. That  39 s a strange thing for a pope to say. Its not like im tempted to go to a Catholic church now  and it wouldn  39 t offend me  or make any difference  if he just stuck to what the book says and the believers believe. Very odd.  I could see someone who believes in God in general thinking it  but yeah based on his specific religion is what is confusing about his statement.  The book clearly says that hypothetically i would be going to hell. It wouldn  39 t offend me in the slightest if he just said that  nor would it scare me. Seems like he  39 s selling out for people that arent going to contribute to the church anyway.  And that is just one example of what he has said. He  39 s said some odd things.  I strongly dislike him. I don t know how he got chosen but I do not think he properly represents the values of the church.  I can attest  as a Catholic I don t like this Pope.  Roman Catholic here.  You just can t have what should be the spiritual leader of a billion people dropping in with hot takes on specific partisan issues like a Sociology student with their first Twitter account.  Yes.  Not sure how this guy was compromised.  They probably have his laptop as well.  He was a Marxist to begin with.  Blackmail seems unnecessary.  This commie asshole is NOT the favorite pope of most Catholics I know.  Adding this to the list of reasons I m a Protestant  Its crazy that even the pope was taken over by this wokeology. Where does it end  Bascially every 1st world country is infected by wokeness  Its disheartening to me and i dont even believe in the stuff    Benedict was much better. Forced to resign. Does that remind you of something   Heh. I thought he was supposed to lead people to Christ.  Im a good ole apostate but im pretty sure thats in the job description.  Jorge is OK with the killing of dozens and the injuring of thousands...just as long as his politics are the cause.  We tolerate him  sorta.  There are a  em lot  em  of Catholics who despise him and think he should be excommunicated.  This Pope  39 s more erratic than the Crusader Kings 2 pontiff  He s probably got as much money  gold  too.  Breaking  Another Pedophile enabler sides with leftists.  Evidence of Pope Francis s  pedophile enabling    Anyone who has risen to power in the Catholic Church has enabled pedophiles  and a lot of them.  Anyone who has risen to  power  in the Church has  em enabled  em  pedophiles  Any evidence for that claim   It s Reddit. You can t mention the world  Catholic  or any term remotely involving clergy without this knee jerk response. They re like trained seals with a fish in that regard. Best to let it slide  there s not any level of honest discussion to be had with people like that.  He was probably gaslit by the media  and didn  39 t see how violent the  quot protests quot  were.  I think if you  39 re a thought leader for a large number of people you have a responsibility to find out what  39 s going on before opening your mouth.  So you may be right  but I  39 m not inclined to excuse him if so.  Y all forget how old this dude is. What sort of news and media do you think he gets exposed to  Probably mainstream Italian news  and probably not much because I imagine being Pope is an incredibly time consuming career. He s not surfing the depths of the Internet for reality.  Fair  but I maintain that he shouldn  39 t talk when he doesn  39 t know what he  39 s talking about.  I don  39 t spout off about Italian politics  because I  39 m aware of my ignorance.  100  agree. The Pope in a weird spot right now where Church leadership thinks  modernizing  the church is how we get young people. In reality  embracing tradition is how we get youth but he s constantly pressured by Vatican leadership to speak on these identity politics issues. I hope the next Pope is someone like Cardinal Sarah  Ill weigh in as a non believer that grew up christian. It  39 d be far more appealing if the church stuck to its guns. Seeing a pope have this opinion is disturbing.  My faith and beliefs are catholic but the so called infallible acts of the Pope is horse shit.  Pope is only infallible when speaking  quot ex cathedra  quot  which happens very very rarely. And it  39 s always done on general matters of the religion  usually to clarify something.  Huh  He s not infallible when he speaks on American politics.  Idk how anyone can believe that any man is infallible.  We don t believe that any man is infallible  except for Jesus  but He sort of has the  being God  thing going for Him  too . Papal infallibility as a doctrine is more meant to express that no pope will formally commit heresy to doctrine in the Church. Papal infallibility is probably the most misunderstood doctrine of our faith  and it means WAY less than most people think it does.  Nothing about the doctrine of papal infallibility implies that you must agree with everything a pope says   it merely means that he will not formally make heresy into doctrine.  As a Catholic  I would like to apologize for the Communist shithead that currently has a pointy hat.  The Catholic Church has had plenty of Popes who were not truly virtuous or pious men in the past when shit like the inquisition was torturing Jews into confessions or they were calling for massive invasion forces from all of the Christian kingdoms to fight the Arabs. No reason to think every Pope in the modern era will also be a true Christian. This pope is a globalist pawn it s pretty obvious at this point.  You wanna throw gas on the Q dumpster fire  Have the head of the largest organized child trafficking ring in the world condemn them. This will not help  given the Catholic church s history.  Can we get Benedict back   He stuck with religious matters more than trendy social  liberal  talking points.  Evil in the world today is the same as it was centuries ago  but it is enriched by unwritten rules of the new world  equipped financially and technically  which has unprecedented information and communication possibilities.  Rosenberg is a domestic terrorist   gt   Rosenberg is a board member of BLM   gt   The Pope is in favor of domestic terrorism.  This Pope is a Communist.  Fuck the Pope.  Catholic church is a joke  Of course he stands with the left. Just like the Hollywood and rich Democrat elites  the pope condones raping children.  Is there video of him speaking  Rumors and conspiracy theories keep floating that he was arrested  Those would appear to be completely false if he s been seen giving speeches  Or was this a written statement   He hasn t been arrested. I don t think I ve seen a crazier conspiracy theory environment then today. There s so much crazy shit floating around  it s insane.  Censorship seems to contribute to it   It  39 s coming from the gateway pundit.  Fuck the Pope.  I wonder how Catholics are taking this..  I don  39 t do religion so it  39 s easy for me to just call the dude a shit bird and move on.  Damn. I  39 m atheist and I can  39 t even believe the Pope is saying this. Society is so fucked.  What a piece of shit.   deleted

These people need to be able to be held accountable  Came by to say exactly this.  So  about that picture of Mrs. Pelosi knelling in support of BLM.  Headline should read   Pelosi chokes up when she realizes that the people have all the power  and this country was founded on the blood of aristocracy   She choking up only because she knows that her laptop and all of her incriminating files on it were stolen.  She must have selectively forget the ones who stormed the capitol during the Kavanaugh hearings. Because those looked more violent than what happened on the 6th...

Is this like NBC  39 s  quot undecided quot  voters who had already said they were voting for Biden or even worked for his campaign   The daily caller thinks they balanced but they re just another propaganda outlet.  Lol  last week there was another poll saying his approval went up. Jesus....  Hmmmm...why don t I believe polls anymore  oh that s right.  Polls are commisioned and used for politicians to raise money for campaigns.  He  39 s got my support  So polls are suddenly legitimate again after the last election disaster   This is literal fake news.  Hes polling at record highs.  a href  https   www.rasmussenreports.com public content politics trump administration prez track jan011  https   www.rasmussenreports.com public content politics trump administration prez track jan011  a   But keep pushing your bullshit.  I  39 m not sure eif anything is true anymore  Ah  yes  another one of those polls where they ask questions to a 100 not so random people and somehow that reflects what 300 MILLION think  Lol. I ve seen three different articles today. One says numbers are up. One says numbers are down. And one says numbers are the same. Yet people tell me fake news is all a myth.  Well considering the last few said his numbers were up  I  39 ll just continue disregarding polls since they haven  39 t given me a correct answer or even come close to a correct answer in a long time.  they just can  39 t get any lower  folks  this is the end of Orange Man   Who cares   Polls are nonsense.  No one should trust poling anymore  If you re gonna make me believe either the daily caller or Rasmussen  I think I know which one I m gonna pick. Myself and all the Trump supporters I know still completely support the president.  The left has never been about individual freedom. They have been trying gun confiscation for nearly a century. Hitler  Mussolini  Pinochet  marxists  communists  Maoists  Soviets  they are all leftists. The left has been about power.  My view of the left is definitely starting to evolve as time goes by to see that. I use to see the left as free speech advocates  but it s clear now they only care about that when it benefits them.   It helps them  it supports their world views   Fake News  Polled at Nancy Pelosi  39 s brunch cocktail party.  Ah yes  Quinnipiac. The gold standard of polling.  Lies  damned lies  and statistics. Polls have been outed for many years now as methods of forcing a narrative.  Cmon dude

Oppan Gangnam style  Iran needs a swift kick in the ass. They re getting unruly again.  Unfortunately  with Biden  they  39 ll probably just get more pallets of cash.

I know it  39 s satire  but humor can be right you know.  Article mentions buying all the paper companies so they can  39 t print  which I wouldn  39 t put it past them.  Exactly what I was thinking. Back to pamphlet printing  The number of printing facilities set on fire would hit levels never before seen  and of course the mainstream media would completely ignore it.   quot Green New Deal bars tree harvesting for paper quot   I mean  I d subscribe  and to the downvoting basement dwellers  I realize it s satire   So would I.  It would be a welcome site to see something in my mailbox that wasn  39 t junkmail.  100  I  39 d buy the paper. I tried a few years ago to find physical papers delivered to my door   mailbox. Only the far left local garbage paper still offered delivery. It  39 s really a shame.  The above the fold stories on the mocked up newspaper are sheer brilliance.  Glad people are starting to wake up to the dangers of monopolistic tech giants. At the very least we need anti trust cases against Amazon  Facebook and Alphabet with more teeth than anything we ve seen in the past.  The problem isn  39 t really that they  39 re a monopoly  it  39 s that they  39 re all working directly with one political party to push a political agenda  while suppressing opposition voices . If there are a dozen big social media sites then they can  39 t all be monopolies  but they can come together to use their power for mass propaganda and mass censorship.  Lmao  Wait until the post office says it won  39 t be mailing it  I d pay to get one one in the mail every week.  So glad that the Bee can give us a laugh through these dark and troubling times.  Actually  print should be brought back. Liberals don  39 t like documents. That  39 s why digital is their game...they can erase everything in seconds.  Even though it s satire  I don t think it would be a bad idea to subscribe. We can all use some laughter early in the morning when walking outside.  This is how the postal service will be saved.

The capitol rioters are being treated differently than BLM  they re actually being charged for rioting.  Not to mention that they used tear gas  flash bangs  mace  etc. just on the crowd outside.  Lol yeah what did you think would happen  Any time anyone who politically leans to the right of Mao Zedong does anything  it s automatically painted as a white supremecist uprising.   BLM is literally writing the news in 2021  Communists spreading communist propaganda.   It quotes a number of Black Lives Matter activists who misrepresent the day s events to suggest that the police went easy on the pro Trump rioters because they were predominantly white. ...yeah I m sure it s just because they were predominantly white  probably had nothing to do with the fact that they weren t destroying people s businesses and millions of dollars of property  s  It s the Washington Post.

t3_kv3gj1,Eliminating Trump from being elected again one motivator in impeachment push Pelosi says,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv3gj1/eliminating_trump_from_being_elected_again_one/,I suspect the primary goal is to get Republicans to vote against impeachment. Those doing so will be accused of   quot inciting violence quot  and supporting insurrection.  This is 100  just political theatre. Trump isn  39 t getting impeached less than a week away from the end of his Presidency.  They can still impeach him once he  39 s out of office  then he won  39 t be able to run again ever and they  39 ll have a Democrat majority in the Senate.  It s over a week but yeah  So admitting it  39 s a stunt to stop him from running again should shut down the whole thing  amp  should get her removed instead for such a stunt but she  39 s a Democrat so that  39 s not how this works.  Removed  Leftists will give her an award for silencing the opposition.  She s making a wish  It s not her birthday yet...  This is not going to be an impeachment  this is going to be a trial for treason. They are going to use the storming of the Capitol as an attempt to assassinate the 2nd  3rd and 4th in line to the president. And its to signal Trump JR not to run for President.  Too bad they won t have time to gain traction. Just like a basketball game  the clock is running down fast  Do you remember Obama 1st inauguration  There was a crowd of people chanting  quot Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye quot  to Bush...   Trump Jr is  100 running for president in the future. He has learned a lot from his Father  39 s time in office. He has none of the scandal following him that his father had entering the office. I think he will be all of the good aspects of Trump and none of the bad. Plus  Trump  39 s devoted fan base transition to him versus someone like Ted Cruz. Impeachment or not  with the events over the past four years the Democrats have created a lifelong liberal eating monster out of Trump Jr.  Agree... this is why they are going to impeach Trump and push Treason. They dont want Trump Jr in 2024.  Removal wouldn t preclude Jr from running. Nor would it necessarily impede his popularity.  Agree... but they going to make those that support Trump or those attending at January 6th rally to be criminals.  Honestly  I follow him on social media  and I was very very hesitant about the idea of a Trump dynasty  but  you have a point. He seems like he is more calculated and less of them out loudmouth  in the sense that when he does go off  he is very cautious about the way he does it and the words he uses  whereas I think his father just shoots from the hip without even thinking.  Yes  Nasty  keep acting like 2024 is going to be another legitimate election.  Jerry Nadler pushed for Bill Clinton to pardon Susan Rosenberg who actually bombed the capital building.  Obviously the Dems are OK with violence and terrorism.  This woman should be  and should  39 ve been  impeached.  No she shouldn t. Neither should trump either time. We have to stop this nonsense. It s a waste of time and it makes us look third world and unstable.  No hes right. She broke chain of command to try to get them to strip him of the nuclear launch codes and also gave Pence 24hrs to impeach him. That is clear treason...  She said 24 hours or she will impeach. That s a bitchy ultimatum not treason.   You still can  39 t tell someone who outranks you  Pence  to enable the 25th Amendment. She has no power to do that hence treason...i dont know the actually laws on it but just from being in the Marines you would get so fucked for doing anything even close to this...  Yeah  so she wasn t able to do that. The system worked. You don t have to impeach someone every time they step out of line. You can just slap them down. We have to get our of this mindset. Look at this  she s trying to impeach a dude who is leaving office in a number of HOURS.  Oh I agree but at what point do we use their own game plan against them. She has done enough to be impeached yet nobody would dare to do that to all knowing powerful Nancy...im over these rules for thee but not for me. We need a fucking revolution  We may need a revolution  that s not an unreasonable position.  This isn  39 t why she is doing this.  Agreed.  She doesny want him releasing classified info on her pedo ring or Chinese influence.  Why wouldn t he have already   Wasting more money during a pandemic. Its the democratic way.  Why did Twitter suddenly delete trumps Twitter with 80 million followers  Why is Pelosi suddenly urging in a psychotic way to impeach Trump with 10 days left on his term  Her laptop was stolen during the raid of the Capitol. What does Trump have  It s hard not to go down rabbit holes when every platform is trying to rid of Trump from communicating.   quot You know that process that happens every 4 years where the people select a nominee in a primary and in then vote for their selection in November for President of the United States   Well  screw you  I decide who is and who is not running for president  quot   super democratic  People really support these bully tactics. The behavior of our government officials have been embarassing.  Silencing him before he releases whatever information the left is terrified he will spill is another motivator  I bet.  Yep.  She s scared he d win  Why are the democraps bothering with this now that they know they can steal any election they want.  More BS from Nancy. Who knew that such a tiny woman could hold so much hate   She keeps it in her  24k fridge and refuels nightly.
t3_kunbni,Parler CEO Says Service Dropped By Every Vendor Could End Business,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kunbni/parler_ceo_says_service_dropped_by_every_vendor/,He should take the servers to Israel  They should take it to Sealand  Or Poland.  Israel is not pro conservative. Please do not be fooled  Am Israeli  the elites here are very pro Democrat but the people overwhelmingly pro Trump. Even according to left leaning polls.   Oh boy looks like we re heading for another time period with corporations running the country with no subtlety. Big Tech is every bit as bad as oil companies were back in the day.  Can you elaborate   Before the whole anti trust hammer came down for a while politics in the US were under sway of powerful corporations from the oil and railroad industries. There were probably more but to my knowledge they were the biggest. Anyway due to their bribery and  donations  to politicians in Congress these corporations controlled American politics.  Gotcha. Thanks for explaining.  Sounds like the issue is with government power instead of corporate power  The root of the problem is definitely government corruption but the powerful corporations still need to be dealt with.   Don  39 t be weak. Get your own servers asap.  It  39 s not anywhere near that simple.  Banking is next.  Watching these big tech companies which control the vast majority of internet space work in concert to deny financial and infrastructure that is available to everyone else  isn  39 t something to sit back and pass off as working as intended.  It  39 s a classic.  a href  https   en.wikipedia.org wiki Corporatism  A popular slogan of the Italian Fascists under Mussolini was  quot Tutto nello Stato  niente al di fuori dello Stato  nulla contro lo Stato quot    quot everything for the state  nothing outside the state  nothing against the state quot  .  a   You  39 re 100  correct  but we have to start somewhere and now or we  39 ll be swamped.  If again  they do that T3 carriers  ISP for corporations  can just deny them access. And ICANN  the worlds DNS registrar  or simply the group that manages the translation from  a href  https   reddit.com  reddit.com  a  to an IP address  and IP address manager  can also deny them that too.   If ICANN starts playing politics  hell froze over  Unironically  if ICANN started playing politics  I think we would be at the point of a real NWO situation as crazy as it seems. At that point ICANN could reject all request unless they  quot known quot  that their narrative would be met  shutdown sites at a whim  or say for example  tell reddit to remove this very sub or loose its IP and DNS name .  Luckily the internet is open and flexible enough where that level of censorship could have it  39 s face shoved in the mud. Anyone can write a new network protocol and make it accessable to the general public just like any other web browser.  Yay technofascism   What if no company will sell them the servers   Any computer can be a server. It  39 s that they want to rent server space from a provider. They could  if they have the technical staff  set up their own servers and host from their own network.  Yes  but they would need a ton  it would take a long time to get them  and companies may not sell them the servers. They  39 re not going to go to best buy to pick them up.  Again  you don  39 t have to  quot buy servers quot  from a specific company. You could go to Newegg or Micro Center or Amazon or eBay and start buying parts. Heck  you can probably get decommissioned servers on eBay at a pretty reasonable price.  not that simple or fast  Remember when EVERYONE told Trump he couldn  39 t get a Covid vaccine in under 5 years...  Yes and China Joe biden is gonna claim all credit     watch.  Would be hilarious if the left kept pushing censorship until farmers and truck drivers said  quot fuck it  we  39 re not delivering to the cities any more quot   expect seizings then in   39 the emergency  39   We are on that path  or at least balkanization.  I mean they can seize them  but can they force them to work  I know the 13th amendment dose allow for involuntary as an punishment  but not because  quot they wont work. quot  Your not breaking the law by not working  unless some crazy laws say otherwise.  they can coerce  and DONT expect in the end for these enemies to respect ANY of the Constitution    I started a new stock watch list  I have insta  face book  apple and  Amazon it s the weekend but I did play some puts because I think they will all drop  Amazon can take the hit they are extremely diverse. I would not gamble against them  at least not betting for much more than a couple point drop.   If I m a company looking at AWS for my entire backend  this type of move makes me very queasy. The thought that internal external politics renders my infrastructure vendor a single point of failure will give many technology execs flop sweats.   to be fair  they all just demonstrated the ability to co ordinate with each other to put their competition out of business. that  39 s a pretty chilling and powerful message  much like the democrat majorities endorsing this assault on free speech.  Puts on apple is a pretty good way to lose money. I d do it on Twitter though  To be fair  Apple up to this point hasn t told half the country they don t want their business. Has apple actually innovated in any meaningful way since losing Steve Jobs    I feel the same way  but it s pretty undeniable right now that iOS is more secure than Android. I don t care for google either. I m hoping Microsoft steps up to the plate and releases a competitive phone with secure software.  twitter is the only one i see suffering permanent damage from this.  Apple announced a new deal over the weekend in the run up to earnings. People are going to try to push this stock up before earnings. This news alone could also push apple up as well.  Is there anything that WE can do to assist Parler   What s being done to this company is scummy.  Google  Apple  Amazon  every other web hosting service  every other text message service  every other email service  all their lawyers  all ditched them  That s some deep collusion all being done to kill a Twitter competitor...  You can sideload the app on Android. Problem is if they can  39 t get the server space.  Don  39 t forget   what was that bugbunny saying  quot This means  W.... quot   is there any way to save it  this is the beginning of the end of our country   removed   The progressives are going to be quite surprised when the authoritarians set their sights on them.  I didn t realize Burn Loot Murder and Antifa were big on Parler   removed   Mods gotta stop just giving out flair to idiots like this.  His flair was something like  durp  I think they gave it to him as an insult.  If they have the legal protections of a platform they have the legal responsibility of a platform. A platform is free speech
t3_kut347,Storming of the Capitol was stupid but Democrats flaming hypocrisy is outrageous,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kut347/storming_of_the_capitol_was_stupid_but_democrats/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  https   discord.gg conservative  a   Small businesses and low income housing projects were set on fire over the summer and democrats didn t care  but now that THEY were the target of a riot suddenly it s the end of the world  According to Democrats  it was  worse than 9 11    They re kings and queens and some peasants defiled their DC Temple.  That is exactly why they are so bitter about it. They want to believe they are untouchable.   quot The world will know that free men stood against a tyrant  that few stood against many  and before this battle was over  even a god king can bleed. quot   I can t remember who  but some Congress critter gave an interview and referred to the Capitol building as  sacred ground  as if it were a holy site where people should worship them.  In a secular world it basically is their sacred ground.  Oh gods on Capital Hill  please have mercy on me with  600 after locking me inside for months.   I guess it makes sense when you look at it through the lens of worshiping government like it s a divine being sent to save humanity  that makes sense. Lol I always just kinda viewed our reps as employees of the American people.  I m becoming convinced that left wing and right wing people just see their relationship with government in diametrically opposed ways.  These same people were calling Mount Rushmore a  quot monument to white supremacy quot  a few months ago.   Which is funny because it wasn t even as bad as June 2020 when Democrats caused over  15M in damages  fires  etc from the riots.  I think the total will was 2bn . A few days ago was very stupid. All summer fall long was targeting hard working Americans with politicians backing the destruction.   Or the white house riot where 50 secret service agents were injured  monuments were burned  and Trump was forced into the bunker there. Not a single Democrat or media personality condemned that riot. Which was worse by far than the Capitol breach.  Yuuuup   It is sickening the hypocrisy.  It s why I really like the article.  I love how they were also saying how we need to defund the police all last year. Then  come Wednesday  they couldn  39 t stop saying   quot We need more police action  quot   Nope. Because the lie was too widespread that too many people believed it.  even then  THE cops told the stupid mother fucker to get down  the fucker was going into his car... what were they suppose to do  Be like a movie and stand there until whatever happened afterwards happened   Less than ONE DAY of protests that showed up on their doorstep. That s how long it took them to bust out the live rounds. That s how much they care about themselves vs how much they care about us.  I especially love the hypocrisy about cops. First they say all cops are bad  then a cop gets killed and they are mourning a hero  Lmao they have zero values  I also saw some of my leftist friends who were crying during the George Floyd riots things like  you re a terrible human being if you comment about property being hurt but not a live being lost    were celebrating and making fun of the death of that woman at the Capitol.  That  39 s where put screenshots side by side and post it as a comment. And if they delete it  post it on your own page.  They are the results of losing all of your moral compass.  Yea these things aren t mutually exclusive lol  I just wish the word  coup  would stop being used. These drunk dudebros had no plan after getting in. A coup suggest they planned on replacing elected officials.  They could call it a Capital Hill Occupation Protest  Those are totally legit  Suddenly it seems that it is no longer trendy to  Occupy important places  huh   It  39 s called a  quot sit in quot  when Democrats do it.   a href  https   thehill.com homenews senate 409999 scores of kavanaugh protesters arrested after descending on senate building  It was only two years ago...  a   Correct.  A coup doesn t involve police opening doors and helping people up the stairs.    I ve been seeing this comment about the cops letting them in a lot but haven t seen it myself. Do you have a link   This is the best video I  39 ve seen  a href  https   twitter.com christina bobb status 1347596278583197698 s 19  https   twitter.com christina bobb status 1347596278583197698 s 19  a   ....by being elected president  Is there something I  39 m not seeing   Kek...  elected  if you ignore video proof of ballot harvesting  statistical anomalies that have never happened in election history  that biden is most voted for President in history though he scored low on Democratic confidence  oh and thousands of pages of affidavits from hundreds of poll watchers.  All while not a single audit was done to prove the legitimacy of the election.  Ironically  Democrats had 0.001  of the data and spent 10 months trying to impeach trump off of ONE whistleblower who had direct ties to Democratic Party  was never asked to do anything and had no repercussions when it was found out it was a farce.  Ahh  I see. The pendulum will swing back  it always does.  A sitting president of the United States using a couple of unarmed supporters that everyone knew would be protesting in this location to stage the coup.   Pelosi literally came closer to attempting a real coup than they did.  Sounds like projection on Nancy s part.    a href  https   youtu.be j2TUNlvJpo0  https   youtu.be j2TUNlvJpo0  a   Projection is all democrats know  Storming the Capital building was a pretty stupid move. Doesn t really compare to the last 6 months of BLM Biden supporter violence rioting looting though does it  I m from the UK and even I can see the blaring double standards   This is a textbook example of exploiting a tragedy for your own purposes...and the media is gleefully playing along.  Liberals are a lost cause.  Don  39 t say that. Maybe the elected Democrats are  since they  39 re so power hungry  but with the right attitude and the right presentation  we can sway the Democrat voters.  And stunningly  without hesitation  the lemmings follow along.  It  39 s interesting that Biden said  quot had it been BLM that stormed the capital things would have been handled much differently quot  like it wouldn  39 t have absolutely been downplayed and justified. They would have called it a  quot mostly peaceful storming of the capital quot  and still found a way to blame the right for it.  I just don t understand how people are arguing the police went easy on them because they re white  despite the fact that 4 people were killed in a single day. Can you name a single one of the BLM riots with that level of force used  People just believe anything because of a couple pictures the media pushes where there wasn t tear gas.  And a black man shot an unarmed white woman.  em crickets  em . Reverse that role and see what happens.  Police went easy on them in most cases because the protesters were being polite and non violent.  BLM should try it some time.  The hypocrisy is mind numbing but their overdramatized opinions on it are just insanity  Glad this was put in the Washington Times.  The hypocrisy is maddening to myself and so many of you   The media forgets how politicians like AOC  Pelosi  Harris were APPLAUDING crazy left wing activists when they stormed the Senate building to protest.  Why were the left politicians not criminalized like the Right now is   How is this different   Based on video  police opened the doors for the protestors.  The woman who sadly lost her life was murdered by a trigger happy cop.  The left has done so much worse and we have to stand against these people because they are allowing themselves different standards.  NONE of it is right.  Americans should disagree at the ballot box.  But when conservatives are being targeted by Judenrats who are trying to turn Trump supporters in for crime of being conservative   This cannot be allowed   Being political opposites is NOT a crime.  Wow that comment took a disappointing turn at the end    Never saw it before. Seems to be referring to an organization used to opresss the Jews in the ghettos. Quite the hyperbole  but not really offensive.   removed   Pretty much the OP is putting conservatives in the place of the Jews in terms of persecution. I guess you could say this down plays their hardship with the hyperbole. At the same time Biden and Democrats run around using terms like slavery and racism as if it was going out of style. And that 100  down plays those actually horrific events. But in this case the poster seems intentionally being hyperbolic as a form of emotion.  Thanks for the correction.

I still believe there s truth to this but not quite in the way Maria Zack told it  Has anybody actually seen read this supposed affidavit   Yeah     Care to elaborate  So far I have only seen accusations based off of an affidavit that nobody has actually seen.

That  39 s like a robber being mugged and selectively forgetting they robbed a gas station 8 months earlier. In other words  they remember it vividly  that  39 s why they accuse others of the crimes they have already comitted.  Are they still there today causing a panic  No. Was it unfortunate  Yes.

I mean...why  The NRA is a dog whistle for liberals  go after the NRA  FOC and GOA are getting the work done.  Biden doesn  39 t like his rape victims to be armed.  Hey  remember when Biden was credibly accused of sexual assault and the media covered it up  Good times.  Well  you can t carry a gun if you are under 18  so Biden is probably safe anyway.  That  39 s gonna be a yikes from me dog.  I remember when his VP said she believed his accuser  too.  I agree with you but like it or not the NRA is the face of gun owners.  They ve sold us out time and time again but they still have the money  resources  and connections that the FOC and GOA could only dream of.  However the NRA goes  goes the rest of these fun lobbyist groups and then gun owners rights.  I read it as NBA and I was kinda okay with it.  Cool  now do the NAACP.  It  39 s gonna be a weird four years.  Just fire a double barrel shotgun into the air  Joe.  Get a shotgun   Two blasts    epic...   quot Defeat  quot  Like in battle  He  39 s inciting violence  Impeach    Well  I got news for ya gun manufacturers  I m coming for you and I m gonna take you down.   Yeah this reminds me of the argument libs say about AR  39 s not being around at the time the 2A was written in the bill of rights. Yeah well  my counter argument to that is we didn  39 t have tanks  aircraft carriers or thermonuclear weapons then either. So I  39 m pretty sure an AR is pretty non threatening compared to those things....  When the 2A was written  the populace was well armed and the state was not.  It was meant to stay that way.  Do I should go out and buy a tank and a rocket launcher      Hey I ll drive   Yes.  Corn pop is in hiding  Just send them to  quot re education camps quot   Joe. It worked well for Stalin.  Defeat the NRA  In what  a pushup contest   Uncle Joe and Cornpop are teaming up finally. They re challenging all comers to a diving contest.

Remember when they released videos of people collapsing in the streets  foaming at the mouth because they died of Covid  Then videos of people in full body suits with masks on spraying down the streets with some sort of liquid  I do. China is assho liars   I do remember that and now I m wondering what they were trying to achieve with those videos. I had thought those were leaked videos but if China purposefully released them  what was their propaganda angle   Probably to get the US scared and shut down so the economy is crippled  to make it look like it was Trump  39 s fault. Insurance to make him look bad so no one votes for him  in case their stealing of votes wasn  39 t enough.  Fear was their intention. They wanted everyone to stay indoors while they contained the outbreak. Tbf they did seem to get it under control quickly though obviously their numbers are bs. Even so their heavy handed approach was maybe the best plan.  Too late now. Maybe the media and rest of the world should  39 ve been more honest for the past  idk  9 months  and actually given a shit about investigating China.  Come on  man  They got their covid death rate down to 5 deaths per day within like a week and had it under control better than President Trump  How dare you question us for believing anything the Chinese propagandists say   The media  probably  China says  OwO senpai Fauci   enter me daddy   Fucking crazy how that happens RIGHT after Beijing Biden is set to take office

If there is nothing to the cases  then get that on the record. Suspicious how they don  39 t want to let any of these cases have a even five seconds in a courtroom.  You are too kind when you say   suspicious .

Even if they did every platform would take it down  She called him and others  quot enemies of the state. quot  She has done far worse than she claims of others.  It doesn t even matter who says it anymore. As long as you say it first or say it louder  you are the more credible one in the room. And Trump s been on the defense for most of his presidential career.  The enemy have us surrounded   they won t get away this time    Chesty Puller  Says the woman who is visibly drunk by 10am most days.  This makes me wonder what Pelosi is afraid of.  It seems weird that she won  39 t just wait until he is gone.  It makes me think that Trump has one last card to play... and I don  39 t mean activating the military with the insurrection act.  I mean... if he did that  it wouldn  39 t be that surprising at this point  but it  39 s risky and doesn  39 t seem likely.

These situations are simply a powder keg. It  39 s near impossible under these circumstances for there to be zero violence.

When the GOP held the senate and the house  they were more interested in passing a bump stocks ban than helping right the balance of market power in tech.

Over 25 services shunned them  so they have slowly built everything they need to operate.  I just switched over to Gab. So far the UI is 100  better  Smart move.  What s gab   Another alternate social media website  also free speech  and is somewhat a mix between twitter and reddit  Gab is legit  Proof that you really need an entire independent supply chain to be a free speech platform  how does brave stack up against duckduckgo   brave is a web browser  ah  i see now. thanks for clarification  I  39 ve never seen such cowardice become so popular so fast.  The Capitol unrest was our Reichstag fire.   more of a Reichstag  quot someone left the stove on and burnt the pizza but let  39 s just say the whole building went up in flames quot   The morons who stormed the capitol are not conservatives  stop associating with and defending them.

Yea this really looks like that mate   a href  https   youtu.be cwTlxKjiW5g  https   youtu.be cwTlxKjiW5g  a    Are you implying they didn  39 t  Ohhhhh lookie here  I can share video too  Let me guess  dEePfAkE vIdEo      You actually are. You are stating one fact  the one you want to use to bolster your argument  and are using that to disregard another fact or set of facts that counter your argument.   I literally showed you video from the capitol. Two videos. How am I lying  I  39 ve nothing to do with Q  but you sure sound like a leftist  deny facts and all.  indeed ... though more like the Reichstag cracked window and people wandering around aimlessly moment.  This is going to be difficult but it will get done. Even if Parler builds its own data centers the ISPs will throttle traffic to from it. 2021 is going to be a long year for true conservatives. The task of building every digital asset from scratch for conservatives is truly daunting. Better to focus on the task at hand and not look too far ahead.  Too bad we dont have net neutrality anymore. But at that point they would just deny connection entirely.  Makes you think  liberals hunting down Trump supporters is like the nazis hunting down Jews.  Except the Trump supporters have guns  Sounds like he needs an elite crack team for the job. He should call Rudy Guiliani  Next  they  39 ll try to fire every non leftist from their jobs.  These lefist motherfuckers are playing hardball.  Thank God I work for a conservative company in a conservative  salt of the earth industry.  If the leftists want to cut us out good fucking luck to them because we  39 re the plumbers that ensure you have water  sewer and sump pump systems.  I  39 m a manufacturers rep and my customers are the plumbers in my region.  All of them.  Can  39 t think of a single one who  39 s far left.  I  39 d give you an award  but you LITERALLY just paid yourself.  Well done sir  if your ever in clarksville  ill buy you a beer.  Wait  are you just monkeying around  Or just trying to be friendly    quot Look  the people you are after are the people you depend on. We cook your meals  we haul your trash  we connect your calls  we drive your ambulances  we guard you while you sleep quot   I  39 d think they may also run into issues when farmers decide to not grow food for them. They want to play hardball. Let  39 s play hardball.  I know what to say when they complain.  quot Dont like it  Start your own agriculture industry. quot   I  39 d love to see the look on a marxists face when the farmers play that game  We all saw their  quot garden quot  in chaz with the mentally unstable  quot farmer quot  rolling around in the mud.  I was absolutely convinced those pictures were photoshopped or shitposting... Nope  they are THAT stupid.  Guess I should expect to have my head on the chopping block soon for having a flag displayed behind me during business calls.  I expect every business in America will fall bc lefties don  39 t have jobs.  Imagine thinking half the country is unemployed  if i lose my shitposting job this country is officially over  Is this really surprising anyone  The left has been sending us crystal clear messages for the last 6 or so year that the second they had control they would try to wipe us out. Coexistence hasn  39 t been an option for a while. They dont want unity they want submission. So either submit or fight  Exactly. I don  39 t understand how anyone could not have seen what was coming. This is a communist takeover that  39 s been in the works for over 60 years  theyve just quit hiding it in the last decade. These are the same syphilis ridden radicals from the 60  39 s that have taken over all of the modern cultural institutions.   4 years of revenge governance incoming.  THIS is what fascism looks like  Fascism comes from the state. This is definitely collusion  violation of natural rights  and blatant bigotry.  Fascism was and IS an agreement between the state and private industry. This IS fascism. They  39 re getting all their queues from the political leaders of the new regime and they  39 re sycophantically dutiful.  Fascism was massive regulations to exert control over corporations. Businesses had no real choice  though I  39 m sure some were eager. In Italy a number of corporations were put under the control of their version of unions.  Fascism is when the state and corporations collude  Fascism uses extreme regulations to control corporations. For instance when Obama appointed a Car Czar to take over GM and give the auto workers union a controlling share of the company is an example of Fascism.  When conservative companies start challenging the monopolies the left will finally move to have government step in and shut them down.  That is the essential model of corporatist Fascism. Coordination of business efforts with the government who serves as an agent against competition. One hand washes the other.  I agree but they re hiding behind  private company  They can do what they want . If we start to challenge that with free enterprise the government will overtly step in   deleted   That is a fight fire with fire type attitude. The left are bigots  I don  39 t condone more bigotry as the answer. But it does seem like the elites are fully mobilized to attack conservatives.  Defense comes in many forms. The enemy has attacked.  CCP going all out  Weird that this comment was hidden..  it  39 s  quot controversial quot   Would be a shame if Xinnie the pooh got his feelers hurt. Whatever you do dont bring up the concentration camps  Oh  and DEFINITELY dont bring up the forced sterilization and organ harvesting   that  39 s what the left has planned for us down the road. it  39 s all the same ideology.  Im am avid china watcher. Really like chinese dissident channels. Been interested for a few years. Its surreal seeing our media use the same tactics ive seen the ccp use.  the difference here if course is that we  39 re going to win.  Im going to love watching the market self correct  The economic migration is epic already.  imagine unleashing the US  39  full potential after 6 decades of slumber.  He definitely exposed just how corrupt washington is. Shocking how depraved these people are.  They need to move their severs to Poland.  This going to be a rough few months for free speech online but if free speech platforms can get through this they will be better and tougher for the long haul.  True  but who knows what the libs could accomplish now. Although  I  39 d THINK there  39 d be no way  now that you mention it  because of the SC... Who knows  though... they are good at finding loopholes.  I would like to direct your attention to GoDaddy delisting  a href  https   ar15.com  ar15.com  a    my above comment that they can delist stuff from DNS servers was apparently prophetic...  Idk who needs to read this but  Gab.com is fucking legit   Its a pandemic. The dems have shut down as much as they can. The businesses are scared to be the next ones cancelled so they cant take the risk when they are struggling to stay afloat.  All I can say is he should learn to pick his fights.  He didn  39 t pick any fights...with anyone.  victim blaming  Well he  em was  em  asking for it dressing that way and allowing dissent in public.  s  Nah more like trying to show off but instead it bit him in the ass  being an American is wasted on you  I  39 d say I use it to my advantage and due to that I  39 d say I  39 m pretty content.  And pretty clueless. Ignorance is bliss.  Not really  its more of not caring about stupid people when they face consequences.   Why yes I do  I  39 m one of the essential workers you hear about but the difference that my job may be one of the most essential ones.  I really dont know how you got me not having skills from that.   What did the CEO do that qualifies as  quot showing off quot    That many were competing for his business  Why would that make him deserving of collusion based market practices of the literally gate keepers of all apps for the US  I  39 m not following your logic.  Could be but also displays cockiness. Yes it would be admirable that he stands for unbridled free speech but in reality  just like we  39 ve seen with Gab  4chan and other examples  anything that is completely unregulated just gets flooded with illegal and horrendous actions and messages. This edginess comes forth from the thought of being anonymous and could lead to drastic actions.

I wouldn  39 t take a single thing they write at face value.  Did not know that... holy hell its worse than I thought  A scary amount of companies are owned by China.   quot Make your own website  quot  they said.  quot It  39 s the free market  quot  they said.  Meanwhile they demand every small business to be closed down.  Nobody Domestic Western will host it  they either get the Watkins sketchy ass hosting or the Russians China hosting it as a honeypot for user info. It  39 s dead  Exactly   there have been apps taken down before but this is different. If they fit into the same space as Twitter  then according to how Twitter has been treated  it should extend to Parler  platform v. Publisher debate . I m sure there is a better way to word it but I haven t had my coffee yet.  You need a host willing to take the backlash of hosting it  nobody in the western world will.   Censorship    I would sue Amazon  Apple  and Google to oblivion and back.  They have enough money to buy all the judges and hire all the lawyers. We  39 ll have to pull the plug on their electricity.   removed   I would love if a utility provider just did something to them and said  Our business is dedicated to American values  for that reason we can no longer supply the communist company  Apple with electricity. Dont like it  Make your own electricity    Haha... your power is shutoff until you provide verifiable evidence you are no longer actively participating in discrimination and censorship   It  39 s interesting. Apple  google  and amazon have said Parler have not done enough to limit calls to violence  but what criteria are they using to judge that  Are they using other platforms like twitter and Facebook as examples  Twitter lets that shit fly all the time if a lefty say it. Facebook does a decent job about moderating that stuff  but I  39 ve reported a few post that call for violence that are still up.  Yet allow agents of death and destruction  limited freedom China and Iran to remain       It was never about that and everyone with half a brain knows it.  They  39 ll be back up in just over a week.

Forbes is trash.  Yep  looks like rich liberal elites have taken over another one  Why didn  39 t they seek injunctive relief against Apple  Google  and Amazon   I would think they could show irrefutable harm by their actions.

Didn  39 t you know that moderate democrats are now considered to be the  quot new right quot  according to their party  so he had an even  quot bipartisan quot  consisting of half of these moderate democrats  GOP in their eyes  and half socialist extreme left wing people  democrats in their eyes .  I mean  his cabinet is controlled by far left tech CEOs.  No Republicans there.  Biden s a liar and water s wet.  Commitment   Now that s funny  that man can t stop lying  People who voted for him obviously do not know their dick from their thumb. Because honestly this is not surprisingly in the slightest.  Lying  racist AF POS.  Biden is going to do what Trump  em should  em  have done and purge every last holdover from the previous administration.  Even Obama has at least a RINO in his cabinet.  I voted for Biden. Here  39 s why.  So  You want Kamala Harris to be president  Because you re going to get radical crazy Kamala Harris as president.  I  39 m really hoping the guy with the crazy hair from The History channel who would say  quot Aliens quot  is correct.  OK  I was concerned there for a minute    Honestly  I will contribute to that guy s campaign funds  Yeah I joke troll in my own way. 
t3_kva3f1,Liberal senator calls on Senate Ethics Committee to expel censure or punish Cruz and Hawley,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kva3f1/liberal_senator_calls_on_senate_ethics_committee/,I recently watched the Star Wars prequels... and got a laugh out of  I am the Senate   from Palpatine as he used public perception to his advantage   seemed to hit so close to home.  I had the same thought. When having a conversation about the election one of the counterpoints was how much people hate trump. It dawned on me that the dark side  driven by hate  was the left today.  Wow.  This sounds like something that Hitler would approve of.  Sure. As soon as the Democrats expel every member who claimed Russia rigged 2016 or that Stacy Abrams is the real governor of GA.  Not to mention every one of them that explicitly called for street violence or defended it.  Keep going after them.... Youre going to make them the leaders for the 2024 nomination  I was under the assumption that objecting the electoral college was allowed by law. I mean  apparently it happened in 2005 and no one freaked out   Don t cloud the issue with facts.  Dangerous precident for the republic.  Democrats don  39 t want a republic.
t3_kuogl7,Delta kicks off two passengers for having private conversation supporting President Trump.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuogl7/delta_kicks_off_two_passengers_for_having_private/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  https   discord.gg conservative  a    removed   I agree. We need to be VERY careful about the news we circulate. Anything wrong  and leftists immediately wave the  false information  flag...which makes us look bad.   This is what they want  us to fear and question truths while they spread lies about us unfettered  Strong agree. Subs like  a href   r publicfreakouts  r publicfreakouts  a  live off the politically motivated editing of videos designed to cause outrage  usually with all previous context removed.  Is there actually any video showing what they actually said or did   I did a bunch of digging after coming across this  and unfortunately I have not yet found a video of their behavior prior to being forced to disembark. I ve seen two videos of them getting escorted off  but neither had any of the build up  so it ll be their word against Delta s.  No.  I haven t seen any but there were several videos on Twitter last night from bystanders who were all in shock about what was going down and their accounts seemed to verify the narrative.  If this is true my  quot do not support these companies quot  list is going to need another page.  Short of her saying  bomb    fire    gun  or  terrorist  or if she was berating someone or threatened physical violence  there really isn t any justification for removing someone from the plane.  People who support this think they re the resistance.  You  39 re not the  quot resistance quot  when all the big multinational corporations are with you  all the large educational institutions are with you  and the government is on your side as well.  But it  39 s easier that way. It  39 s too hard to go up against them. May as well go with them and think I  39 m a hero.  These people would be cheering for the Empire destroying Alderaan with the Death Star if they thought they liked Trump.  Is there a statement from Delta  Is there more to the story   My guess would be that there might be.  I read a post from someone in  a href   r publicfreakout   r publicfreakout  a  claiming to be on the plane the video starts as they re being escorted off the plane  so it doesn t verify anything  but he states he was sitting a couple rows in front of them with noise canceling earphones in  and their conversation was so loud he could hear them over his audio.  bUt dElTa iS A pRiVaTe cOmPaNy   It is funny that after 10 months of supporting shutdowns of entire industries  and arresting business owners who opened their shops  Dems will now pretend that they believe in private companies   Ron Paul always said true libertarianism requires strong courts that uphold the constitution and free speech  sad thing is even with our majority they  39 re just bumps on a log.  BuiLD yOUr oWn AirLInE  Right  a private company that only exists because it  39 s propped up by millions of taxpayer subsidies and frequent bailouts.  Somebody explained to me that when liberals say   quot That is a private company. If you don  39 t like what they are doing  then feel free not to use them  quot  what they mean is that the company is private because it  39 s not owned by the government.   im sure  a href   r libertarian  r libertarian  a  is ok with this  I think you mean  a href   r politicslite  r politicslite  a   First post I see... Eww.  Yeah what  39 s up with that place   I popped in there last week thinking I  39 d find some agreeable ideas but it looks more like Biden  39 s fan club.  As a libertarian  I joined that sub and then unsubscribed after about two weeks. I was new to Reddit  so first  I thought   holy shit  these people are crazy. I m not really a libertarian   Then I quickly realized just how distorted and left leaning peoples  points of view are on Reddit.  I know right how many billions has the government spent on the airline industry   This is their new favorite saying  Isn t the airline industry in the United States the beneficiary of heavy government subsidies  both airlines and airports   Sure are  Every 4 years it seems  I guess the left supports the baker who didn  39 t want to make a cake for a gay wedding now  right   REEEEE   No fucking way. Lol. There has to be more to this story. There is not a snowball  39 s chance in Hell.  Really  You still believe that  They silenced the sitting President of the United States and you re still here with the  not in this country  bullshit   I  39 m still trying to process all of this. It  39 s hard to take in. It  39 s Orwellian. The Democrat party is starting to resemble Ingsoc. I wanna believe there is more to this story.  I mean  just speculating  but this is the flight home after the demonstrations the guy with the dark circles under his eyes is on film exiting Congress after disrupting the vote certification debate I m betting they were pretty amped up on what they had done and probably carried some of that boisterous rally energy with them onto the plane. Again  just speculating  having flown on airplanes and having been careful never to get kicked off one...  They should sue Delta. They can t legally do that.  I was thinking the same thing  there might also be a hefty civil suit vs the TSA depending on what all they did as well.  They can refuse business to any customer for any reason  political affiliation is not a protected class  right   Courts have ruled in some instances that airline access is protected under your right to travel. So there are legal challenges that can be mounted but I suspect it will be an uphill battle. But hey u might get a nice settlement  Technically speaking  the two people already paid and the company was fine with it. Kicking them off for talking about Trump could be discrimination based on political beliefs. Unless the company issues a full refund  I can t see them getting away from this without legal issues.  I have no doubt they got a full refund  that  39 s the only way to absolve yourself of legal exposure.  In some states  like California   it is.  Except it  39 s okay to have sex with people without disclosing you have HIV.  I  39 ll bet only one side  though.  FAA regulations state there has to be a reason why.  I can  39 t remember the exact terminology.  But there needs to be a reason why  and if it was for something nonviolent they usually have to compensate them  like they would if you get bumped .  No they can t  They actually can. There is no legal provision for discrimination for politics.  Unless they issued a full refund  they are not allowed to deny service to people who ve already paid.  If this is true then wow. This is like in Socialist Yugoslavia where if you didn t have a picture of Tito hung on the wall overlooking your dining table or openly disagreed with ANYTHING about him  you d either be imprisoned or relocated to another region for  work .  And how about these tough guys on the plane jeering at older women. But hey  as long as you re a white conservative there are no expectations on being treated humanely. These scumbags are true parasites. I d love to see how tough they are one on one with a grown man...  Unreal...  Unbelievable and disgusting. Shocked what is going on right now. They are coming for us and its pure disgusting.  they are coming for us and it is being praised  remind you of anything in relatively recent world history   sure. lots of things. none of them good.  Orwell predicted the future.  I told my husband when he was flying out of dc don t say a single thing about trump I told him the same thing flying In. It s insane that you have to hide your beliefs now days.  I have been sadly hiding for the last 4 years. I m in California and I feel like I m part of an underground resistance  A good portion of my family still lives in the la area my heart goes out to you.  Something something Soviet Russia.  the soyboys yelling get off the plane lmao  This has to be a joke...  They already have no opinions for themselves. They think whatever they are told to think.  Charged with 2 counts of 1st degree whiteness  Here in chicago a vietnamese restaurant was canceled because the owner went to the dc protest. So its not just white people. Its trump supporters in general.  Only white supremacist support trump. I know it  39 s confusing I don  39 t get it as well  but in 21 you can be a Vietnamese white supremacist if needed  This is getting ridiculous  It probably isn t even in delta s policy  just that one leftist flight attendant couldn t stand by without suppressing speech. They should have told him to call the pilot or his manager or something and then he would ve given up for the day  What the fuck  This can  39 t stand.  Cause we are  You gotta make that  quot wedding quot  cake though ....  And it begins.  I heard they also refused to wear masks or something like that.  lawsuit time   Just remember that any form of discrimination it s entitled to a generous compensation in a court of law. Be prepared  be ready for a niece payday.  Fuck Delta.  They  39 ve always sucked.  I refuse to fly them and now I guess I got one more reason.  Fucking tyrants. Do we have enough          removed    removed    removed    removed   Wtf  They should say they are lesbians.  In a few years time talking about Trump will be like talking about Hitler. You will have to be very careful what you say and anything that looks like support or positive praise will be a cancel able offense.

They had people with war drums beating. Literally.  Not figuratively.  They lined up with shields while someone had a huge drum.  It was terrifying and made my skin feel electrified.  Noone spoke a peep when BLM was overrunning DC  but the moment a conservative throws his garbage away and misses the garbage can  there is literally a revolution happening  If Trump was complacent in causing a Riot by saying  quot Go home in Peace quot   Ooooooh scaaaaaary.

To say that this was comparable to Kristallnacht is highly inappropriate. Even comparing what happened at the capitol to the BLM riots isn t a great comparison.. literally millions of dollars worth of damage with more than 23 people killed  in the span of 7 months. The terminator needs to read a book  preferably 1984   Yeah  Chuck Schumer compared it to Pearl Harbor. Saying it will be another day that  Goes down in history.  These people making such insane comparisons to events in history that changed the course of it forever to some violent rioters vandalizing the Capitol. Don t get me wrong  what happened was awful and those that broke the law should be punished accordingly. To compare it to an attack on our country by a foreign nation in a time of peace that cost the lives of 2000  Americans and the destruction of a huge portion of our naval fleet is a grave disservice to those that died on December 7th  1941.  History of attacks on the white house    Starting ww2 .....or smearing poop on a wall. Yep. SAME.   Pearl harbor didn  39 t start ww2  One politician  don  39 t remember his name  said it was worse than 9 11.  Billions of dollars not just millions  I mean  23 killed in 7 months comes to roughly 0.1 dead people per day vs 5 in one day at the capital.  As soon as someone compares any current event to the horror of WW2  39 s nazis treatment of jews  gypsies  homosexuals  mentally retarded  etc. it just invalidates their statement.   It shows they have no grasp of what happened.  Says the son of a literal Nazi  He actually talked about that in the video. Talked about how his father would come home drunk and beat him but he thought that was a normal thing because everyone s dad would come home drunk and beat their kids.

Arnold is now a total joke of a moron.  He s been a joke for a while.  He goes on TV to make some pitch about the environment  and then gets into his Hummer  goes to an airport  flies privately halfway across the world to film a shitty movie.  And the race to outdo others in outrage continues. We should make a list of the ridiculous claims so far. About the only comparison I haven  39 t heard yet is to Hiroshima or Nagasaki.  Just wait  Arnold Schwarzenegger  39 s father was literally a Nazi   Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn t lack empathy  he lacks intelligence  Poor Arnold is going to go down in history as an asshole  These people are out of minds. It will be compared to genocide pretty soon.  To be fair  this is slightly less stupid than the guy who said it was worse than 9 11. Slightly.  More projection.   And the 2018 occupation of the US Capitol by democrats during Kavanaugh  39 s SCOTUS confirmation hearing        Irrelevant since T2.  A washed up has been  em and  em  dumb as dirt. He deserves pity.  If you compare anything happening in America today to the nazis it really shows how uneducated you really are and how ignorant you are to real struggles around the world. As annoying and frustrating things are here a majority of the people on the globe alive have it worse.  Tell that to a Jew... he still have more muscles than brain.  I  39 m more upset his movies for the last 25 years have just gotten worse progressively  Kindergarten Cop was 1990  Establishment globalist do nazi things and then point at the opposition and claim nazi. Sad.  Only someone that  39 s rich and powerful would compare the rich and powerful to the Jews who were massacred and genocided....  The steh woids fucked up more than his cock.  About as equally crazy as Pelosi  39 s whiteness statement.  Another one who needs re education on our history and the Nazis...  Looks like the T 800 model got an upgrade and now has the ability to be a giant  wrinkled  loudmouth douchebag as well.  By 2025  Kristallnacht won  39 t even have any meaning because the left keeps using it as a comparison to everything they don  39 t like.  I don  39 t think I  39 d describe Arnold as left wing though. Maybe a tad milquetoast.  Let s be honest  Arnie has been part of some great movies  but he hasn t done anything good in almost 30 years. Don t be coming in here being all   What about  End of Days    The 6th Day    or T3  Blah  blah  blah  blah.  His last good movie was  True Lies   end of discussion.   Arnold is a life long Republican  former GOP Governor of California and even did one of the introductions for Milton Friedman  39 s Free to Choose. He  39 s definitely done a lot outside of acting.  Someone call ICE  I m sick of being called NAZI. Especially when the left is using every  fascist play in the playbook

You right. You can see why I stick to machine learning and not biology.  The  em vast  em  majority of the positive tests are asymptomatic. This is supported by the 99.7  survival rate. That many people getting deathly ill would cause the virus to spread exponentially and be species threatening.  This too. Asymptomatic or else  how would you call it  it s just a cold flu symptomatic.  Some would call it the sniffles.  At this point I don t even believe them tbh  need confirming studies done.  So just to be clear  now the terrible pandemic virus doesn  39 t actually get you sick. You have it but you don  39 t know it because it doesn  39 t do anything.

Curious to see what comes out in the next few hours.  I mean hell has already frozen over  it s snowing right now in southeast Texas  so i could believe just about anything right now.  Lol is it really snowing in SE Texas  That is awesome. I think like most people everyone really just wants to know the truth. Everyone has feelings that stuff isn t quite right up there in Washington. Especially when people like Epstein just walk out of prison years ago and later it s proven he had connections with the world elite and was involved in some bad bad stuff  Wasn t the Pope arrested today   is it Christmas again already   I saw something remarking on it but so far I have not seen anything official myself. I m just seeing rumors and whispers at this point.  Same  trying to do some research...but I m sure if it s true  they re keeping a lid on the information for a bit  I think the Pope rumor may have been started because some users saw  a  possible police car in a live stream. I don t see anything other than that. One person wrote a blog about it because it s seen from his apartment and that it was a street sweeper and he has no reason to believe the blackout arrests etc.   I read that the pope s doctor is covid positive but that s about it  I heard blackout because they were  quot changing roof lights quot  or some such nonsense   a href  https   youtu.be dCDr9ft0Ym4  rel  nofollow  there is indeed a blackout     a   I read that too. Darn   Dark web is either correct or effective at making up a story based around facts.  Probably just effective at making up stories haha  That s a given  although some stuff does leak there first. At this point I think Trumps rolling over  but I do love a good conspiracy theory.  there absolutely is. our military picks up everything that travels over the airwaves.  Yeah I have an acquaintance that works in Military Intelligence and their capabilities are no joke. They wouldn t need special forces to obtain a laptop. They could just grab all the data remotely. Granted I m completely ignorant as to the encryption levels on this particular laptop but it seems highly unlikely they would need to arrange for something like this.  Intel vs making a case would be my guess  The Vatican and Pakistan mysteriously went dark last night..  Why would they arrest the pope  Probably a 4chan rumor troll honestly lol  I don t even see a shred of what could constitute even a hint at this being true.  Iin Wood was the first to say it that I saw.  The Lin Wood who posted THIS to Parler   I qualified it by saying he said it first.  Well  Wood is a nutcase. Rittenhouse would do well to make sure Wood is nowhere near his defense team.  The pope is behind the vote changing in Georgia  try to keep up  What.  This is ridiculous  So... Uhh bear with me here because I looked this up yesterday and it definitely sounds a bit nutty.  Bit of a rabbit hole but it was interesting to say the least.  Child trafficking  Who the heck knows. If it s true  guess we ll find out eventually  I  39 m sure there is stuff someone as powerful as the pope does that would be worthy of it  that said would anyone even bother to investigate  No  Wut  lmao  Yeah I saw a weird one saying he was gonna announce some stuff over the emergency broadcast system  and in the next couple weeks surprising arrests would be made. Then saw another post saying apple was gonna disable the EBS in an iphone update   a href  https   youtu.be n2Ady3z Xy8  https   youtu.be n2Ady3z Xy8  a   Fuck 2020. Any other year I am a calm rational person  but this past year has turned me into a full on conspiracy theorist.  Someone noted yesterday that the term conspiracy theorist was coined by the cia to discredit anyone who questioned their illegal AF operations.  Not sure if it  39 s true  but I wouldn  39 t be surprised at this point.  Like that ever stopped a tech company before.  Yeah but there  39 s a difference between  quot dancing on the grey line of legality quot   and flagrantly disabling the EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYSTEM  or in any way  messing with it.  Witch hunt. Hope these liberals are proud of themselves  Why do people even care about what Forbes says  I m ready to go down with the ship  liberty or death  Just start calling these people fascists cause that  39 s what they are  Sounds like a solid case of harassment.  Sue the Forbes    Target them right back.  When someone declares that they are dead ...  Epitomy of being Racist  
t3_kul32n,Gab Picking Up 10000 Users Per Hour CEO Claims After Trumps Twitter Ban,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kul32n/gab_picking_up_10000_users_per_hour_ceo_claims/,how good is gab  They are their own platform so they can  39 t be deplatformed. They have fought that battle before. They are 100  free speech.  Gab is their own host. They got deplatformed because they are 100  free speech. They even allow hate speech unless it is a direct call to violence if I read correctly.  There are still two ways they can be deplatformed   DNS and ISP.  Both have already been used to deplatform  quot neo Nazi quot  websites.  What do you think they  39 re calling Gab at this point   Are they legit neo nazis or are the edgy 4chan type  in effect not. If enough of these genuine 1A people sign up it would shift the demographic very quickly   They aren t even as bad as 4Chan was  Minds it is then.  We have to battle the neo nazis on their own ground.  The neo nazis don  39 t believe in liberty  We  39 ve got to stop playing defensive.  It  39 s just a matter of time there won  39 t be anywhere to run to.  Okay  but  em how  em     We bring Amazon and Twitter up on class action lawsuits  For following their own ToS  A private company has rights as well  neither are owned by the public. It would be different if they were government ran companies.  They might be hosting out of some random ass country. We don  39 t know they seem to be OK people like Milo are on there for years now.  They have their own servers  not sure where they are located  but a local ISP will be providing them internet service.  The leftist mob or DS could get the ISP to deplatform them.  I think they hid where they are located now because of that  If they are hosted in another country  the president can ban access to the website.  VPN  39 s ignore bans pretty well.  You should read how google define what Gab is      Then it isn  39 t hate speech. That is a flagarant term with no concrete definition. Except of course for real violence  Real violence or inciting is called a  quot call to action quot  which is illegal under 1A. The same for slander and fraud  lying under oath etc  and a couple other things that have no bearing on the website.  None which occured so  But getting deplatformed for hate speech i.e. allowing racial slurs and what not isnt uncommon by most private businesses today. It hurts their image and so they distance themselves as quickly as possible. A company cannot be blamed for excorsizing it  39 s own rights just because it  39 s not concurrent with your own perceived way companies should work.  That  39 s Parler  I m aware. Parler was said to not be deplatformed either. Yet they were.  Everyone knew Parler was going to be deplatformed by Amazon  people that didn  39 t were na ve.  Cool. Sign me up. Oh  I do it myself.  It  39 s unreachable now. Twitter refugees hugged it to death.  It s been crashing all day from the surge of users. Looks just like Twitter.  People pay to use Gab so you are not a product. Fuck all these other sites selling our information. I m so tired of that shit. I don t mind paying for a service.  The people who own gab are the same people who own every other social media platform. In today  39 s world  the number of people who do not pay attention to this stuff is astounding.   If we cannot live on social media together how in the hell can we live in a country together      People are polite in person  when there  39 s the threat of being punched in the face if they mouth off the same way we  39 ve seen online behind anonymous logins and firewalls.  I agree  I am just worried that no good can come from this. People need to be routinely exposed to opinions they disagree with.   That s the plan  Yeah  except leftists always assume that everyone in the room agrees with them so they  39 ll say incendiary things IRL too with the expectation they aren  39 t going to get called on it.  yeah. they can say whatever they want and everyone will agree because no one wants to get knocked out.  I ve experienced this same thing. Even the most hateful liberals when seeing them in person tuck their tail between their legs.  The internet is known for anonymity  which allows people to say whatever they want with little chance for repercussion. The real world is a whole new ball game with every phone having a camera and the newer generations being sue happy.  I am just concerned that the dual social media dichotomy that is rapidly forming can only do more harm than good. It is always better to at least see what people you disagree with think and say on social media.  Itll just split the internet up more into two sides for american politics. In reality itll have no bearing on day to day life unless people start asking  quot hey what  39 s your twitter facebook handle so I can add you quot  then itll just be a precursor to people who are politically motivated to cease talking to you unless required to like at a job.  They might not want it  but I believe we should not give into spiteful temptation  that s what they want us to do.  Gab  39 s description according to Wokepedia   Here s 10 001  Gab has been  quot under maintenance quot  for the past couple of hours. I sincerely hope that really what  39 s going on.  most likely upgrading their servers for the massive waves of people that are joining. I think I saw someone on their post about how they re excited for the new servers or something but I m not sure  It  39 s new servers being setup  Seems like they  39 re setting up new servers because of the surge they  39 ve reported they  39 re experiencing. I  39 ll have to check back tomorrow to see if it  39 s done by then.  Yeah  they came back online after a few hours last night.  Gab needs to think ahead and start decentralizing itself. That is the only future proof solution to the vastly growing problem.  Here  39 s how to install on your phone   Available only on Android  so funny I was telling the wife I wanted to switch to a Samsung next before I get too tied to Apple. I like the more open OS idea.   Ah thank you. I recently switched to Android I  39 m glad I did. However  I wish we had an open source OS without Google  39 s involvement. I know there is some out there  but I  39 m not sure if they are stable.  Lineage OS is the FOSS version of Android  100  agree  it s getting crazy just how much everyone is relying on the big 3  Amazon  Google  Apple .  I  39 m a big believer in  quot niche brand quot  Android phones  but the trouble with them is that with the smaller user base it  39 s harder to find support and instructions for rooting so you can use a FOSS OS  Lineage  replacement.  Ditching Apple on my next upgrade too.  warning  google android is basically spyware  Welcome to 2021     Gab I go  I won  39 t dispute it because everyone likes a place where their 1st amendment rights aren  39 t blocked  I think I m done with social media for a little  when this sub goes I go  Same.  Reddit is all I have left and honestly I  39 ve wanted to delete it for a while.  Twitter was deleted  I never used it anyway  and I don  39 t care to sign up for Gab of it  39 s the same thing.  I always felt Twitter was cancer anyway.  When Gab first launched  I believed it would piss some mainstream people off and then fade into obscurity. But I was wrong  apparently. It  39 s  em exploding.  em   GAB should offer to host Parler.  This is really the best option. I wouldn  39 t be surprised if Gab helps them out or buys them out.  This dude hit the lottery  assuming he doesn  39 t get pulled from the server. Which he probably will be. This is a scary fucking time  even for moderates  who haven  39 t lost their fucking minds  Does GAB have an APP  I cannot seem to find it.  They have been banned from both play store and Ios store. You have to use other ways to install it   a href  https   apps.gab.com application 5d3f982c9dd49a5b1d9fc881  https   apps.gab.com application 5d3f982c9dd49a5b1d9fc881  a .  Yeah  to that  39 s not an app  it  39 s a shortcut to the webpage.  No  you can get the APK file from there.  Do you have to be logged into the site in order to see it  If not  can you tell me how exactly  All I see are instructions on how to place a shortcut from Chrome on the website. I click  quot Web quot  and it takes me to the website. And when I click  quot download history quot  it wants me to login. But I don  39 t see any other links that give me the apk to install on the Android.  If you re on iPhone you can add them to your home screen to at least get to them quickly but yea would be nice to have an app  but blame Apple google.  Thanks  Their servers are being overwhelmed by the traffic  Hopefully the wave of refugees will dramatically improve the quality of the userbase  which has been the main thing holding Gab back up to this point.  CEO is stupid to advertise that  as the pressure will be put on all the corporate and tech assets they rely on.  figure the commies are going to target IT next.  Just tried to join and the server is timing out before confirming membership. Hopefully they re just busy processing requests and not getting shut down.  How do you get Gab   The app on App Store is for Georgetown  They were kicked off the App Store.  You have to go to their website and then add it to your home screen  Thanks  saw the other comments but appreciate the post response   Offer to host parler  pornhub  etc. Other companies that have been recently strong armed by being dependent on big business.  They run their own server  39 s and only use a local ISP which is unknown at this point.  He is saying they should host other websites that have fallen under the same ridicule as theirs would on the open net without their own hosting ability hidden ISP. But bringing in other websites hurts the camouflage that GAB has been using.  How does one even get on gab  I looked in the Apple store and I couldn t find it. I pulled it up online and only could get there if I typed the url in directly  the link from the search engine was loading so slow that I almost thought it was blocked . In either case  I couldn t find a link online and I couldn t find it in the Apple store.  There is no app  just the web page  That explains it. It  39 s going to be hard for that to be a true alternative if it doesn  39 t have an app.  They could make one for android and make a walkthrough on installing apps outside the app store  but for apple it  39 s not possible.  Does gab have an app from the play store or is it all web site driven   Just the website  Yes  they have an app.  They will son be canceled too. Enjoy it while it lasts.  They were cancelled years ago. The CEO knew that the actions of the past few days would happen and that people would flock to them as an oasis since they have developed their own infrastructure. It appears to be paying off.  They own their own servers

As Obama  39 s defense secretary Robert Gates says in his memoir   quot  Biden has  been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades. quot   The larger question is whether Beijing will keep its word.

It s nature to scare the shit out of them.  Haha this is utter BS. Bomb threat so serious that you don t send anyone home      Just fake outrage after fake outrage lol  Was it Jussie Smollett giving Amazon the hot tip   I obviously don  39 t want to see more violence.  There are rights I would die for and things I wouldn  39 t.  Right now  the election and other things is not worth a civil war  violence or dying for.  I will say  their politically based move to shutdown Parler isn  39 t going to help the current climate.  It is going to make things worse.  Completely agree. Respondomg with violence only proves their point  If they took their safety and these threats seriously  why not send them home    Andddddd this thing is gonna make a head pretty soon a burst..  So they  39 d put their workers in danger   It  39 d be an honest shame if a totally not BLM crowd peacefully protested an Amazon data center.  Oh  bullshit. This is no different than the  quot orchestrated plot quot  to kidnap the governor of Michigan. A bunch of idiots on their keyboards sprouting off some nonsense and the Left using it to further their political agendas. Probably agents of the agencies deliberately seeking to stir the pot.

She  39 s awful silent on that now.  I ll admit when I m wrong  and Elizabeth Warren was spot on here with exploring anti trusts against them early. Four tech companies can create a cartel and silence anyone they feel.   The scary thing is that their power isn t limited to just this country. It s global. They can change national loyalties at their convenience.  Imagine going into a war cause Jack Dorsey interfered in another countries politics by selective banning and the US Government couldn t do anything.  Could be like a real life Elliot Carver  from James Bond fame   I actually considered voting in their primary for her based on this issue. We re about 20 years past due on kicking the IT trust busting into gear and closer to 50 for banking.  I know its an unpopular opinion  but it will backfire.

t3_kujuzz,Parler CEO Blasts Coordinated Attack by Tech Giants to Kill Competition as Amazon Pulls Its Servers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kujuzz/parler_ceo_blasts_coordinated_attack_by_tech/,Let this be a lesson to any CEO thinking about moving even more of their computing and storage to third party cloud servers.  He s right and I think he has a good case to sue.  He d lose.  Twitter stock drops after they ban Trump and suddenly multiple megacorps simultaneously shut down their biggest competition.  You d have to prove in a court of law that these companies colluded against Parler to squeeze them out of the market instead of just upholding their service agreements.  We already saw Zuckerberg crap himself in front of Congress when asked about Facebook and Twitter colluding to censor people.  they have already admitted to sharing information like this in previous senate hearings.  the antitrust suits are already happening. and a bunch of congresspeople from both sides have talked about the antitrust today.  they were also talking criminal acts too  like civil violations. I could see that taking hold possibly.  Who did Ma Bell collude with   Service agreements don  39 t mean jack shit against an anti trust lawsuit.  The us government is going to be the one suing not parler  in antitrust   Parler v. Amazon  sure Parler would lose.  A breach of contract claim would fail.  Other causes of action are viable.  That would be fine if any of these things happened on a 1 1 basis  but this is clear cooperation between the tech companies to do this  anticompetitive collusion is illegal  They 100  have a reasonable case for an antitrust lawsuit. It would be pretty easy to find other apps or websites that have either the same or worse content and show they are being singled out  They could try  but unlikely to succeed.  they have already filed the antitrust lawsuit against google and even californias attorney general joined. it is 100  happening. the rest probably soon to follow  That s an article from December  that doesn t involve Parler. It s a totally separate suit on a totally separate issue.  Twitter itself has had some bad stuff recently.  Doesn t matter. The contract can t trump statute as a matter of law. For instance  Reddit can t put in its user agreement that they can boot you for being a particular race. Similarly  Amazon can t use its user agreement to circumvent the various anti trust statues. Now  I m not as certain of these facts making for a great case but if  for instance  discovery revealed the various tech giants getting together to orchestrate this ... well  that would be illegal on its face.  I  39 d disagree.Reasoning under Common law.    Amazon  39 s failure to give Parler a  quot commercially reasonable quot  period to  em cure  em  is also somewhat suspect. Given they canceled them over a weekend with very little notice.  Supposedly Amazon has been in talks with Parler since November about this issue  so not exactly sudden.  I  39 d really like to see what the  quot violent content quot  that they reported to Parler actually looked like. While I  39 m sure some of it is legitimate  I have my doubts that the content that Parler did not choose to remove actually included violence.  I  39 d bet money that for ever message on parler promoting violence you  39 d find a tweet to match.  I also wouldn  39 t be surprised if their definition of  quot violent speech quot  didn  39 t also include things they just don  39 t like so they can point and go  quot SEEEEEEE THEY DIDN  39 T TAKE DOWN EVERYTHING WE REPORTED quot .  Meanwhile there  39 s a thriving pedophile community on twitter that somehow never gets touched among other things.   As long as they aren  39 t right wing pedos then its all good apparently  Yeah  and AWS can t say a couple screenshots of bad posts were observed. Bad posts occur on literally every platform and are eventually removed through some moderation system. Parler was likely overwhelmed with new users in the past week. Seems bad faith to cherry pick some posts and boot them.  You can still sue for anti trust reasons  Just because you have an agreement that says you can do whatever you want does not mean you are no longer required to follow the laws.  Plenty of contracts are ignored by courts because they know it s unconstitutional.  Right  but what s unconstitutional about Apple  Google and Amazon saying  em  we don t want to do business with you anymore   em    I m not a lawyer but I know a monopoly when I see one.  Agreements also can t just be broken when nothing was done to break them except you don t like their beliefs.  That s persecution and prejudice.  You should probably read the agreements. Amazon says they can break the agreement for any reason  or no reason  in 30 days. By using Amazon s services  Parler agreed to that agreement.  As much as I agree with your position  unfortunately political beliefs are not a protected category  and first amendment does not apply to private transactions and spaces.  Service agreement or no  I think they have a case.  Correct me if I  39 m wrong but anti trust laws are still anti trust laws  if he can prove that they removed him to keep alternatives to Twitter down no 5k terms and servuce page of 300 lawyers can stop that from being the truth.  Yes but he d have to prove that Amazon  Apple  and or Google colluded with Twitter to destroy his company.  Crazy how the left have been bitching about Trump being an existential threat for 4 years  but are cheering this shit which is against everything our country stands for. This is the kind of stuff that will bring this country down  when we can  39 t agree on the basic values. We need more speech  more viewpoints  more honest debate  not less.    He is evil and they can buy their own servers  operating system  phones  etc   I  39 ve had three separate people brigading the sub message me today about this matter. Two were decent  one was a real dickhead. Between the three of them  not one messaged me back after ten or so exchanged messages.  Break up big tech  regulate big pharma  Cancelled Prime today. Time to hit Big Tech where it hurts.  I ve thought about this but if I go down that road  I might as well toss my TVs because there really aren t any companies left that would give them any use.  Definitely. You couldn t use any device or service if you go down that road.  My Amazon use has decreased exponentially in the last few years.  Make sure you let them know your reasons for cancelling   They signed up to host their right leaning platform on the servers of a company whose CEO owns the Washington Post  a rabidly anti Trump  quot news quot  outlet. I don  39 t know how they can be surprised and unprepared for this. Amazon treats its own employees like disposable meat. The content that comes out of Amazon is pretty darned leftist  much of the time. Remember when Wal Mart was reviled for using its size to run small businesses into the ground  Amazon does that on a scale so massive it puts other large retail corporations out of business. They  39 re the pinnacle of capitalist elitism  and the left loves them.  It s not to kill competition it s just to kill any remotely moderate right media  We call it  quot The Alex Jones Effect quot .   deleted   I do not share your optimism  Second this .  This is a good thing in the long run tbh.  Trump will be out of office too most likely and able to work on building up competition as well to the tech giants.  Liberals are the fascists they claim to hate  can parler win against big tech  Whatever method Parler uses to operate independently of big tech will be made illegal by Patriot Act 2.0.

They re not even comparable at this point  Okay  who gave Nancy the wine bottle opener   It was right next to her 20 000 dollar fridge and 500 dollar cooler  I was gonna make a joke.. but in all honesty  if I had her kind of money  I  39 d also own a  20k fridge. Hell  I allready own a Yeti cooler for hunting and fishing haha.  Is the Yeti really that badass   Yes. I got one because sometimes I am away from any electricity civilization for a week or more. The Yeti will indeed keep the ice frozen for that long. It has paid for itself  I think I spent  400  six seven years ago   many times over.  Woh  In my day we d steal a cooler to get at the beer. Now the cooler itself is the hot commodity    Ha  Yeah. I guess I was better behaved. I  39 d just take the beer  and I knew the owner. Thanks dad   I can confirm. It really is   I bought the Yeti when I was a single man... now that I have a kid  I can relate. If you were worried about ice lasting a week  I take it you weren  39 t at Camp Pleasureneck  land of wifi and ice cream .  Bahaha  literally cackling at that one. No no I wasn  39 t.  But I will digress as i was aircrew on the black helicopters  so we had it good for the most part  they just liked pushing out to where a perimeter was a roll of razor wire  and water points were in   39 town  39  and run by the afghans.  Baghhh good times in the wild west.  I was in a not nice Helmand fob and crapped in a plastic bag most days  war changes a man . But once a month  I was able to fly to Leatherneck to get crypto for the radios. I have a picture of steak and lobster dinner hahaha. I still sometimes have dreams about how great Mongolian bbq night was.   Hats off to those in the helmand  he  39 ll of a fireworks show more days than not in that area.  Ive got a few airborne shits  ammo cans and boxes here  under my belt  but no comparison to those who did it for months on end.  Oh hell  it was a long time ago. I remember pitching a bitch and the chief told me  quot if it stops leaking  that  39 s when you need to be worried. quot  Still makes me laugh.  Didn t she support violent riots this summer   If Trump is impeached then Waters  Pelosi  Schumer  AOC  and many others must also be removed for same reason.  Projection. I figured out this was Nixon Watergate when you consider big tech is coordinating at the Democrat Party s request.  They  39 re going to do it but they have no grounds. Opposing or questioning election results is not impeachable.  And he absolutely did not tell anyone to storm the Capitol.  If they  39 re going off of evidence  not hate  they have no case.  But  they do whatever they want and don  39 t abide by law  They  39 ll never get to a trial before he leaves office  but if I was Trump  39 s lawyer during an impeachment trial my opening statement would simply be  em every single statement  em  Democrats have made in support of the riots all throughout 2020 and ask where the impeachment for them was.  Yep.  Along with the exact words from Trump  39 s speech that day where he specifically said  be peaceful.  That alone  in realville  should end it.  Why are they talking about this   The guy is out in 10 days  I  39 d imagine he  39 d already be out of office by the time hearings and votes are all wrapped up  From what I ve been able to learn  they could prevent him from running for office again. Additionally  if they were to actually remove him  he loses secret service protection  among other fringe benefits like pension  etc.  not that he d actually take the money I imagine since he s only making  1 year right now .  He trusts his own security more anyway.  It won  39 t work again  Nancy is wasting her breath...  Says the woman who attempted to stage a coup.  Fuck off  Pelosi

Why the fuck is Marriot donating to political candidates  LOL.  I believe that  39 s an output of Citizens United  there  39 s a good chance I  39 m wrong .   Damn  seems like conservatives were wrong about this one...  Oh I know why  and thanks for posting for others. I just think it makes zero sense. Like  Burger King probably donates to political campaigns now and I get the principle  I just don  39 t understand the practice. Politicians should represent the people  not corporations. Framers really gave fuck all about it  and for good reason.  Also  the double standard in objecting to election results.  Jamie Raskin  Permila Jayapal  Barbara Lee  Sheila Jackson  Raul Grijalva  and Maxine Waters all objected to the 2016 certification. Maxine Waters also objected in 2000 and 2004.  Well put.  Like any other large industry  they donate and lobby their business goals succeed.  But Marriot will keep spamming my phone with robocalls.  Like every single day. The nerve of these asshats.  LPT  Listen to the call all the way through and at the end you can opt out.  Thank you  thank you  thank you...  Those are scam callers  I wonder if they gave back donations to all the Democrats who spent the last four years braying about Trump not being a legitimate president of the United States   a claim underwritten by the ridiculous and utterly disproven conspiracy theory of Russian alteration of election results.   We have reached an unbelievable level of political hypocrisy now  haven  39 t we  For 4 years  we got cries of Russian collusion. We were told that Russia hacked the election. Leftists said Trump  39 s election was illegitimate. If you didn  39 t subscribe to the opinion of Russian interference  you were seen as being complicit in the destruction of American democracy.  That  39 s a scam though  right  I don  39 t think the hotel is behind those calls.  I suspend my donations to marriott   deleted   Well said  glad my va benefits are tax free  and I try my hardest to trade my sawmill work for silver gold and lead hahah  Same  Why does the establishment resort to cancel culture  Because they think there won t be any counter cancellations. Let s make sure that isn t true.  Except Marriott is Mormon and conservative and Republican so...there s that.  Yeah  I m not sure why they d think Marriott is liberal if they re donating to republican senators in the first place.  Yeah  they pretty much know most will forget in a month or two. Let  39 s not forget and take names like they are.  Doesn t Romney have deep ties to the Marriott  This is probably the most expected move then.  If they are consistent they would cut off those who were part of the  not my president  movement too  but I will not hold my breath  Remember when the MSM said that our president was a Russian agent for 3 years    I also remember when Sheila Jackson Lee  Maxine Waters  Pramila Jayapal  and several others objected to Trump  39 s certification in 2016.  Remember when outgoing Attorney General Lynch called for blood in the streets   Funny they have riot in their name lol  Just noticed that  What about the Democratic members of Congress that challenged the Electoral College in 2000  2004  and 2016  aka every Republican win this century   Are they banned from receiving donations  too    deleted   Marriott is Goose Stepping  didnt the Soviets have a similar leg thing in their parade marching      Cool  I travel frequently for work  have  titanium elite  status with them. I ll just give my business back to Hilton.  I prefer Hilton anyway.  I prefer the Howard Johnson. I like the smell of stale cigarettes and the faint sound of an abusive couple yelling at each other in the background as I fall asleep into my 50 thread count sheets  That s right. I want to feel like I m at home when I m traveling.  I do too tbh  for whatever reason my business prefers Marriott and when they schedule stuff for me they often choose Marriott by default. But I can request whatever hotel I want within a certain price range  which Marriott and Hilton are usually close in price  plus on many trips just do the scheduling myself.   Oh yea. I m still not stupid about sharing personal info on here  but it s refreshing to know that I work for a company that s never gonna go  woke . If I got doxed for being at a Trump rally or similar and they called my boss about it  guarantee you he d use the word  snowflake  before hanging up on them  then call me and laugh about it.   Must be nice. My wife s company gets almost daily emails from their CEO with his thinly veiled political views. They suffered actual damage from the BLM riots and have bent over backwards to appease  while the recent events at the Capitol were  of course  the worst thing ever.  Titanium elite with Ambassador here.   I was just thinking the same thing.  These businesses are choosing sides in the next civil war.  Pay attention  this is going downhill fast.  Just wait until the democrats start forcing marriotts to be a homeless shelter. Yes its happening in the state of Washington to certain hotels.  I m tired of every business and corporation going political. Hopefully that ll change now that their boogeyman Trump is out of office. Like just let me stay in your hotels Marriott.   removed   I do not.... where  39 s my donation Marriott   Worth a try right   I don  39 t even need a donation. Just a 25  discount and free hot breakfast.  Yeah...the free hot breakfast has been suspended until COVID goes away.  Question nothing peasant. Politburo has decided. Accept it or gulag for you.  America is beyond corrupt.  Marriott is owned but a prominent Mormon and has strong ties to Romney. What is with all these loser Mormons in the political world  Did the Marriot leadership take this stance when the Democrats refused to accept Trump  39 s win in 2016   when this is over remember everyone that sided with the traitors.  Screw all of those companies  keep corporate money out of politics.  They can do without my stays. I know a lot of people who will avoid them.

Google doesn  39 t have nearly as much control of Android that Apple does of iOS.

Doesn t apple benefit from child labor and slave labor in China   I guess investigating or questioning wrong doings is a no no  Show me who they supported.  Mitt Romney was on Marriott s board a few times. I don t think he is anymore but probably made a call or two...  The worst thing about this is the other chains are worse.  Sure  you could switch from Marriott to Hilton  but all that gets you is non stop cnn and MSNBC in the lobby  and active donations to tides and AOC.  Age of conservatism and pro americanism is dead. When american companies are anti american and they rather do business in china than here  we have lost. I have to find a new home. Again.  Obey and submit  or else.

If leftists can bitch and moan publicly and get what they want  which is bizarre to me in the first place  why can  39 t we do it privately  with our wallets  I bet they will change the narrative real quick.   There are at least 75 million of us and we tend to be the ones with the money and the jobs and the reasons to travel. If we all pulled our business from Marriott  they would feel it.  There are other hotels out there. I  39 d rather give them my business to stay quiet and true to their business rather than support a business that limits free speech or to express their own views in a country that actually allows you to do so.  Nah this will result in a massive boycott of Marriott  narrator  it won  39 t  You try having autism  ADHD  and a constant sense of boredom that only goes away if you re on your phone or video games. It s painful for me and I m a conservative soon to be independent but still on President Trump s side after the GOP went and backed the bus right over him and fell right into Antifa s stupid ass trap.  People keep getting confused by how this works   so let me break it down for you.  Thanks for posting.

Just gather the votes.   How do their actions have anything remotely to do with racketeering  You can argue it  39 s monopoly abuse  but that doesn  39 t imply racketeering.  I d say more cartel behavior than racketeering  They  39 re not threatening to bankrupt them  they  39 re threatening to stop serving them as a customer. There are plenty of other hosting providers out there. If all alternative providers refuse to serve them  it either indicates that the companies are all participating in anti competitive collusion  or there  39 s something innate to all providers that deters them from wanting to sell services to parler. The former is criminal but seems unlikely. The latter is perfectly legal and very common.  Honestly AWS and others do have a point. Read some of the emails with Parler and they were slow to react with moderation.  i dont see how this is racketeering....  Day late and a dollar short you dumb fucks. You had the chance to put the leash on months ago. Good luck now  The left   quot ThErEs nO StAnDiNg quot   Yes  RICO the bastards   This would be a good case  but too many judges are crooked   quot No Standing quot   Absolute fk all will happen.. fk all these  quot investigations quot  just more political theatre.. whos gonna be held accountable  NOONE.  That will go absolutely nowhere with the Democrats controlling all 3 branches of government.  When it comes to the congressional Republicans  who I support  I ll believe it when I see it. They love to justly call out the big tech companies and call them before Congress in order to create viral moments. However  when it comes to actually doing something to stop them it s always an empty bag  This is such a text book example of anti trust law violations. All of these tech giants just happen to stop doing business with an upcoming competitor all at the same time  Give me a break.  I see downvotes.

Trump asked for using the law to  quot put down quot  rioters  violent protest  and insurrectionist for months. Trump put laws in place to protect monuments and offered assistance to stop violent protests.  Nothing happens in a vacuum  no matter how shortsighted people want to be  It s the question of  how long would you tolerate someone telling you to shut up when you re in a room full of people talking   Chances are you wouldn t last 4 years.  Well  if the left had actually held itself to its own standards we ve seen this past week maybe we could have avoided this riot. Instead we got  rioting is the voice of the unheard  for months and further escalation.  No you dont understand. Rioting is ok when I personally agree with it.  If you haven  39 t noticed the last 4 years that Democrats will do anything if they think it will help them politically. There is nothing they won  39 t do. Which is scary because they are going more towards communism and fascism as time goes on.  This is an important bfact that we need to understand soon. They have decided that the ends justify the means. They have decided that they are rightous and whatever they do to svheive their rightous goal for the betterment of all is acceptable  because they are going to gi e it to us weather we want it or not  Not that that makes it okay. We still need to hold ourselves to our own standards. What I resent is the implication that Conan the Barbarian guy represents the entire right  but BLM is  quot mostly peaceful quot .  I think it is a simple test of character.  If someone apologized for one set of riots and denounced the other they ve simply given themselves away as partisans.  Listen  you only get to have free speech if you agree with the narrative. They can and have banned a sitting US president.  I m kind of a hypocrite. I used to be so angry when I would see cities succumb to rioting because it hurt innocent people. And then nothing ever came of it to stop them or punish the people who encouraged and enabled it. Governments catered to the demands of protestors who damn near always had a riot attached to any gathering. Big tech gave endowments  and politicians and their aides helped spring people who rioted.   Yep.  It  39 s real hard to feel bad about it  even though intellectually I understand it was politically foolish and in general I disapprove of riots.  DC painted Black Lives Matter on the street in front of the White House and named a plaza after them.  It is incredible that the mayor of DC Muriel Bowser found her fake indignation over what happened.  Yea  It s not like they normalized mob riots this year or anything  s  Lol at Carmen Best defending BLM  the same group that defunded her and forced her out of her job.   Don t they know that you aren t allowed to think critically and connect dots  Left normalizes rioting and violence for a whole summer. Not a single Democrat denounced the White House riot that burned monuments and injured 50 Secret Service agents. Nope  they have no blame in normalizing that type of behavior in the U.S.   Yes  the far left is partly to blame. It  39 s their double standards that made this happen. Their complete disregard for voter fraud and irregularities no matter who wins the presidency. The fact that they have the MSM and social media giants to help them is what made this.  More than partly. they are the ones with hateful rhetoric. Notice too after the capitol incident  instead of talking about how sad the deaths are  Hillary is trolling trump on twitter  talking about how he can  39 t tweet anymore.  The police union pres didn t say anything incorrect  going against the lefty mindcontrol

I remember the internet 20 years ago. It had so much promise.  They made China proud  DELETE THEM ALL.  At this point the only thing that could stop these monsters is the San Andreas fault line
t3_kuggey,Mexicos President Blasts Twitter amp Facebook For Acting Like Holy Inquisition In Censoring Trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuggey/mexicos_president_blasts_twitter_facebook_for/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  rel  nofollow  https   discord.gg conservative  a   No  r  politics told me this is a good thing.   quot Seeing all these massive multinational corporations acting in tandem to enforce their will upon the world makes me so happy  quot  A self avowed leftist.  Love how they also claim to be against big business at the same time.  Didn  39 t work for the CEO of Goya...  Goya MADE money from all that attention... I even made a point of buying some more of their products. I am not seeing  the downside  if that is what you are inferring.  No not a downside at all.  Didn  39 t prevent the SJWs from going after him though.  Same with Chic fil a...  most profitable fast food chain and look at all the crap thrown at them.  Ah  yes. Good point. They did try to drag them both through the mud... what a spectacular backfire     Who said that  That  39 s uh...crazy  especially for a leftist  someone who almost certainly rails against corporations on the reg.   removed   What s the end game for us conservatives  It is apparent that any dissent from a liberal view is being censored and removed from the most popular form of communication. I see a lot of complaining and memes but no real plan for the future. How exactly are we going to get our message to undecided voters in 2022 2024    I have found that it seems to come from a naive notion that who is right  and who is wrong is trivial to determine. So you just ban the wrong person. So yes  teens and 20 somethings who have no clue about the real world. I would also add no intellectual humility.  The problem is they were taught from the womb that freedom of expression is more valuable and correct than freedom of thought and speech. It s OK to say you re a woman when you re actual a male  but to say that saying that is maybe a mental health issue is considered  hate speech.   When you tear out a man s tongue  you re not proving him a liar   You re saying you fear his words      They were taught that tolerance means that you must be affirmed instead of simply tolerated.  It s a free market thing  Well see  he incited a terrorist group to try to overthrow democracy. He totally done it. Don t even look into it  Is this what the voices told you   It was a joke. That s the point haha  Sorry  I shouldn  39 t have assumed.  When Mexico cares more about freedom than many lawmakers in the US do...  Well technically this isn  39 t government silencing the voice of opposition.  I don  39 t think it  39 s illegal either.  Glad I don  39 t have a Twitter account though.  I think they shouldn  39 t do what they are doing.  If you have a Twitter account and disagree with a Twitters policy or action I suggest deleting your account in protest along with Facebook.  It s not illegal  but I definitely think it s ripe for criticism  Well then let s remove section 230 from the law protecting them. If they want to regulate what is on their platform  Do so. But let s not give them immunities when they pick and choose what s allowed to stay or not stay  President Trump wanted to do so yet only a  few in Congress were brave enough to stand with him   It s nothing about bravery and all about that      And control.    Because reforming 230 would do more good than eliminating it. That would be my guess. But definitely bunch of RINOs in congress angway.  I  39 m not sure how a libertarian would rather hold the corporations accountable for actions of individuals.  Oh I did drop Fecalbook  Twatter  The Gram... all quite awhile ago.  I saw the writing on the wall way before this.  Me too. I was banned from Twitter almost 2 years ago. I quit Facebook Instagram  and pretty much everything else  over a year ago. I never used TikTok  WhatsApp  or anything Apple related.   I ve heard of Gab.  Going to check it out     Fortunately  these guys are not on any app store. They were attacked by big tech in 2018. They vowed they would not be silenced  amp  built their own servers and platform.   Hey thanks    I can  39 t find it on the android store  What  39 s the icon   I just pissed myself    Fecalbook    I ve heard ppl call it Farcebook too    Naw you had me at fecalbook let  39 s not ruin a good thing     Twitter and Facebook were both funded with government seed money. Along with google. Where  39 s the line between private and public   I don  39 t have an issue with those platforms banning people they don  39 t like. I have an issue with those platforms going after other platforms and forcing them to shut down bc people they don  39 t like use them.  Nice quote. Truman is my favorite president.     That s pretty sad  isn t it   This is an example of a rarity. Big tech  figuratively  owns most of the world. They could seriously fuck up his life.  I like AMLO. Hasn t been the boogeyman the corporatists in Mexico made him out to be.  They only said that because he was willing to go toe to tor with the cartels  who hold major power I Mexico. From what I  39 ve heard  limited since the media doesnt talk about Mexico much   he has been a very good president for Mexico. And yes  he has brass balls.  Go toe to toe  He  39 s been criticized for his peaceful approach to the cartels.  quot abrazos no balazos quot  hugs not bullets lmao  You can stand up and fight against something without literally sacrificing half your countries military and police force  since that s what it would take to forcibly remove the cartels  How else would you stop the cartels though  Think about that. Legalizing drugs is only going to make a tiny dent to be their business operations. Legalizing drugs would  39 ve made a serious impact in 80s or 90s but not no now.  Drugs are the lifeblood of the cartels. The sums of money involved are unfathomable. Organized crime would no doubt continue to exist and operate but the scale of corruption would drop dramatically.  Like I said  that would  39 ve worked in the 80  39 s or 90  39 s. The drug cartels are at a point where they  39 ve diversified their sources of revenue. They  39 ve entered the sex trafficking business  stealing natural resources and other things.  Legalizing drugs would just make the drug cartels a legitimate business. They  39 ll be the ones making money off of all the legal weed shops and suchlike. People don  39 t realize how deep the corruption goes down in mexico.  And if they somehow did end up losing money by selling drugs  they d just make up for it with more trafficking.  I  39 m not conservative  but you  39 re right. AMLO draws a lot of hate from the corporatists. But even the lower middle class. I have some wealthy friends in Mexico who hate him with a passion  understandably so  as his policies don  39 t help them. But even my less financially stable friends and family hate him  which makes no sense at all. One of them now has a pension  who under previous presidents did not. And another has medication who previously didn  39 t. Just mind baffling  I m sure it s similar issues here. Corporate media shitting on anyone who rocks the boat and actually cares for its people.  We are rightly being lectured about civil liberties by Mexico.   I jokingly told my wife we had arrived to the land of the free when arriving in Mexico recently. I feel economic freedom is great in America  but we live in a nanny state otherwise that doesn  39 t respect people enough to behave themselves on their own.  Corrupt countries are freer in many ways as long you can afford to purchase that freedom.  I think you make a valid point. I guess I am a bit jaded being from the land of laws for everything  California . It was until about a decade ago you could even enjoy a beer on the beach in my city  but some bad actors and a heavy dose of Nimbys got that banned as well. Certainly things like freedom of religion speech expression are more fundamentally important and significant. I just am saddened that In some ways I feel more free during my daily activities when I  39 m outside of the US at times.  Lol when Mexico knows we  39 re fucked  we  39 re fucked.  its upto the sane people of this country then to un fuck things.  When Mexico stands up for Trump  someone advocating building a wall  you know liberals are the real fascists  Absolutely. Curious to see their pitiful attempts at spinning the justification for Twitter and big tech on this one.  Based on their playbook they will either  Then three days from now they will say it s old news.  They ll say it s not real censorship  Even some people in here say that. But  you can t just say to start your own platforms if you don t like it. Look at what s happening with Parler.  Twitter is like cocaine.  It  39 s social media and very addictive.  If you start using cocaine it feels good and you want more.  You know it  39 s bad but you..... just....can  39 t....stop.....  I bailed a long time ago. I joined to follow some of my favorite F1 drivers  my favorite author  and a couple of other people. That placed might as well be called eCalifornia.  That  39 s word  It s a private company is a popular one.  Agreed it  39 s a private company but should not be protected under section 230.  Yup  and followed by comparing it to the mom and pop bakery refusing to bake a cake for a gay couple.  They aren  39 t private companies. They are publicly traded on the stock exchange  therefore  have shareholders.  Their shareholders could bring an antitrust lawsuit. Or  some other type of lawsuit.  They have  quot screwed the pooch quot   Fiduciary responsibilities would be the concern of the lawsuit.  Hmm I don t think their shareholders will but one can dream.  I was going to say I thought Mexico  39 s president was liberal so as the article suggests this is a pretty rate occurrence. I hope others speak up like he has  They only went after Trump now because he  39 s an easy target after everything that happened so I don  39 t expect people speaking up even though they should. It  39 s a dangerous precedent after all but people are either too scared or too shortsighted to say something.  Well  he also backed Trump when it came to election integrity and didn t go along with the Office of the President Elect Biden BS.  Looks like I ll be moving to Mexico soon  Guns are illegal  and if you have enough money to get something nice the cartel will sho up and just take it. If you express a problem about them taking your stuff they will just kill you and your whole family.  At least it s heavily conservative and catholic. two big wins  I also consider seriously to leave my country and even my continent Europe entirely in the next few years  due to lockdown mania. I would have considered the US states without much restrictions  like Texas  Florida or Arizona. But it looks like it could become worse with Democrats and Establishment Reps being in charge  who want a nation wide lockdown. I know the law normally prevents that  but we now know those now in charge try to act above the law and disregard it. If it were sure it will not happen and those plans will be shattered  then the free parts of the US would be really serious consideration.  The way things are going I can see the day where I have to at least leave my state Pa .  Nobody expects the holy inquisition.  Once our government can easily work with tech to suppress it  39 s own citizens  it will be child  39 s play doing it against other countries.  Corporate virtue signaling is what I see now. Companies just joining in so they won  39 t be called out as supporting Trump. They have to show they banned him to prove they didn  39 t support him  or risk the cancel culture coming their way.  the problem facing America is that large number of Americans do not actually believe in freedom.  I would say they don  39 t  em understand  em  freedom. They don  39 t realize that what gives them the freedom to  quot cancel quot  opposing viewpoints is the same thing that allows those opposing viewpoints to be heard.  I was taught from a young age  things like personal responsibility and accountability. Phrases like   39 I dont support what you say  but I will fight for your right to say ut.  39    39 Character is who you are when one one  39 s looking.  39  Innocence until proven guilty and the right to bear arms. Dont judge a person by the color of their skin but by the content if their character.      I always respect the logical views on both sides of the fence. I respect the Mexican president for this  a lot. Even Alex Navalny agreed on the same topic. However  the news isn t reporting his view much.   These  private companies  have huge lobbying operations and a revolving door of executives moving between them and Democrat administrations  the incoming worse than ever.  We are on dangerous path my friends.  To everyone calling President Trump a dictator  a dictator can t be censored   The one doing the censoring is the dictator   I ve told these clowns for years that if Trump was a dictator they wouldn t be allowed to speak out against him. Lol  They know this  the double speak is on purpose.  Its Psyops   quot I  39 m not hitting you quot  while they sitting on your chest wailing on your head.  Worst dictator ever   Lol.. yes true    I  39 m sure many of us will face a learning curve over the next four years what with the third world country we  39 re living in now.  quot Stand here  don  39 t write that  do this  don  39 t say that  and no soup for you  quot   Here  39 s the thing though  as much as I don  39 t like the idea of people being censored  a private company has the right to refuse services as long as it  39 s not based off discrimination. So wouldn  39 t the real conservative position be being okay with twitter exercising their rights as a privately run company   Yes it is true. However the concern is that they now hold so much power over people and corporations. To me this is an example of when the gov needs to regulate capitalism  like what happened at the turn of the last century with monopolies in food and steel. Social media giants own monopolies on public opinion now and they need to be dissolved.  The bans are overly broad. William F Buckley believed certain kinds of people  em should  em  be excluded from civil society  but this largely feels like an effort to silence conservative voices more than it is a genuine attempt to deplatform views beyond the pale.  You  39 re right  as evidenced by the fact that  WalkAway has been banned. That organization is just a collection of people who left the Democratic party and their testimonies.  When a leftist leader of a borderline 3rd world country is getting worried over how American Democrats are acting that is a tell tale sign that they  39 ve gone way too far.  It would be nice if more leaders had the balls to say things like that.  The Inquisition had NOTHING on what Communists are capable of.  I ve increasingly thought that if I were a leader of another country and I saw all this go on in the US  my response would be to declare these companies a non state actor and security threat and then either ban them outright or begin taking steps to do so. This type of action is an existential threat in that they re non state actors with more power than elected officials in many cases  certainly with the power to ban elected officials from something approaching the equivalent of the public square and clearly with the ability to bend and distort reality. That power is pretty significant and carries significant threat as we ve seen. I suppose I m just musing but I ve gotten where the words don t mean much without corresponding action. I appreciate he s willing to say this but if he doesn t do something  it doesn t appear as much more than empty words.  I predict another  quot cleansing quot  of a country  39 s leader.  Sold all my Facebook holdings since 2014  no interest being associated with where things are going to go next  I have a much more positive opinion of the inquisition than of twitter  That  39 s good to hear  I honestly can  39 t stand how people are celebrating this.   removed   Lib Media       removed   But it scared their politicians  how dare they   Plus they didn  39 t exactly make it hard to get in. Only first wave of people that pushed their way through should be considered rioters. Most people were just walking around.  No fires  no widescale looting. A laptop  some tchotchke  these people were pikers compared to BLM. That bunch would have left the Capitol looking like the German parliment after the Reichstag fire.  Are we not gonna mention the cop who was crushed to death    The strangest  maybe even funny  picture I saw was the one of the  so called rioters  staying calmly inside the velvet walkway inside the capital.  Would BLM Antifa respect the visitor tourist walkway partition    Well they keep calling it a  quot coup quot  or an insurrection  when it  39 s clear it was not an organized movement. Most of the people that went in did so because they were let in by the Capitol police as nonviolent protestors. There were only a small handful of people who had delusions of grandeur to take hostages and crap  and who were getting riled up with emotion.  road to communism  Uh oh. What the hell is Twitter  Facebook  and Amazon supposed to do now  Someone with more privilege points than them has expressed concern for the situation. If they don t listen to them and change  they will be racist. That s the rules that those idiots play by.  Ban Twitter and Facebook in your country before it happens to you  Mexico  39 s president recognizes fascism... why can  39 t Democrats   Kind of sad even Mexico realizes this is an assault freedom of speech but America can  39 t.  Look. I  39 ll admit  I  39 m not a perfect man. I have biases  and flawed opinions. I  39 m only 29.  Agreed but I still don t care for AMLO.  Abrazos no balas  is perhaps the dumbest thing I ve ever heard a politician of a country with a violence problem say to address the violence in his country.  You know you fucked up when Mexico is on Trump  39 s side lol  Stability of America is important to them  Did anyone else see this at the top of  a href   r all  rel  nofollow  r all  a  then suddenly be removed from the front page entirely   Wow... the admin mods active censoring  not surprised one bit   When are Iran  39 s terrorist leaders and ANTIFA getting banned  Never   Seriously you expect Hypocrisy to be a ethics problem to Leftists     Hacer grande a M xico de nuevo   MMGA     Jesus. When even the President of a 3rd world country sees the problem  you know it  39 s bad.

t3_kv7tqk,Manchin Changes Tune on DC Puerto Rico Statehood,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv7tqk/manchin_changes_tune_on_dc_puerto_rico_statehood/,I support PR statehood insofar as the people there want it.  It  39 s their right to join the Union instead of just being a colony   self determination and all that.  However  I vehemently disagree with any push for DC to be a state.  Those who suggest something that idiotic need to reread the Constitution.  DC is supposed to be separate from all the states by design.  Its only purpose is to be the seat of the government  not as a normal place for people to live.  Anyone who thought he would keep the Dem  39 s in check  he  39 ll be another sellout just like the rest of them.  How is that changing his tune   Hes basically saying the same thing he said before  he doesn  39 t know enough about the situations and would listen to the debates.  We should be pushing to grant puerto rico independence. Nothing but a money pit looking to be supported by the United States. Time to treat them like a 35 year old snow flake living in their parents basement and cut them off.  I mean he pretty much said the same thing in both interviews cited in that article. I hope he sticks to his word on the filabuster and courts though.  Even assuming we somehow manage to have free and fair elections in this country again  we are SCREWED if this happens. That is 4 more Dem Sens. Bye bye Senate in our lifetime.   Granting them   Do these people not understand that the constitution plainly lays out the path to statehood and they don t have votes.  They can t just  grant  anything...  He probably knows this would never get past the state legislatures anyway.
t3_kv1mpk,Former Secretary of State Colin Powell declares himself no longer a Republican following the MAGA Capitol attack and calls on Trump to resign,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv1mpk/former_secretary_of_state_colin_powell_declares/,Powell wasn  39 t really a Republican to begin with.  Came here to say that  Same here  He  39 s as Republican as Romney.

Goodbye   He  39 s only ever been a member of the Raytheon Lockheed Party  He was a republican   when politically convenient. like most neocons.  I would say yes  but as we all know not all republicans are conservative.  He hasn t been a Republican for years  Him and people of his ilk were basically honorary Democrats under the Republican banner. I wish more of these fake Republicans would finally admit they  39 re not in the party.  Another spineless coward joins the other side...  Republican Party is a big tent catch all party. Religious people  business people  gun owners  some Libertarians  etc. It  39 s kind of a mess. Saying  quot I  39 m a Republican quot  means fuck all nothing. I joined the GOP a few years ago so I could have a say in my states  39  primaries. If you say  quot I  39 m a Republican quot  I might be able to guess where you stand on a third of the issues.  No surprise... he was a RINO that was constantly sliding towards full liberalism  The dude has 2 weeks left  and has said he doesn  39 t support the Capital attacks. What more do you want from the dude   The Dude have a 75mil followers  many of which are gun owners. So they want him to disappear. Preferably  cursed by his own supporters.  This Globalist hasn t been a republican since the Iraq war.  Gee  next thing ya know McConnell  Graham  Rubio  and all the Bushes are going Democrat.  Shocker  I am shocked.    Buh bye   Don t let the door hit your ass on the way out   I always thought he was a Democrat anyway.  Oh  blow it out your Colin.  Damn. Was he still pretending to be a Republican  Could have fooled me.  Oh no  a rino comes out of the closet... inform the queen   That POS hasn t been a Republican since I was in diapers
t3_kulxor,I wonder if Alexandria OcasioCortez will be banned from Twitter and expelled from the House of Representatives for inciting violence. Im guessing she wont be.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kulxor/i_wonder_if_alexandria_ocasiocortez_will_be/,Trump said he  39 s not attending the inauguration  Clearly  this is an incitement of violence and he deserves to be permanently banned.   Bunch of jackasses.  I guess the donkey symbol is pretty apt then.  Twitter has been banning people who post that screenshot. They want to memory hole it.  Didn t she ask them to do that   No idea  I just know people who  39 ve posted it on twitter and either had it deleted  or been banned.  Her handlers tried to get Twitter to make her old posts unsharable.  I m sure there are plenty of screenshots  I did my part by saving it to external storage in case it gets drastic.  Good man  What s the point of that  She could just delete them if she doesn t want them shared.  Plausible deniability. Deleting tweets makes it obvious a user is trying to hide something. Having Twitter hide the tweets could be rationalized in a number of ways as the info isn  39 t being  quot erased quot .  You thought a Democrat would be held responsible for their actions  That s so cute...  Or when Kamala posted a donations link to help bail rioters out of jail  Is that link still up   Maybe the q anon people can use it.  Lol   So  discomfort is a dog whistle for vandalism  arson  and violence  Perhaps it is time we stopped protesting in front of capitol hill and started protesting outside of these big tech companies corporate offices. Although I am against us making them feel  quot discomfort quot   I am all for us making them feel nervous by showing up in huge  peaceful numbers. I can almost guarantee that these protests will get all the media attention they deserve and on top of that it will make the local and federal governments show their asses by how quickly they deploy local law and federal resources at the problem. It will shine a spotlight on all the people who feel your right to exercise your first amendment rights should be squashed if your views do not agree with theirs.  You would think the Capitol riot was the only riot in the last 10 months given all the attention and condemnation it  39 s getting.  And that the officer that died in the Capitol riot was the only officer killed or injured in the last decade.  The death of this officer is heinous and unacceptable..    I do NOT condone the actions of the few hundred that caused all this..   Are we talking about the officer that killed himself or is this something different   No  that  39 s  D ifferent  Didn  39 t we have a thread on here already with AOC trying to get twitter to stop allowing Retweets of these tweets   Projection projection projection. That s all they got. When you re forced into a corner with evidence all you can do is accuse someone else of what you did so the attention can be diverted off of you  Hold on  are you saying  AOC is a.... Hypocrite  Whattttt    no way   Anyone with eyeballs and ears sees and hears the hypocrisy. Enjoy all the angry leftists in your DMs after posting this    First it was  quot you can  39 t be racist against white people quot   No because they don  39 t play by the same set of rules. For some reason we think calling out their hypocrisy is going to accomplish anything. We are playing by a ruleset they don  39 t and this is why we lose.  She is filth.  thats an insult to the word    39 filth  39   AOC is the Belle Delphine of politics  Democrat Privilege  You don  39 t understand  that  39 s the good kind of incitement.  Guys. Come on.   Nah  she  39 s on team fascist. She can  39 t be held accountable.  Nothing will happen to her because she is a Democrat.

t3_kukn5e,Candice Owens Sues Mark ZuckerburgFacebook,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kukn5e/candice_owens_sues_mark_zuckerburgfacebook/,Okay I let yall have 16 hours of no flair in here.  This is what our entire sub would look like without the flair only policy we are currently enforcing.  first non flaired thread     I keep on seeing non flaired  what does that mean   blessing from mods to post is flaired  So like being allowed to post  Sorry I  39 m new to this community and still learning  The problem is that for the past few months  this subreddit has received  strong HEAVY  strong  brigading. The easiest way for the mods to try and reign in the brigadiers is to turn flair only comments because in theory  flairs are only given once after approval from the mods after some post history here. On unlocked threads  I  39 ve seen several terrible comments posted directed to members of the community or the community in general  death threats and the like  before the mods could get rid of them  and this has been going on for a very long time. Just with all the craziness relating to the election and what not  almost every unlocked thread has been flooded with pleasant comments like that so the mods have had to lock almost everything to keep some semblance of order. It hasn  39 t worked completely because the flair system isn  39 t fool proof  but it has helped prevent total anarchy.  If I may  with this new change  how do individuals who more recently found this subreddit or lurked like myself find themselves a flair. I tried to comment earlier on the post about 1984 selling on Amazon and was recommending Fahrenheit 451  but I think it was removed since I don  39 t have a flair.  Hey  I really appreciate explaining it to me  thanks for the info  Moderators sometimes designate certain posts as  flaired only . That means members of this sub that have a track record of posting conservative posts and have asked for flair from them are allowed to post. All others have their posts removed from that thread.   Yeah  everything is flaired   I haven t been able to get flair because I can t comment or actively participate. I get the reasons behind it but man  I d like to contribute to SOME posts.   Thank goodness we can actually discuss things here on a non flaired thread. It  39 s dangerous to have a closed audience repeat back your biases.  Hi guys   Hopefully this means that the people doing the brigading are getting bored and I will finally be able to post on things again with my new account  I hate just being able to upvote against all the downvotes but I shall do my duty until I can comment properly again.  I was hoping someone would  but we all know it won t go anywhere with all of these idiot liberal judges who won t enforce our constitution.  You mean liberal activists. Not judges.   removed   You realize that facebook has special tax breaks that label is as a nonbaised platform for the public  if they want to censor a certain group they need to lose that status.  Bingo.  These are civil suits  not criminal so the constitution doesn  39 t apply.  Private companies should be accountable to their shareholders and whomever the enter into contracts with.  An argument can be made that there  39 s and implicit contract to fairly enforce terms of service.  I agree that it is not a first amendment issue  but it is censorship  and censorship is bullshit  especially the way they stuck it all the way up the president and parler  39 s asses. People getting fired for showing up to a protest  on the other hand  that HAS to be a constitutional issue. I mean shit  can a company that hates nascar fire an employee for going to a race  Or can a company that hates the Dallas Cowboys fire an employee that goes to cowboys tailgates   Read the first amendment  it s not.  Most states can fire you if they don t like who you are.  It s something conservatives fought tooth and nail for.  Called  at will employment  states.  You re mad at something conservatives have fought for over decades.  Trump just put in over 250 judges and 3 scotus. Wtf r u talking abt.   removed   The tons of activists that remain at the district and court of appeals level.  Yeah all those.   They want to silent us   Was this created by Americans   That specific sentence  most likely not  Oh finally I can speak  for some reason I can never get a flair so I  39 m stuck just lurking on this sub.  Well considering I have no record of a modmail from you requesting one that probably has something to do with it.  Probation should be longer and always under scrutiny. Rules...without them we live with the animals.   removed    removed   I might switch to Elon musks star link  and I don t like the guy  but he s not gonna allow this crap  Since banks are already thinking to ban people based on political opinions. I would say in a few weeks.  I guarantee executives from other Internet dependent companies will be reviewing the AWS risk. Amazon suddenly deciding to jettison a client so publicly is a stupid PR move.  No  they won  39 t. Most companies don  39 t have a platform which allows political exchange. Most companies stay way from politics.  I vehemently disagree with your last sentence.  and I do declare that we can agree to disagree.     Cheers  happy cake day  Parler is politics. If it were only politics I  39 d be inclined to agree with you. But once Big Tech flexes its muscles it will no longer need to be only politics.  There are different types of  quot Big Tech quot . The Social Media  quot big tech quot  and Server hosting  quot big Tech quot  are one of them. The stuff that happened on parler directly led to the storming of the capitol. All parler needs to do is to remove any message which directly incites violence on someone. Go to  a href   r ParlerWatch  r ParlerWatch  a  and see the deranged idiots who literally fantasize about killing people. Parler went full free speech absolutist. Total free speech is a double edge sword and companies can be sued if their platforms promote such activities. AWS is protecting its ass at the moment. If another violent event happens at their watch  then there will be lots of lawsuits coming for them.Server hosting big tech is dominated by AWS  almost 40  of all websites are hosted on their datacenters and more than 50  of total amazon profits comes from aws.  AWS will not give a shit until your platform is literally used to kill people. Thats their bare minimum. They have given multiple notices to Parler before to regulate content to not have any sort of threatening speech or violence. But the edge lords at Parler didnt give a shit and this happened now. They underestimated the derangement of their lunatics. It is not about politics bcos national enquirer  who tried to show dick pics of Bezos  is also hosted at AWS. The bare minimum they needed to do is to ban speech which incites violence and they didnt do it.I am part of the Tech ecosystem and it isn  39 t all black and white as all people on both sides of political spectrum think it is.  I read here on Reddit yesterday that Parler took down posts from Lin Wood. So I don t think it s really true free speech.  Should we deplatform reddit too  Got to  a href   r shitpoliticssays  r shitpoliticssays  a  to see for yourself.  Absolutely agree. Still don t understand why the fuck they removed them.  Money  it  39 s always money.  We  39 re all friends of an open market here  so I don  39 t understand the reasoning behind that when anyone can start a new business. Trump can do it if he is as rich as he said  he might have something running soon.  Hipocrisy is the problem.. they let leftist terrorists do as they please  Fact Check is now synonymous with propaganda.  I  39 m glad. He needs to get Zuccked.   I love how we have smart  persuasive and Powerful people like this on our side. I hate when we get labeled with being ignorant or stupid by the liberals.  Can we all agree that Facebook losing to Candace Owens helps everyone   Go get them Candice     Candace Owens 2024     I would 100  vote for her  She speaks the truth. Hypothetically  let s say she wins. Even though the Left should be happy with a black female president  they would still hate her because of her beliefs. More reason for her to become a candidate       Heck yeah     lol  It s a private business  they can refuse service to whoever they feel has violated their TOS. It s pretty simple.  Aahhhh remember the baker with the gay couple  Well thats not what the left said then  Colin Kaepernick tweeted and I quote  when civility leads to death   which it didn t  but that s a different matter   The cries for peace will rain down  and when they do the will fall on deaf ears  because your violence has brought this resistance   While morally disagreeable  that still doesn t mean it s illegal. Again  it s a private company  they can choose to not host right wingers just because they feel like it. Remember the wedding cakes  Same shit.  Good luck  it  39 s a private company. Maybe use the post office.  Its a civil suit. She can do what she wants and there is precedent to support us.  No one  39 s suppressing free speech here. Say anything you want to anyone who will listen. No one is being charged for saying stupid shit. Private companies just don  39 t want to broadcast your stupidity.  If that  39 s what you think then that  39 s what you think  its not like your comments gonna change anything but you do have the right to make one  Unless the mods add a flaired users only tag. Which is their right to not let me spout what I  39 m sure they think it  39 s stupidity on their sub.   What about BLM  Many people dead  lots of damage in property and so much more  I don  39 t know what you  39 ve been keeping up with but I  39 m just sharing this  not here to debate  you have the right to your own opinion and I respectfully disagree with your last statement  What was Trump suspended for  Serious question.  Originally he was suspended for posting a video saying  quot the election was stolen from me  and it  39 s outrageous but please go home now. P.S. I love you riotous bbs quot . And a tweet saying  paraphrasing   quot this is what happens when you mess with patriots quot    I just love her  Holy hell in a hand grenade  this chick talks like she  39 s trying to brainwash a classroom full of pre schoolers.  Ha ha   What was it conservatives said when those people wouldn t make the cake for gay couples  But now Twitter  AWS  Facebook  Apple etc MUST allow you to spread your lies because you like the products  LMFAO. You tough guy conservatives better learn to code      Go tell that to Candice  she  39 s the one sueing  I wasn  39 t making a statement just sharing.  Yup   just keep amplifying the nonsense because  it s just our viewpoint . The current conservative element has gotten a very twisted view on current events and has forgotten a lot of what they ve been saying the last four years. Sounds very  snowflake ish  to me... it was all valid until an attempted coup occurred. Liberals aren t typically these flag waving  patriots    but you know what   we love America. We ve spoken and used our votes... by mail and early because we take the virus seriously. Not because we think we re all going to die from it   it s to keep the healthcare system with capacity for all medical emergencies. This all stems from a lying president and his enablers amplifying information like the election was rigged   then saying  hey these people are upset because they believe the election was rigged  without owning that they are the ones who put that out there   FALSY and with bad intent.   Good for her   We need Candace right now.  Hell yes.  Maybe she can find a few more media companies to sue  I would love for her to be the first black female billionaire president.  Candace Owens is my hero  Psssst....the crooked Leftist judges are in on this.  Did you mean the leftist judges trump appointed  Or the ones bush appointed  Or the ones Obama had blocked  I  39 ve been a proponent of free speech for as long as I can remember  but I never thought I would see this level of censorship in my own lifetime. It is utterly disgusting. And the concerted hit job on the president  his twitter fb ig  plus his shopify store and his email  and they shit they did to parler is only the beginning. Maybe it  39 s time to start writing pamphlets and using mail  I don  39 t know  but I am pissed and disillusioned all at once.  Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences. If you spew hateful and ignorant garbage and incessantly spread lies and disharmony  people don t have to give you a platform or keep you around. No one is entitled to force others to listen to their opinions. You have free speech  but there are consequences that everyone needs to accept.   This comment has been flagged for disinformation pertaining to free speech   You  39 re the one who doesn  39 t understand free speech. All free speech does is guarantee you immunity from legal prosecution from voicing your opinion. It doesn  39 t  em entitle you  em  to the ability or right to voice your opinion on any platform. It just protects your right to do so if and when you do.  Then repeal section 230 protection. If Twitter wants to play thought gods then they shouldn t be protected as some sort of neutral platform. If they are deciding actively what is posted and what isn t then they should be held accountable as any other publisher would.   This comment has been flagged for disinformation pertaining to free speech    quot Flaired users only quot  is a tag on 99  of posts on this sub  it  39 s pretty clear you guys don  39 t believe all free speech suppression is a bad thing lol  Take that up with the mods  I m not a mod.   I understand  and I m not totally arguing with you on that. I m however not a mod and not in a position to argue why that rule exists tbf  I  39 ll help you out. It  39 s because they are suppressing opposing voices. Hypocritical  If someone wants to come here and get informed or enter civil discourse  that s totally fine and should be allowed. I think what the mods are doing is to prevent the irrational idiots coming in here telling people that they should be dead or should have been aborted  like some of the messages I received in my inbox  You have no constitutional rights to shitpost on social media. That you THINK you do says a lot about your whole god damn bowel movement of a  party.  Free speech means freedom of expression  you pube. Tweeting or posting on IG   freedom of expression   free speech. How many times have you failed grade 2   You have no fucking idea what the constitution says. Its hilarious.  When you sign up for a Twitter FB Instagram account  you check yes on the Terms of Service that say they own your account and can do anything they want with it  including suspend it. The first amendment only protects your speech from the government  private platforms like Twitter or Google have the explicit legal right to deplatform anyone they want. Maybe Republicans shouldn  39 t have spent the last 40 years deregulating big business and screeching  quot but muh free market capitalism quot .  This for sure. If someone says something I don  39 t like  it  39 s my choice whether or not to get offended or worked up. It  39 s not up to me or anyone else in general to determine consequences for society.  Why do you on this sub shriek endlessly about freedom of speech while also only allowing  quot authorized users quot  to post and having mods ban anyone who speaks out against Dear Leader   What is the right consequence then   And you have no right to speak on a site like Facebook.  It s a privilege.  I suppose what I meant was  no one is entitled to force anyone to broadcast their opinions   better  Do you disagree   Yes. Yes I do.  You re totally ignoring that it s the result of the speech that is an issue   i.e violence  hate  and insurrection based on lies  not that people don t like it. No one should be forced to host those messages and those messages should be quashed because they result in unjust and harmful outcomes.  There is a big difference from just sayin shitty things and some people taking those words to do  quot violence  hate and insurrection quot  and inciting  quot violence  hate and insurrection quot .  In criminal law   strong incitement  strong  is the encouragement of another person to commit a crime.  Let the audiences users decide all of that. Are you disabled  you need social media sensors everything for you just bc you don t like it.  Uh it s not about not liking anything. I d hope most people wouldn t like someone spreading lies and misinformation and inciting violence. What I don t support is state actors hijacking private entities into their own propaganda networks and abusing both the platform and the public s trust.  Consequences should be for individuals with actual hate speech. You don t delete entire accounts and platforms because you don t like their view. And if we are deleting entire platforms for hate speech  Twitter and Facebook both need to be deleted for all of the hate speech flying around those platforms.  What is  quot hate speech  quot    a href  https   www.youtube.com watch v OhqB wjOI5M  Here  a  is real hate speech and AFAIK  that guy who told CNN they were gonna  quot Burn this bitch down quot  in Minneapolis hasn  39 t been brought up on any charges for inciting violence.  Maxine Waters saying  quot get in their faces  quot   ... and did Representative Waters face any consequences   No but she should have.  Agreed   Consequences should apply to any action that requires them. Hate speech is one example. Incitement of violence and insurrection is another. And that includes spreading lies about the legitimacy of our democratic process.  Like the Russian collusion BS.  Liberal judges refuse to hear the cases  that doesn  39 t mean it was a lie. That  39 s why we are angry.  I m a lawyer man  I followed the cases. I read the judges  opinions. I ve also written opinions for both state and federal judges so I know how it works. If the lawyers had the evidence the claimed to have they would have at least been able to proceed on a handful of their cases. Instead  the lawyers literally didn t even argue fraud and flat out said they had no evidence of fraud to present. Instead  they wanted to use technicalities to disenfranchise millions of voters like in PA. It was a ruse. You re parroting Trump talking points and I d wager you never even actually read the filings or the opinions.  Pennsylvania changed their voting laws without a vote.  That directly goes against pennsylvania  39 s constitution. It doesn  39 t get anymore clear than that man.  Apparently the courts and the PA government disagree. And apparently the Republican Pennsylvania legislature that changed the law didn t have a problem with it until their candidate lost. Even assuming that what you re saying is correct and true  which is disputed and most likely false   why should a court throw out millions of legitimate votes on a technicality  Isn t there a constitutional interest in not disenfranchising millions of legitimate votes   I  39 d venture to say this person wouldn  39 t even no what a filing or opinion is at it relates to the courts.  This is the left s favorite talking point now. They will come for your speech too  just wait. Will you chalk it up to consequences then   They don t even realize their confirmation bias. They agree with the agenda  so therefore there is no agenda. Until it happens to them...  It s not just the left man. I m an attorney  I have studied constitutional law. I do worry that the left will seize this weak point for conservatives and especially Trump and try to twist the knife and ban many actors. But I absolutely do not support Trump or Trumpism.   Facebook is a Bakery. Donald Trump is a gay wedding. Is that easier   Mmhm  sure  except that the gay wedding went to a different store that allows it but the first bakery and other bakery  39 s ganged up on the one bakery that allowed it and shut it down because it  39 s not like their bakery  39 s. Is that easier   The artisan bakery  39 s source of flour and yeast both refused to do further business with them  but they also sell cakes and breads directly to the consumers  in a bigger operation   She  39 s kinda a hack conman compared to Trump. Yet hey  if you  39 re dumb enough to give her   then have at it I guess.  America is full of suckers these days. So she preys on that for a living.   Did some researching on that site.  It s owned by Airwaves media which in turn is owned by Interflow group which is owned by Taher Khan.  He is a prominent figure in the Pakistani government which is extremely friendly with China.  In all honesty you probably just ran into what she described in her video.  False narratives and  fact checks  that are influenced greatly by the Chinese government.  Candace Owen  39 s is amazing  strong and brave  I appreciate her not backing down  She needs to go for the throat.  I would 100  vote for her for President.  How the hell can a company that actively and openly censors users for their own political benefits be considered a platform    I really hope she runs for President  one day  She s a legend   This post has been flagged for being incredibly based   Mods have a stickie at the top.  Outlined it.  They are kinda being harsh about it right now as we  39 ve been getting the brigade daily.  It was a lot more open before the election.  I  39 m slightly concerned with the barrier to entry for the conservative subreddit.  Can anyone genuinely explain it   Anyone have any idea on how successful she might be in this venture   She should have done this without asking for money. As things goes further she could ask for donations.  Christ  she is a complete airhead.
t3_kv21bq,Prosecutors weigh heavy hammer  felony murder  for rioters in Capitol officers death,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv21bq/prosecutors_weigh_heavy_hammer_felony_murder_for/,How about the people who killed people during the riots   Don  39 t you dare frighten politicians.. or sorry  Democrats. If this was a left wing protest and they were breaking windows in an attempt to intimidate Mitch MConnel the left would be celebrating them and the rioters would be slapped with trespassing and vandalism charges and even then they would be released with time served. That  39 s assuming any charges would be filed at all. Because resisting Republicans means resisting fascism.  Say her name.  Let s just amp up the tensions in America. Soon we will all forget how to spell much less say  unity .  They  39 ve been very vague about what happened to this officer   there  39 s still no direct cause of death attributed as far as I can tell. And that  39 s deliberate I think. If he was assaulted  then those responsible need to pay and depending on the nature of the assault I can  em maybe  em  see a murder charge sticking.   If he died due to rioters we would know. That would have been blasted everywhere. The fact that its being blasted in this  quot died  who knows why quot  context should tell you everything you need to know.  Threaten everyone  and their children  with sky high charges so they plea.  Exactly.  And most of them will not have the money to put forward an adequate legal defense.

What are we going to do about it   Don  39 t worry  they will have a list of every person who voted for Trump from voter rolls and start rounding us up  putting us in re education camps.   It ll just be a war of attrition on the constitution. Nothing is more disappointing than knowing your country was the worlds greatest then fell   not from external forces  but to internal globalists selling themselves to the external forces.   Oh yeah  it will absolutely be death camps.  Nazi did it and the CCP is doing it already...  I was only half serious but a few months ago I said it won  39 t be long until we can  39 t criticize Joe Biden  a sitting president  online without being censored. But now I am thinking that will actually become a reality.  The people of power cracking down on the opposition.  This is the night of broken glass Arnold.  Jan 7th.

I can t even access it right now.  You can say that with parler as well. Time for these two companies to get big boy servers  Well parlor is just fucked... so gab will sky rocket  Parler and Gab should merge.  They  39 re fighting the same fight.  It says  quot under maintenance quot  now  The left will never allow a communication platform to exist if they cannot directly control the flow of information  Don t worry big tech will take it down soon  They already tried due the the heavy white supremacy presence on the platform.  That is why gab is hosted with undisclosed company in some foreign dont give a crap country.  Well let  39 s invite the black supremacists  and the whatever the fuck else supremacists on too. They have just as much of a right to free speech too.  Firmly agree. Free speech is free speech. I don t care who says what to whom  I ll defend their right.  This didn  39 t use to be controversial.  Sad times.  Blackpeopletwitter would have a field day I am sure.  Let them. As long as its all kept legal.  Honestly I would pop some corn to watch the show.  Really  I ve honestly never heard of it till just now  I better get it before Apple takes it off the App Store  It  39 s all website or side load on Android.  They got pulled from the app stores a few years ago.  They could still go after their dns hosting  even sinkholing it at the root level.  There is still plenty of bullshit they could pull.  Then you go to an ip system websites work without dns  Without DNS you lose a ton of less savvy people  I  39 m not talking about normies I am talking about people willing to dodge cancel culture.  People will do anything if it involves their livelihood. I learned these simple skills by bypassing my middle schools ban for certain websites. I for one don t mind a little tweaking to access anything.  Haha yeah I remember being 13 and using proxy browsers to get onto Facebook on the school network  Wasn t it the greatest of times lol      Nor me  Sure but making that work for most people isn t feasible.  Along with that ISPs could start dropping packets to those IPs.  I guess you could vpn or use tor but again  that s not feasible for most users.  These days most websites seem to either outright refuse Tor connection or are maddeningly slow  Their CDN is Cloudfare  they may take it down  Sadly they  39 re just making themselves a target. They  39 re only going after Parler because it has a chance of being the Twitter alternative. They don  39 t want that.  Gab was the original  and Parler happened in response to Gab being kicked off of stores and hosts..  Yep and since they know AWS has it they will pressure it.  Making them the next target of the Left.  Free speech     Someone call the ccp and big tech immediately  Just tried to make an account and it s under maintenance. Lol. They probably weren t expecting this.  I managed to get on this afternoon     All I have to say is buy some puts in twitter Monday morning. That stock is gonna be toxic.  How much of their traffic the last 5 ish years was connected to Trump in some way  They killed their own Golden goose to virtue signal  After the Constitutional Restoration and destruction of the left  there will be a Trust Busted  set of companies maintained to help stabilize the addicted  for a generation until they can be weaned off that mindrot.  Gab.com is awesome   Slow right now but i was patient and got signed up. Great UI. Deleted all big tech b.s and sold all stock in them. Vote with your wallet friends.  They need to work on their layout  once they get the servers handled  cause that shit sucks.  It takes time to work out the bugs   thosen others have been at it for decades now    but shallower learnbing curve  utilizing that development  Yah  I get that. I was just saying it sucks.  yes it will and people best be making themselves ready for it

t3_kuoiks,Feds looking at declaring Proud Boys a terrorist organization in wake of U.S. rioting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuoiks/feds_looking_at_declaring_proud_boys_a_terrorist/,Proud boys are an idea  Haha.  But they won t classify Antifa as terrorists   FBI director says antifa is an ideology  not an organization  The FBI should be defunded  Along with a lot of other alphabet agencies.  That  39 s retarded  ANTIFA has an ideology  most organizations do  its an organization pushing an ideology  a Leftist  Progressive  Marxist  Social Liberal  Social Democratic ideology.  A week later he clarified and expanded on his earlier comments.  You can t classify an idea as a terrorist  Yet they ve had the most tangible impact with respect to violence and rioting.  I know lol I m just mocking biden  Biden is a terrorist.  Yes he absolutely is   I know     I  39 ll settle for BLM  the organization  BLM and antifa burning  looting  and destroying cities is fine.  According to that dip shit  Beau Of The Fifth Column. BLM and Antifa were justified in what they did because they were fighting against systemic racism. Everyone at the Capitol were simply doing it because they didn  39 t like the results of the election.  So imaginary systemic racism  gt  actual systemic corruption    Sure...  ok.  Look him up on YouTube and try to watch some of his video  39 s. I challenge you to not lose your shit within the first 30 seconds of his pseudo intellectual diatribe that boils down to nothing more than  quot Orange Man Bad quot . The mere fact that he has over 500K subscribers is truly a testament to how utterly stupid some people actually are.  Canadian Feds  What are they gonna do  refuse to say  quot sorry quot  to us   Might be the only terrorist group ever whose foundation is the idea that people should be proud of their country and should all be afforded unconditional freedoms.   Dude I m pretty sure every terrorist organization is centered around being proud of your country. That is literally the premise of groups like the IRA  So the key is to hate your country to not be classified as a terrorist    Were the revolutionaries were considered terrorists in 1776   By this metric  yes.  But the Proud Boys are white supremacists   He  39 s blacker than Talcum X  that  39 s for sure   Certainly backer than Harris tbh.  Soros didn  39 t like pride in ones country.. yah know because he helped the Nazis.. just as he is now...  This sub has become  a href   r politics  r politics  a . It s sad to see.  If Proud Boys is declared one   BLM must be declared one too.  BLM has done more damage  death  and crime than all.  How many innocent people have they killed   I thought le average redditor said you can  39 t designate domestic organizations as terrorist in response to Trump and Antifa.  If the left didn t have double standards  they would have no standards at all. Think Shapiro said that one.  Canadian Feds... if you  39 re talking about a US group at a US capital  and you just say   39 feds  39   you are misleading.  That doesn  39 t make any sense because the Proud Boys weren  39 t responsible for the rioting in DC.  I am okay with punishing the people responsible but punishing people who weren  39 t is both dishonest and politically dangerous.  We don t punish by group  legally. Individuals commit crimes.  This is a confusing response.  Targeting a group not responsible for the rioting makes sense to you   I m pointing out that if we start calling each other terrorists  the government party in power gets to decide who it is  and it won t be fair.  This is another confusing response.  If the government is pretending a group who aren  39 t terrorists are terrorists and using partisan differences as a reason to infringe on their rights that  39 s highly illegal and dangerous.  Whoosh  Then it went over your head.  It seems to me like you don  39 t think there is a difference in the government appropriately treating a group of terrorists as terrorists and the government inappropriately labeling a group that the political party in power dislikes as terrorists in bad faith.  I can  39 t disagree with your posts more if that  39 s what you  39 re trying to say.  This already happened. Two ranchers charged under terrorism statutes under the Obama DOJ  which led to a standoff. Remember   Okay  no wonder your responses were throwing me off you were thinking of these situations and not the one that was the catalyst to the one this article is talking about.     removed   There was a BLM activist guy  goes by John Sullivan.  He  39 s the one guy in the building itself I heard got released.  Don  39 t know if he damaged anything  but they went hard after the dude who just took a selfie and left a note on Pelosi  39 s desk.   removed   Why not just stop with all the foreplay and declare any individual or group that does not kiss the Democrat ring as terrorists    um  what  were they even at the capitol on Wednesday  I don  39 t understand... this is just a witch hunt of all groups to the right of ANTIFA at this point.  And they will get it done too  because the Left is more competent and ballsy than Trump  Antifa is going to be teaching your kindergarteners transgender issues at this rate.  Just remember.  Our founding fathers were considered terrorists to the powers that be of their time.   But they weren  39 t there.

Rid yourself. I thought the Democrat party hated spoiled rich white people who haven  39 t done a day of real work in their lives  No   I understand that but if you ask them  the rich should be eaten  pay their fair share and all that. Their words and actions don  39 t align.  That was a base of theirs for years. We are for the working people. Not anymore  but  that is what they campaigned on for years and years  You hit it spot on  For the last time  we do not care what Monica Lewinsky  39 s boyfriend  39 s wife has to say.  You are white. Let  39 s start with you.  Nice projection there  she  39 s the face of white supremacy...  How the hell doesn t voting for a certain person based on my political beliefs make me a white supremacist  biden literally coauthored a bill based around segregation and I m a white supremacist for voting against that lunatic   In college it was explained that being white  or even light skinned hispanic  middle eastern  etc  means you are a white supremacist.  Trash like that helps keep racism alive  I think that  39 s the point. What would they have to rally around if it ever truly left   How did the explain how other races stay roughly the same color too lol  Nothing to do with locality or genetic differences  Just inbreeding lol   When were you in college  if don  39 t mine me asking   That just shows their ignorance. I ve had my dna analyzed and you can see my genetic makeup is primarily from countries that are geographically close to each other  which makes perfect sense when you realize that travel wasn t always as east at it is today  Is this legitimately something you learned in a class  I mean  that genuinely doesn t surprise me even a little bit  just curious if this is actually the rhetoric on college campuses  It s leftist think. If you can t make sense of it  you re in good psychological shape.  What I really  really would like to know is...what is it going to take to rid us of the Clinton s   How does impeachment even equate to a hit on white supremacy  There  39 s no logical connection. Sounds like she really should be prescribed some better meds to counter the crazy.  It should also be noted that everyone keeps saying this impeachment is about insurrection yet she  39 s saying it  39 s about white supremacy. Usually they have their story straight and they all get the talking points. Maybe she got an old set of talking points.  Of course not.  We need to go further.  Start imprisoning for speech crimes.  Make white people more of the enemy.  She finally turning herself in for being too white   She doesn  39 t want to get rid of white supremacy  just Conservatives in general.  News flash Hilliot  Conservatives are all races.  Still a sore loser after 4 years. Locking you up in prison isn t enough for committing fraud on a fisa court.

t3_kv5k2c,Biden inauguration to unfurl under America United theme,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv5k2c/biden_inauguration_to_unfurl_under_america_united/, America United...but first after conservatives undergo liberal conversion therapy.   This fucking guy...lol  Unprecedented levels of  gaslighting.  Hahahaha in your dreams    quot America United quot    Half of America United    Here. I fixed it.  If the left wants us to unite  perhaps they should start without taking away our free speech across the country... Unite... what a joke  Also known as the  quot shut up and do what you  39 re told you disgusting prole quot  meme. There will be zero tolerance for non compliance. If you do  you  39 re an insurrectionist and a domestic terrorist. In fact  since silence is violence  failure to openly support Biden will result in your being designated a domestic terrorist.  Most Soviet Block puppet states were lead by one or another   39 United  39  party. USSR was a Union as well. When part of your party and supporters say about banning opposition or even participates in it and another talks about unification it is hard not to compare it to these times and organizations.  A fine example of the meaning of IRONY   Consider just some of the  strong  em very latest  em   strong  things Biden has said  forget about his comments going back 45 years. This is the unity president  We have a senile octogenarian sticking up for Black Lives Matter and criticizing Caucasians. Who on earth is  blackmailing this guy and what do they have on him.  The left is okay with big tech silencing republican voices and Biden thinks he s a uniter       Bwahahaha haha what an absolutely joke  Nothing like getting your leg pissed on and being told   Hey look  it s raining    I love how they are still trying to call us Nazis  Unity  because it works in North Korea   That  39 s spit take worthy. This guy is incapable of unifying his thoughts  let alone the country.  This is so fucking simple. Call out the capital rioters by name  call out antifa by name  then say that 99  of Americans hate BOTH of their fucking guts and that the radical nuts on both sides are anti american and can suck our balls.

t3_kuewa3,Report Pence Will Attend Inauguration,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuewa3/report_pence_will_attend_inauguration/,Lots of weird responses here. It is correct he attends. Biden is going to be the new president  like it or not. He was legally confirmed by congress so Pence is doing the right thing by respecting that. He is being a professional. Refusing to attend won  39 t solve anything.  The weird responses are part of the reason some of the center left has an issue with the right. There is such an ingrained notion of   39 all or nothing  39  when it comes to party loyalty and going with what your rep vp president says.  The party and Trump loyalty is absolutely disgusting. I  39 m a conservative  not a Republican.  He got.my vote... not my all.consuming fealty.  And the irony is that all the Trumpers are calling everyone who sticks with the constitution conservative values traitors.   The Left is actually very much the same in that regard. There s purity tests everywhere. It s so stupid  you shouldn t agree on every policy with practically anyone. It s inorganic and poisonous.  Yup  completely agree. That  39 s why I think the two party tribal system we have in place is stupid.  It is  but it massively benefits the elite class.  I  39 m not a conservative. I lean to the democratic side. I cannot express how important it is for us to remain logical like you are here. I don  39 t hate Republicans. I hate extremists  on either side.  Correct take. I m not looking forward to some of Biden s policies but it s time to move on. Biden is the next presidents and we should show him the courtesy and respect that befits the inauguration. Before anyone says  but Dems didn t     yes  and I criticized that and find it to be negative behavior.   God it s so refreshing seeing sane responses to this compared to what you see on thedonald  I feel kinda bad for the guy at this point. Trump put him in a really tough spot by challenging his loyalty at the 11th hour. Questions about the integrity of the election aside  he did the right thing then and he  39 s doing the right thing now.  Trump completely threw him under the bus by putting him in a no win situation. Our Republic seems sick and dying  and asking Pence to go against 200  years of custom to make a move of questionable constitutionality would have only damaged it further. There were bigger issues than a single president.  I agree. Even as a Trump fan who voted for him in 2016  2020 and would vote for him again   I can  39 t say I  39 m pleased with his decisions in his last few weeks in office  and I can only imagine they were made because of his inability to accept defeat.  What the hell happened to this sub  Used to have pretty reasonable discussion  now it  39 s whiney Trumpists sad that they lost their election. Hopefully all these Trump worshippers go away after he gets the boot.  r T D got shutdown and they came here it s not that hard.  It  39 s sad. I wish they would follow up and all go to Parler lmao.  Guys I don t think that he s wrong here. Pence is a consummate politician  and he s also a really classy guy. He wasn t attacked with the same level of vitriol Trump was  he got the slightly upgraded call all conservatives are bigots  Democrat line. It makes sense for him to attend. Personally I don t think Trump should  but I think it s good that there s someone from the administration who is. Pence isnt a traitor. He didn t have the power to turn away the electors. Trump was wrong to tweet about pence the way he did  the guy has been incredibly loyal to the President  Pence is taking into account what if he wants to run for president in the future as well.  I think as a person  Pence would be a good president  I don t think pence would be electable. He comes off as such an earnest nice intelligent guy  and although I don t think he would be ruffled at all by hysterical Democrats  see the VP debate   his personality doesn t appear to have the strength To be heard over the mob.  The time of Pence s type being President has come and gone I think. I think he would make a great conservative President  and I would vote for him  but I don t think he d fit in today s political climate. Maybe he ll prove me wrong  No  I totally agree with you. 10 years ago  he would ve been great  but you re right  the temperature is too high for such a calm dude  He was the perfect offset from Trump  and added calmness to the administration. Hopefully he finds somewhere to make an impact on the future  Oh  I was drinking during that debate  and it was epic. He wiped the floor with her. Pence was the perfect choice  and my only wish is that he would have been more prominent in the last four years. Like  what is Pence had had a Twitter that repeat it trumps words in a more palatable way  What is Pence gave more political speeches and was out in public talking. What if they tagteam to the social media  so that the important things that needed to be bombastic came from Trump  and the important things that need to actually be understood by the American people came from Pence  I wonder if there would have been any difference. I think that the moderate contingency that couldn t hold her nose and vote Trump might have been swayed if Pence has been used more often and affectively  I agree  although I haven t seen much of Pence  I think he would ve helped balance out Trump s fierceness  and they would ve been a great team.  I think he  39 d be great  but what it ultimately boils down to is that Democrats and the media are obsessed with hating on white religious people.  There is no world  not right now  where a white religious conservative doesn  39 t immediately get tagged as anti women and anti minority.  Facts and their record don  39 t matter.  They will run headline after headline of opinion pieces trotted out like objective journalism saying how bad they are and the average moderate voter will only hear that.  Only conservatives hear conservative media and even moderate conservatives don  39 t consume it regularly.  This last election proved it  the only way conservatives can win is if we attract moderates from both sides of the isle with good policy.  White college educated men voted for Biden because they were convinced to some level that he was a white supremacist.  They will trot this out on every white candidate.  Hell  they tried to jump that shark with ACB and she has two adopted children that aren  39 t white.  Agreed. He would make a good president but he would suck at running for president.  He  39 s the perfect VP if you think about it.  It s a damn shame too   he showed in the veep debate that he was by far the most qualified  intelligent  and in touch person for the presidency out of the 4  Like Ross perot  He looks like he can melt in with America s working class... not.  Absolutely non electable.  He sure wouldn  39 t get my vote anymore  I personally think he s very electable and I would love to seek him debate at the presidential level.  He comes off weak to the coastal right. Maybe could get support from middle America though because he does come off as nice but not someone who you want fighting for you  I agree. It will be hard for him to run as it seems like he has mixed feelings from republicans after last week  With the split the republican party has  I don  39 t think he would be elected. He  39 d be the best candidate but you got the radical right that don  39 t want him.  I think he has some questions to answer about this whole time period and what he really believes.  An accounting.  I don  39 t think it has to be a trial of any sorts... i  39 m of the  quot agree with trump but hate his tact with the burning of 1000 suns quot  but I have questions about Pence and where he actually stood on things and why.  TBF we don  39 t usually ask much about the VP  39 s beliefs so this is pretty common. I  39 m not a fan of how he handled handled some things in Indiana  but I  39 m sure there  39 s more to him. Unfortunately  I don  39 t know how he can escape from the Trump affiliation at this point.   deleted   I think if I was him I d ride into the sunset.  Pence is in a no win situation. Either he doesn t attend and gets scorched in the media as  no better than Trump   or he attends and has to sit there quietly while Biden shits all over him and Trumps legacy the entire time while simultaneously calling for  unity  conveniently forgetting to acknowledge his parties antics over the past 4 years.  As gracious as England and the rest of the world acknowledge Argentina s right to raise the trophy after the World Cup win 1986 after the hand of God goal.  Well said. If the conservatives ever want to have a voice in government  we have to become smarter at playing the game. Right now the Democrats are successfully dividing us. This is the time to unite and fight back  not physically fight . While some Republicans are betraying us  we should try to primary them out of office  not destroy the party because we don t like them.  This is my biggest fear and I couldn t believe the division even on this sub in the last week. A lot of people saying they will never vote for a Republican ever again  which doesn t exactly help keep socialism and leftist policies at bay.  It is more than a little disconcerting to see so many responses that Pence is somehow a traitor for doing his job  more so from so called conservatives.  Trump should suck it up and attend but if he won  39 t Pence should take it up.  Has the media been unfair to Trump in the four years   Absolutely.  However that doesn  39 t excuse what happened in the capitol or Trump  39 s behavior since the election.  My mother was always fond of a saying  quot if we don  39 t behave any better we aren  39 t better. quot   If we give up on that  we  39 re just reduced to power politics and the Republic will not survive.  pence is probably the only person tied to trump thats going to come out of this whole thing better than when he went in. he seems pretty solid imo  Hopefully.  I have a feeling Trump is going to declare him the enemy and ask what strong supporters he has left to not support him in anything he might do  Pence is a man of dignity I would like to see carry the mantle... depends on where the Republicans go in the post Trump era  Trump attending probably does a bit more harm than good  although I really do think he should respect that Biden has been elected president in one way or another. I doubt he s going to change his tune  unfortunately.   Similarly to Ben Carson  Pence would be a good conservative president  imo.  I was on a media blackout this week due to really heavy personal stuff.  You picked a crazy week to tune out. I  39 m typing on a phone  so I  39 ll try to give you the short end of it.  Excellent  I  39 m actually happy that he will.  I think that would be the right move. Civility  gracious behavior cannot be overstated.  I support Trump as much as anyone but it was unreasonable to expect Pence to be   39 the hero to save the second term of the Trump Presidency  39 ...he  39 s just a tool placed in to ensure the RNC  39 s interests were maintained in the Trump administration.   Isn  39 t the inauguration going to be virtual   Its over guys.  The left is in charge.

Murkowski has been pissed that she lost the primary 4 years ago and knows that she has no chance being reelected in 2022 as a Republican. She is desperately trying to manufacture a post Senate career in the MSM as a female version of Joe Scarborough.  Murkowski will definitely be changing parties soon.  I guess Lisa is going through an existential crisis...she doesn t even know if she s Republican anymore... s  Murkowski was never a Republican.  Nor has she ever won a legitimate election.

No one deserves to be locked up with Cuomo.  What about the other Cuomo   Cuomo  39 s in Custody.  The alliteration is astounding   quot Cuomo  39 s in Custody quot  now that  39 s tv show that deserves an emmy.  Nah just fine Cuomo for every wasted vaccine. That would fix the problem quickly.

Of course he  39 s slow walking the vaccine rollout. Covid is the best thing that ever happened to him. He was given absolute power and has been fawned over by the slobbering media. Hell  he won an EMMY for his propaganda broadcasts. He never wants this to end.  Sounds like he needs another emmy    removed   What if that accidentally turns him into a super villain  I think he already is that to New York and it s people  I  39 m starting to think Cuomo just wants to snuff old folks at this point.

Both Pence and Trump s cabinet have stated numerous times that they won t invoke the 25th. The only way for Trump to be removed from office is through impeachment and then removal by congress...which takes far too long to actually happen.  Dude has 8 legitimate days left... Not a conspiracy guy  but this just screams there  39 s more going on than we  39 re aware of  i just think it s theatre. they want to discredit him and ensure he can t run in 2024.

But  let  39 s be real  at this point I  39 m really not sure he  39 s got a snowballs chance in hell is he tried... Regardless of another impeachment.  You  39 re only stoking the flames at this point.  they just want to absolutely destroy everything associated with Trump. Impeaching him isn  39 t about removing him now  but making sure he can  39 t even begin to think about running for office again in 2024. ITs a waste of time and effort  but thats what the dems do best.  laptop  DNI report  Durham report  Assange  Thus the need for diapers these days  right   I think that they actually fear Trump for what he stands for  the conservatives bully pulpit. Why would they be trying to such great lengths to discredit him if he was a failed president.  Thats how history will be written whether they impeach again or not

t3_kutgac,Congressman If the Capitol Officer Hadnt Fired His Shot Rioters Wouldve Hanged Black People,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kutgac/congressman_if_the_capitol_officer_hadnt_fired/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  rel  nofollow  https   discord.gg conservative  a   Where the fuck did they even come up with that   Its easy when you just outright ban anyone with a different thought or who critically thinks.  The royalty  congress  will just say shit and it s the job of the courtiers  judges  police  bureaucrats  big tech  to propagate that shit to the peasants. We are back in medieval times. It s 1021 AD with information technology.  You can literally make up anything you want in an alternate timeline.  Liberals do that. So many of them have mental illnesses so its not that hard to see why they come up with crazy scenarios in their heads.  He has mental health issues  that  39 s where it came from.  Democrats are all about proving the negative.  Wut   From what I ve seen the last 48 hours  the Democrats are reframing this as a neonazi coup.  Lmfao... what  Everytime you think it can  39 t get any more asinine  they prove you wrong.  We live in an absolute clown world  Democrats... Always having to make everything about race.  So leftists are cool with cops shooting unarmed civilians now   As long as its us...  That s quite the extrapolation  It  39 s in keeping with Biden  39 s  quot uniting quot  message  75 million black  white  Hispanic and Asian Americans are all white supremacists  Nazis and closet Klan members. Turn your back for an instant and they  39 ll lynch someone.  My wife  happens to be black  she  39 s a well known white supremacist.  If nobody wants to bother reading the article  this statement is from the Congressman who feared that Guam would capsize and worries over a world without balloons.  We are being governed by all sorts that you would expect to see in a cartoon insane asylum.    Guam capsizing. Thats awsome. Keep electing that guy for sure.  Jesus Christ  I know leftists are idiots but how can they believe this retarded nonsense   Republicans bad....Democrats good  JFC just when I thought they couldn  39 t say any dumber shit and of course it is the Guam guy.   if an innocent woman hadn t been slaughtered in cold blood with a bullet through the heart  then there would be more imaginary lynchings like jussie smollett and bubba wallace   BTW that Root Insurance commercial with Bubba Wallace is obscene. An FBI investigation of a garage door pull  smearing NASCAR fans everywhere as racists but Trump is an ogre. Screw Root Insurance and Bubba Wallace.  Not sure how you get to this from looking at pictures of some dude sitting at a desk or another guy stealing a podium.  It was the look in their eye.. You could just tell he was like  quot id sure like to lynch a minority  but i guess this podium will do for now... FOR NOW quot   Oh for fucks sake  someone find a picture of a black protestor in the capital already.  There were many. Including that BLM guy. He walked in a huge crowd of trump supporters and was never accosted in anyway. But we  39 re all savage Nazis just salivating at the thought of harming minorities.  The thought of harming minorities really hit home.  Makes me think of politicians salivating at the thought of oppressing the masses.  No fucking way. Wouldn t have happened  A congressman actually said this ... Jesus fuck  The shit that is just being made up and reported as news in the last week would make Goebbels pop like a water balloon.   Of course it  39 s Hank Johnson  who has repeatedly proven himself to be one of the dumbest people in America  look up the videos of his gaffes  this is the same man who worried Guam would tip over and sink   who makes this claim.  So I had someone do this on my Facebook.  They had a picture of a lynched black guy   then the noose someone made  which I  39 m not sure about   was that symbolically for pence   And then the dreaded confederate flag.   This is not about race. Why do the propaganda channels demand race becomes the issue  It  39 s almost like they want people divided by race so we are easier to conquer.   Democrats lack imagination. They are still trying to blame everything on racism.  Wow this has got to be the ugliest propaganda seen so far. And these evil bastards are running our country  Bee article  WTF.  Get ready... we are stuck with this till the Democrat voter is tired of the bullshit.  No I saw the noose hanging from bubba  39 s garage door. It  39 s true they were there to hang  quot B quot  lack people   Lmao. It s driving them crazy that Trump supporters didn t completely destroy the capitol  like they probably wanted us to. They wanted us to burn the fucking building down.   This is the mouth breather who thought Guam would tip over.  This is the most ridiculous  unfounded claim I ve seen to date.  What in the hell    They will lie any lie....knowing that so many of their base will believe it.  One of the key points of fascism. Put race above the individual  just more of the same from the left that are so quick to project what they are onto others  That s quite a leap   when you watch too many movies and MSM  I was looking for the satire flair  These nazis have no shame in their lies and propaganda.  If officers didnt fight them  BLM ists would have hanged white people  This makes Alex Jones look sane.  ...wut   That  39 s as melodramatic as Gersh Kuntzman  39 s AR 15 PTSD  Lmao what  Wouldn  39 t it be  quot hung black people quot

t3_kuq3hk,Capitol cop led DC rioters away from open Senate chambers door before it was locked likely saving lives,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuq3hk/capitol_cop_led_dc_rioters_away_from_open_senate/,Are they saying they saved the lives of Trump supporters that would have been shot by the police  or are they saying the Trump supporters were going to kill people     gt  including one with a semiautomatic weapon   Lol no I don  39 t think they do  I know  and its truly hysterical that these people can be so against something that they do not even have a fundamental understanding about.  The way liberal subreddits are spinning this is  quot the black man used himself as red meat in a crowd of a bunch of white supremacist klansmen. what a hero  quot   Liberals only see people by their race sadly  Yeah that headline is all sorts of wacky. The cop led them away  and they followed  So maybe they weren  39 t rioting  And if that  39 s the case who was threatening whose life   Also  the capitol police LET THEM IN. How could they not have been prepared by having the doors locked ahead of time   The title is very one sided. The only bit of truth is the cop kept them away from the chamber.  Lives might have been in danger if everyone involved in the incident had been carrying a rifle along with a willingness to use it. Not coincidentally  that  39 s also what would have made it count as a  quot coup. quot   Just doing their part not to get cancelled. Might as well squash news outlets too since we are canceling everything.  Why were lives not at risk when Democrats stormed the Senate in 2018   Fuck these piece of shit rioters. I couldn t be more disappointed with this sub defending the same atrocities they condemned this summer  It s not about the rioters  it s about the double standards. One building is stormed  they re domestic terrorists. Antifa BLM torch thousands of buildings  cars  murder cops  and they re labeled mostly peaceful protestors. Personally I don t support what they did  but I m not going to condemn it either if that makes sense  Probably doesn t  and I know it s bad for the right with the media going into a frenzy over this. I ve even seen local newspapers with giant headlines    strong CAPITOL INVADED  strong  . But the election was stolen  people nationwide are upset. Some people have had enough with the bs in our  leaders . I don t have time to riot  or even protest  like most of us we work too much so the best we can do is talk about it on Reddit  until we re censored   Your morality is weak if it  39 s based on how the media frames things. It  39 s okay to condemn both the riots this summer and what happened in the Capitol. Anybody that decries one but not the other is frankly a hypocrite.  That s not what was said and you know it  No  my morality exactly as it was during the last dozen riots. Still strong and on point. I m tired of the double standards  If you don t like my opinion take your complaints to somewhere else. At least these people went after the ones they re angry at  tell me what the thousand plus businesses  amp  home owners did to deserve their property being destroyed. Or how looting clothing  electronics  and appliances helped their cause. If you re going to submit to the media BLM Antifa  that s on you. They at times were literally chanting about killing cops... You forget hardly any politician on the left condemned the violence and murders by the left  and continued to incite violence and uprising for years. Once right protests start destroying public property  I ll condemn it.   It is still important to note the differences between this  and the riots we have seen in the past year. One thing to note  is the scope  with the riots of the past year  we saw them burn loot destroy everything around them  here  we saw a focused outlet of frustration.  Nobody in this sub is defending violence   deleted   Look at the other comments on this comment thread and all of the excuses for why this riot isn t a disgrace   deleted   OP literally replied to my original comment saying BLM the media is why they wouldn t condemn the riot.   That in no way is defending the riots  there is virtually no one here that doesn  39 t think rioting in all instances are bad  pointing out the double standards doesn  39 t mean that one is suddenly good.  Not condemning the riot is defending it.  Probably the dumbest fucking thing I  39 ve read today  I  39 ve only looked at a few supporters of this   they  39 re generally not people that have been here for a while. A number have deleted their comment history. Honestly  it  39 s time to take the sub private I think....take the time to clean house.  So start condeming your own Republican leaders  too. They want blood NOW but during the riots this summer...they did nothing to help stop it.  So...there would have been some fisticuffs leading to deaths    quot Saving Lives quot ....maybe the lives of the rioters I suppose.  I didn  39 t know selfies are lethal.  Has anyone explained the guy with zipcuffs yet  Cause you know....you don  39 t need zipcuffs for selfies...not the NORMAL selfies anyway...  A couple larpers. Not a threat.  Fire extinguishers are  So why are they prosecuting the people taking selfies  and not the ones swinging fire extinguishers.  Because they dont know who hit him in the face with the fire extinguisher and ultimately killed him. They  39 re still looking for him you donut.   Ok redditor  I  39 m sure the crowd was armed with fire extinguishers and ready to attack some senators. You can  39 t be delusional enough to think anything would  39 ve happened.  Im delusional  YOURE delusional. The cop DID get hit over the head with a fire extinguisher. And any time a mob breaks into a building and is kicking down doors i wont be surprised when someone defends their life. Its not hard to be beat to death by a mob swinging fists and kicking people to death  Looking at the streams any violence seems to have been isolated incidents  except when they initially pushed through the cops.  I didnt say it wasnt. I said they smashed a cops face in with a fire extinguisher which you implied was some conspiracy  But I didn  39 t.  Most of the ones reported in the news died from heart attack  stroke  or cop bullet  so not sure how they assume anything about lives.  The stroke one was in the hospital because a rioter smashed his head with a fire extinguisher. Be honest with your framing. We all hate when the left does it  no reason to lie about what happened  Someone had messaged me calling me out about me questioning how a stroke was related to the riots. My comment of course  from the day after  and there was lots of conflicting information. Sorry to say  but they aren  39 t framing it incorrectly  the media did report that an officer died from a stroke  and left out the context of being on life support after being beaten with a fire extinguisher.  That is the cop who had a stroke  I believe. I am talking about an article that said one of the protesters died of a stroke and the way it was worded sounded to me like he never even GOT to the protest  yet they were counting him as a death from the protest. i am not 100  sure if he made it to it or not  though.

This of course will benefit the mega corporations that bankrolled Biden s campaign and can afford to comply with any regulations  while crushing smaller businesses that provide competition  Recession here we come. As a business owner  I have been dreading the Left getting control again.  Maybe Joe won  39 t get inaugurated  Hard to hope for it now. It seems all the avenues to combat the fraud have failed and people are no longer fighting.  Now in retribution phase  so it  39 s time for blood on the lintel hoping the hate passes over their household.  Businesses have waited 8 years for Obama to leave office. Why do you think the stock market exploded during the trump years    And now we will be heading into a recession  I  39 m at the point where since my job won  39 t be effected by biden at all  idgaf. These liberals who voted for biden to ship out their jobs oversea deserve it.   Right as I m graduating from law school. Woohoo   We could end up with hyperinflation. We  39 ve already been promised so many of the lead up actions  mandated prices  confiscation  in keeping with SJW and Green goals  domestic companies regulated and taxed  out of existence   forced reduction in energy production  government created shortages. Biden Harris will have to print more money and government spending is going to continue going through the roof.  So basically  Biden promised the American people that they  39 ll soon get to live in Argentina.  Zero doubt here

No  those are Agents.  You can say whatever you want if it s against the right.  Twitter s response to the complaint was   We conducted an investigation and have determined Ms. Banks is a liberal so no violation occurred.   Oh  she  39 s no liberal. She just went on a rant on Parlor about liberals. But then again  she is bat shit crazy  so who really knows.  She  39 s part of the victim class that liberals have given permission to to do or say anything.  Maybe she was being nice.  Maybe she wants a train and was just wishing Palin luck with this.   s  It s less because she s liberal than because her target is Republican  that makes it okay  s  This is the real reason.  no bad tactics  only wrong targets  Isn t this something the police should be investigating   Nope. Police exist only for coffee and recycling violations.  Palin is hoping that Banks herself shows up. She d tear her ass a new one.  Clearly AWS should cancel Twitter  39 s contract  Hey Banks  children playing with matches often get burned  Wow. Dats fucked up.  In a way you know she knows what she is talking about. She didn t get a record deal w o a bunch of old  ashey dicks stuffed in her face.  As I ve already said 3 times today  F Twitter  So this person has legal ties to Elon.

Where was this when BLM and antifa riots killed and injured officers  How about those two officers who were ambushed a few weeks back  What about David Dorn   The flag was at half mast for almost the entire year.  I guess the media was too busy denying the violence to report on that then.  No amount of downvoting will make your post untrue.  Is this going to last all the way till inauguration  That would be some classic trump shade  100  make the dems raise it to full mast and show they don  39 t care  Like usual.

Having millions of people who sincerely worship a higher power ABOVE the government  is a damned good thing in my book.  Seems like you see the role religion plays in society. You should do some thinking about doing some Bible learning.  My beliefs are sincerely held  but thank you   Do you think it s bad that society and it s people are becoming more disconnected from religion  That s a complicated question. I think a big percentage of humans are hard wired to seek religion. And when they eschew theology  they often end up worshipping some scary things. Like government. My most strongly held beliefs about religion is that Americans deserve almost unfettered access to it because of its profound importance to people s lives and identities. I m very upset about churches closing for covid  I don t think that s constitutional in any way.   Thanks for explaining. I also agree that government worship or attachment to ideas like inclusion and progressivism is very religious in nature. Filling a god shaped hole in people s hearts as Shapiro says.  Highly recommend the Dwell app  They ll ban it  This world needs Jesus more than ever     To find him or his return   Both  Yes.  Thank you for the love  everyone. Cowards are giving me hate in my DMs. I just keep reminding them that God loves them. Bless you all     Until religion becomes illegal  then that will be banned too  This is amazing.  We need it.  Big Tech is probably about to cancel Jesus for not being trans.  s  Great  but there are multiple  opposing  interpretations of said passages that most listeners have to rifle through     It s so hard to explain to people that they actually need to study the Bible  not just take a preacher s or a 5 minute devotional s word for it.  so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth  it shall not return to me empty  but it shall accomplish that which I purpose  and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it   so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth  it shall not return to me empty  but it shall accomplish that which I purpose  and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it

THIS IS SURELY THE END FOR DRUMPF   1   The walls are closing in   How long have you been screaming that. Lol  They are making Trump the enemy  1. This is ridiculous.  He has been since he announced that he was running for President. Then they went at him harder when he beat HRC. Then they went at him even harder when he didn  39 t start WW3  made peace in NK and Russia. They actually wanted the opposite to happen  just so they could say  quot we told ya so  quot . Now they feel stupid. Which is weird  because a guy with green hair and a shitty beard saying that he  39 s a female is pretty stupid.  Very true. And it s nice to see a fellow Bostonian here as well  Hope all is well  We  39 re in the belly of the beast here. Head on a swivel  bud.

The GOP was never on Trumps side  and I think that is very evident right now.  You are giving GOP congresscritters far too much credit. When they had the trifecta  they had to put up or shut up  so we got all sorts of  quot uhhh  when we said we should repeal Obamacare what we really meant was .... quot .   Yeah  people claim he had 2 years to do things  but not really. The person who actually had 2 years was Obama during his first 2 years. They could have combated  quot systemic racism quot  then and there.  Gotta love the ACLU both shitting on Trump but using his situation to push their own agenda simultaneously.  since the government is on the same team as these corporations  what exactly is there to do to bring down big tech   it is scary how 5  6 companies can control so much  Good. Someone has too. Biden sure as shit wont. They just got him elected  Trump  39 s gonna milk his last days in office so badass lmao  4 more years  baby  Correct me if I  39 m wrong but hasn  39 t Trump already conceded    quot conceded quot   He also said hes planning for a peaceful transition of power  hes already in power  transition means change.  if we  39 re in open insurrection the 20th is null and void  I thought some bill  cant remember the name  meant the insurrection act could only be used with Congress  39  approval   the courts can figure that out.  Considering the court  39 s actions recently  I have big doubts they  39 d back Trump  stop him  Well  a bit too late  but I  39 m glad he  39 s at least gonna go for it in the last few days I guess  Good but you knew this was coming since alex jones and the donald was banned. Would been a good time when you guys controlled congress.  This maybe his most important work as President of the US.  Lindsey Graham made a comment about this and Trump but shows he  39 s just a coward and turncoat. He was nowhere to be seen when they had the Senate...  Thank God   Far too late.  No one cares what he has to say now and anything he does will be seen as revenge and overturned by Biden.  Dealing with tech companies  especially in regards to free speech needed to be done a few years ago  not when he  39 s on the way out the door with zero power or legislative support.  Too little too late.  There is a word for Big Tech s pursuit of political power

Everyone agrees what happened at the capital is awful  and those responsible should be prosecuted.  But get the fuck out of here with this unprecedented bullshit when this kind of disruption and violence has been a Leftist go to tactic for decades.  Get the fuck out of here with your claims of Trumps incitement  when you cant even point to a quote that was inciting  while all the while ignoring actual incitements from Pelosi  Waters  Sanders  and Omar.  And get the fuck out of here with your claims of sacred territory  when you were hapoy to celebrate the disruptions during the Kavanaugh hearings.   removed   Dont downplay it.  People still died and it was something that NEVER should have happened.  But the hypocrisy is sickening.   removed    removed    removed   This exactly. People are quick to condemn anyone not agreeing with the narrative but let s keep what happened in perspective. Riots this last summer were far worse and I m pretty sure politicians are just mad because someone trashed their office. It s a little different having it happen to you rather than watching it on tv.  LMFAO.  All the unflaired replies Im getting are  quot but... but... Trump told people to fight quot   as if no politician in history has used that phrase before and only Trump completely meant it literally.   removed   They are hoping that there is another incident at inauguration so they can use it to turn the facisim dials to 11.  If they go through with this  it has nothing to do with Trump and everything to do with weeding out Republican loyalists. It is a test and intended to divide Republicans even more.  And they  39 re going to get nowhere just like the Mueller investigation...  Have they crawled out from under their desks yet   On what grounds   What crime did Trump commit

Yeah but shut up you alt right nazi sexist.  I don  39 t agree with what AWS did  but it  39 s foolish to play the free market argument here. These companies acted freely.  Hopefully  people begin seeing the danger Big Tech represents.  So far  the people seem to be celebrating this as a good thing... insane   The left is so stupid it  39 s insane. Like they all seem to agree these mega corporate are the bad guys for countless  countless reasons. So hey brain dead idiots  if all the biggest most evil things in the world are so far on your side and trying to silence the other  did you ever stop to think even for a sec  maybe just maybe you are the bad guys     Can we pool enough money for parler to start from scratch  Is it technically possible   The infrastructure required would be in the millions.  And it would require a massive increase of employment at Parler just to manage that infrastructure.  And that would also require talented experienced professionals who probably already work at Twitter Google just to know the basics.  Sometimes even money won t solve problems.  Money is necessary but not enough. Oh shush  I forgot Parler might have no means to receive any donations soon.  Why are you being downvoted  Are my questions not legit  I saw Gab asking for donations.  Its probably brigaders and trolls  This is censorship at this point  Amazon already pulled the plug...  Why gab.com comments are downvoted   This subreddit is constantly being swarmed by leftist clowns.  I  39 m guessing few if any Conservatives go into left wing reddits to cause trouble  but leftist are like a bad rash.  its time to drop that amazon prime subscription  If you go someplace else on the Internet to purchase  you are probably doing your buy over an Amazon server.  The size and reach of Amazon is scary massive.  Canceled mine yesterday  was due for renewal later this month.  Same here  i hope they go out of biz or at least hurt a little  Time to goto gab  Gab.com  Is chance it could be saved  I wouldn t have a problem with Big Tech banning anyone IF there was actually a free market.   They need to start a Gofundme to get their own servers.  Yeah  but go fund me would shut them down instantly

Probably doesn t impact Trump too much aside from his ego.  I don  39 t watch golf anyway

Oh no what will we do without the PGA going there     the goal is to hurt Trump. If he wasn t a billionaire with hundreds of millions in assets he would be royally fucked.  Peak TDS.  It  39 s laughable at this point  I think TDS ended.  Oh no
t3_kuo0ec,Email Service Suspends Trumps Account Cutting a Vital Link to His Supporters,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuo0ec/email_service_suspends_trumps_account_cutting_a/,Just think about this for one moment  President Trump is still President and he has been basically cut off from communicating with the country. Yeah he can go on the news  but that  39 s about it  and I would be interested if they would even carry him on the news now.  MSNBC and CNN cut away from Trumps covid briefings several times. I have no doubt they d scoff at airing a live statement from him  MANY naive conservative on this sub say that he isn t cut off. He can go on tv at anytime  Right  If they can do that to a sitting President imagine what they could do to us peasants.  The news were the first to block him  which was the entire reason he was forced to use alternative ways of getting his message out. Since even before he won the primary  he was being censored and shut down.  this is what communists do. they disappear their political opposition.  Got a screenshot or something of that   it was a video statement I believe. I  39 m sure it was mirrored on his telegram account  Seeing on youtube that he signed the insurrection act  but no source for that. If it  39 s true shits gonna get weird.   a href  https   i.imgur.com 97jgAwN.jpg  this guy is saying it. among others.  a     a href  https   tenor.com tJ0e.gif  rel  nofollow  Oh damn.  a   Damn. Even email  If tech may think they are doing Democrat bidding  but all this is making all Americans uncomfortable. It s unconstitutional  What are Americans going to do about it  Nothing.  USA has become insanely brainwashed  from the racial genders theories taught in schools  in corporations  identity politics everywhere in entertainment  cities being heavily dominated by democrats supporters... it s like a cancer spreading. You see clear censorship  propaganda and these guys are just praising it  even the deaths of the people at the Capitol.  People have become too comfortable. If it s convenient for them  then the system is fine. They don t care about anyone else but themselves essentially. That whole  first it happened to them  thing fits this situation perfectly.  Well  I would have some sort of hope if we didn t already see these companies cross the line before Trumps first term. There were two years for the GOP to do something about it. They did NOTHING. And now they will not get another chance. This is a blitz to make conservative values disappear forever. And they already won.  In the us and in the academic system and can confirm. Some things bypass even me  which is scary.  Also it  39 s idiotic in that they will just make people more mad  not less so. lol.  RIP 1A  thanks to the radical left and their fascist movement freedom of speech is going out the door. Meanwhile the politicians can call for sedition for 4 years  social media allowed for calling to violence against any trump supporter  Cathy griffin had the presidents decapitated head in a photoshoot  and it s all acceptable.  RIP the constitution  search  quot abolish the constitution quot  and you  39 ll be surprised.  Well then. There  39 s really only one alternative if you  39 re still on the Trump Train  pen  paper  and stamps.  If lib voters were sane  they  39 d se the true colors of the liberal movement now and switch over to the republican party. What a bunch of babies the people owning these companies and the media are. lol.  By censoring Trump  I can  39 t help but feel that they  39 ve given him the opportunity to toil in silence and to meticulously plan his next moves. I really wonder what he  39 s doing now that  he  39 s been removed from major platforms  Liberals are going to turn on each other now that they don  39 t have anything new from Trump. It  39 s going to be glorious.  That  39 s the thing about all of this...  Good point. And that s their miscalculation. They all think they re together and advocating these tactics to destroy their current enemy. After all  the end justifies the means. They re completely ignorant of the fact that at some point they ll be on the wrong side of it all and these tactics will be used against them.  he  39 s on telegram at least for now. good app. secure and encrypted.
t3_kusu3n,Rep. Cori Bush looks to expel GOP members of Congress using the 14th Amendment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kusu3n/rep_cori_bush_looks_to_expel_gop_members_of/,What happened to  unity    Empty propaganda. Resembles China s   Two Systems One Country  when they took over Hong Kong.  I don  39 t know  man  but this smells like what commies did in NK  USSR  China  etc when they wanted to consolidate party rule...  Is there any way forward. The democrats clearly are bloodthirsty and conservatives have no way to communicate with dems.   This absolutely sounds more like an actual coup   I believe we are already in America s second Civil War. It s just a Cold Civil War at the moment though. The divide among Americans is so deep. Neither side trusts the other. Something like George Floyd s killing could have been a time for Americans to come together and say  Wow  we need to do more to ensure this doesn t happen again   I don t think I ever talked with anyone that thought it was ok. At least until the full body cam footage was released and after watching that. I can better understand the officers but still think they did the wrong things. Most Americans  regardless of political leanings  agreed that it was a terrible thing to happen. Instead  the left turned it into a race thing  as they usually do  and used it to label all cops as racist.  I completely agree with your George Floyd point. 300 million  people watched that video with hearts breaking. We could have had a real chance at a movement to address police brutality and aggression but that wasn  39 t good enough for the left. They burned our cities under the false flag of racism when we could have had real change in how we train and insure the safety of both the people and police.  Exactly  a time that could have been used to heal the deep and growing divide between Americans was instead used as a club with which the left again accused anyone who disagreed with them a racist. They don t want unity and never have wanted it.  Wait what  Who did George Floyd kill   No one  he was killed.  Oh  I see. You have only seen a small part of that video of him being arrested. Gotcha.    No  I ve watched the whole video. I say he was killed because that s what happened. Would he have died that day had he not interacted with the police  Whether or not he died due to a combination of being high and the stress of interacting with the police or the officer s knee on his neck is still up for debate. I think both parties  the officers and George Floyd  did things wrong.  Yes he had three times the lethal amount of fentanyl in his system  that s why he couldn t breathe.  I m sure the large amounts of meth and fentanyl had nothing to do with it.  Came here to say it seems like battle lines are being drawn.  I REALLY don t think they ll go through with this.  So much for reconciliation.  They only want reconciliation of there is part of  quot truth and reconciliation. quot   So is secession finally on the table   Please  I wish more people would honestly push for this.  Honest question  how would a secession work best for both parties  States vote  So red states would be their own countries or together  Just thinking about it my state  Florida is red  but Georgia is blue and all the states surrounding Georgia are red.  I would think states would have to vote. Depending on the results there may have to be some tweaks to the lines. This is stuff way above my paygrade. It is the only bloodless idea I can come up with  all other roads are going down a dark path.  Wondering the same thing. I live closer to west coast  so would those states be cut off from the other blue states   Seriously. The left can have their communist dictatorship.  Just know that half the country want no part of that insanity.  This needs to happen. What ever state does this will have an immediate influx of money and conservatives. Let the left go left  the right go right and see who wins the battle of economy.  I  39 ve already started discussing with my wife moving from Colorado to Texas.  I love it here in Colorado  grew up here.  The last few years I was in the navy I just wanted to get the fuck out of San Diego and get back.  The main problem is my job is tied to the state now.  So I  39 m getting set to start researching engineering firms in Texas.  I would prefer to stay here and try to bring conservatism back here but I  39 m not sure if that  39 s likely.  We are doing the same. It is getting to the point where I don  39 t feel safe for my family. If there is a state to kick off the movement it is tx.  Or SC  those crazy bastards  Avoid the crazy rush  Idaho is the place to be.  I ve always wanted to move to Montana. All that open land and great American views. So many beautiful places in the states  Nope. We would sit here enjoying our freedom and our own business  lol. If you want in the action  Texas or Montana.  Any crazy weather like tornadoes or such in Idaho  Sounds like a pleasant place.  Lots of snow  nothing extreme though.  Idaho is pretty up there for me.  I  39 m a Civil Engineer and my wife is a teacher.  So we can move just about anywhere.  I just want to be able to keep mountain biking as much as possible and get into hunting.  There is more engineering jobs in Texas so that and the rise in private mountain biking trails really makes me lean that way.  There is some great biking and outstanding outdoors up here in the northern area. Not a lot of engineering  but our hunting stayed open all covid long  lol.  Ya  I hear the biking is great.  But you can  39 t do it year round like you mostly can here in Colorado and can in Texas.  But at the end of the day its really about finding a good job  though.  I just graduated with my degree in May and my current employer gave me a great salary it was very obvious they believe in my potential.  Combination of my military service  academic record  and my motivation must have really impressed them.  I thank God everyday it worked out and I  39 m already making more money than I did in the navy as an E6.  So  really  if I can find another similar situation in Texas  Idaho  Montana  etc I  39 ll make the jump.  One bummer to all the work from home is Idaho became a possibility to lot more people  lol. Best of luck in all   I actually think this is all going to push the bill that s already filed in Texas to get serious consideration. It would call for a referendum in Texas on whether to leave the US.  We should really be talking reverse secession.  Need to kick out NY  Chicago  Philly  San Fran etc and make them independent city states like renaissance italy.  Then they can have whatever laws they want without bothering the rest of us.  I actually think this needs to happened. How would the country divide up though  Cali  Nevada  Colorado  Washington and Oregon would be cut off from the northeast coastal blue states. Although Nevada could go red.  We could start with a trial separation and see how it goes.  Texas is ready   let s leave this shit hole.  Protesting the results of an election isn t the same as attempting an insurrection   But they do have the majority needed to most of the things they want  if they can only enforce the division on party lines  no   As it stands  I think only some things.  Different kinds of policies need different degrees of majority  like passing a budget is different than impeachment  for example.  Indeed.  I think the progressive agenda is effectively on hold   can t see Joe Manchin or Diane Feinstein voting for open borders or free everything.  I don t know why anyone in WV votes for joe anymore. I can t stand the man.  Maybe  if they can create laws that appeal to their very broad membership.  I don t Joe Manchin signing off on open borders or universal healthcare  do you     How to start a civil war 101.  These people are going out of their way to make it impossible for each side to communicate. It s like they re intentionally trying to make the country come flying apart at the seams.  Fine by me  as long as we can kick out Schumer  Pelosi  AOC  Cuomo  and every other fuckking dem who is on camera inciting   39 rebellion  39  as is so well laid out.  Pelosi  by demanding his nuclear codes and attempting to take his military power and authority  is literally on paper as  quot attempted military coup quot   What should bother us is that the coverage on MSM is telling people she is both entitled to make the request and justified. Lots of stupid sheep out there.   removed    removed    removed    removed    removed    removed    removed    removed    removed    removed   So every democratic congressman that called for the abolition of the constitution will be thrown out correct. Because I  dont believe that invoking a constitutionally outlined process is in anyway act8ng against the constitution.  They had better be careful what they say and do  people are still genuinely pissed off and something like this can function as the catalyst.   Republicans will run and hide. That  39 s what they do best.  They  39 d have a decent case  unfortunately. Articles II and III of the 14th Amendment provide for the removal of elected officials who engaged in  quot insurrection and rebellion quot . It wouldn  39 t be so hard top stick it on the GOP.  I remember a group that kept telling me not to tolerate such intolerance... Seems like they were the ones behind it all along.  Exactly what the nazis did to their opposition in 1933... but who are the nazis again   What kind of democracy doesn t allow groups of violent protestors the ability to overturn legitimate elections results  Justice is gone   Overturning elections  RRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

She tried to use the armed forces against a sitting President. That came from the pentagon.  And yet she appears to be Speaker for life.

Outright treason and sedition  but reddit and the tech industry doesn  39 t seem to mind.  The tech companies and the MSM helped them do it.  Crazy times...  Can you imagine how desperate people will be for a MAGA redo after 4 years of Dems degrading of individual freedoms and quality of life  The only question is will there be any chance at all of a free and fair election in 2024.  Even if it s not a TRUMP 2024 ticket  at least we now know what we re looking for in a President  now.  Trump will be a far bigger threat to them after the presidency.  That is why they want to deprive him of all means of communication with his base.  The funniest thing about this is that she obviously fears he would win.  she isn  39 t the only one in congress. That  39 s why they are wanting it to move forward  She knows a second term of trump is opening the flood gates of investigations into the corruption in washington.  Unpopular opinion.   It looks like she d want to spend time with family  traveling and enjoying life. But I guess power is a helluva drug.  Rick James is that you    What if I want to vote for him again  Isnt that my right   I ll still vote for him.  Let s face it I would vote for a syphilitic  radioactive  mole rat before I vote democrat again.  What  39 s the difference   If it  39 s the right kind of radioactive mole rat it can aid in chemo   Well  she is very concerned about the will of the American people  judging by her recent rhetoric. If it is the will of the American people to elect Trump if he runs again  who is she to overturn our will   Pelosi isn  39 t concerned about the will of the American people  she  39 s concerned with power and nothing else.  LMAO    Pelosi is a deranged moron and obviously unfit for office.  Of course she does. Her laptop was stolen and most likely Trump has it lol  I certainly hope so.  I will celebrate that day Pelosi finally dies of her old age.  Or you know you could let the American people decide.  We  39 re not even allowed to decide who gets elected why let us decide who gets impeached.  By all means let  39 s waste a bunch of money on another failed removal attempt lol country  39 s doomed anyway. Welcome to The Great Reset  How do you erode a  US  government with communist and totalitarian tendencies  Start infiltrating it little by little and destroy it from within.  Sop she must be admitting he could win again  which means she doesn  39 t believe in her blue wave or that Biden can do good enough to even beat the same guy he supposedly beat this time.  She  39 s got less than two weeks and the impeachment process here takes at least a month based on our history  That assumes hearings and testimony. She can go straight for a vote in the House. The Senate will not take it up to remove him but given the makeup of the House  Trump will be impeached.  Who decides whether senate will take it up  McConnell   He can be impeached even after leaving office  strictly to prevent him from holding any office again.  But he has already been impeached. What would make this any different   No shit.  This is what it is about  and the gop 2024 hopefuls will be voting to impeach too  bit they fail to see that will make them ineligible to the conservative voters  I would like to put my foot in her mouth to keep her from speaking again but I realize that that would be a bad thing for America and American ideals. I love my country enough that even if I had the opportunity  I would not do it. Too bad she either lacks the love of country or lacks the sense to know that her statements and actions are hurting our country.  The 25th amendment talk is stupid  but either way Trump shouldn t run in the future.  But that won  39 t stop him from running again. A conviction in the senate would be necessary  and let  39 s face it  if they get 2 3s to convict him a week before he leaves office  there will be a civil war.  MAGA 2024. Its clear they are scared of Trump running again  since they won  39 t be able to cheat as easily with mail ins. Unless their chinease friends create another pandemic...  She s just terrified because of what CIA operatives have found on her laptop. Her days are numbered.  Wasn  39 t it just a random aide  39 s laptop  What evidence is there that the CIA has it  as opposed to some rando that rioted at the Capitol   If in fact it was just some aids laptop she wouldn t be going around so frantically demanding that Pence enact the 25th amendment upon trump also trying to get a top general to nullify trumps authority upon the military and the Pentagon. Otherwise she would just be waiting out the time knowing that he s out of office in a matter of days. There s a lot going on in the world and if you stay adamant about research and connect the dots. One can see there s a hell of a lot going on that most Americans are completely oblivious to.  Trump 2024  Trump needs to be mayor. He  39 d actually have more fun telling Liberals to fuckoff.  Trump is going to mop the floor with her this week.  How so   Biden won the presidency and Trump will still be everything the dems talk about and shape policy around.

t3_kuqqgs,Conservative WalkAway group kicked off Facebook amid purge moves to CloutHub,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuqqgs/conservative_walkaway_group_kicked_off_facebook/,I think all this purging is gonna bite the leftists in the ass eventually.  I think a lot of people who voted for Biden simply because they didn t like Trump are in for a huge wake up call. The left is once again collectively losing their minds even when they won. Lots of people didn t vote foe this shit and they won t vote for it again. The left need to get their act together and govern  not spend the next 2 years seeking revenge. If they don t  they re gonna be back out on their asses.  Most people didn t vote for Biden. Rather they voted against Trump. The Biden presidency is going to be a rude wake up call to people  more rude than they perceived Trump to be. Will people then see the wisdom of Trump or will they still be in denial  eg.   there is a better way than Biden or Trump    Biden has to do this protect us from fascists    My bet is on the latter. The amount of simping in America is unbelievable.  The  protecting us from fascists  thing is already being questioned by many that didn t like Trump. This is why the left has to keep the outraged shitstorm going. The funny thing is  they re still giving Trump the attention he wants AND making themselves look even more unhinged. The next 2 years are going to be interesting but if they can t get past Trump  the midterms are going to be a shit storm for the left.  I hope that you are correct. I have lost faith in the American electorate. And even if the American electorate wants change in 2022  the establishment may rig the elections forever. All of America could be a one party state like California is today.  One of the things I saw in this cycle that gives me hope was specific to Ca. The Republican Party decided to use the new rules the Dems enacted that lost them Congressional seats in 2018. By playing like the Dems  they took back several seats with the likelihood of taking back more. These are all seats in very right leaning districts. We just need to play as dirty as they do and use the same tactics.  That is what I am hoping for.  All of this shit will.  But what exactly did Walkaway do worthy of being kicked off  I m sure the reason is BS  but what was their BS reason   This is the most concerning ban I  39 ve seen this week. They didn  39 t even give a reason based on what the leaders like Karlyn and Brandon said. They just straight up banned them  AND all the administrators personal accounts too. This is the most blatant political bans I  39 ve seen. There  39 s absolutely no justification for it other than the fact that they were running a page which directly countered the Democrat party  My goodness. This is outright facism. I wonder how they will react. Will they organize and protest  Will that be acceptable to the establishment like BLM 
t3_kus3uy,Pelosi says lawmakers moving forward with impeachment calls Trump imminent threat to our Democracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kus3uy/pelosi_says_lawmakers_moving_forward_with/,I feel like we live in parallel universe right now.  He was such a threat  they took the weekend off .  What the hell is wrong with this lady  Seriously   Fear. Serious fear. Of what  I don  39 t know  but these are the actions of someone who is afraid.  I don  39 t think it is fear  I think it is power. They believe they are untouchable and that the will of the American people are on their side. So they will silence any opposition and do whatever they want. I think reality will hit them hard  but I am scared as to what that reality will look like.  you don  39 t know   Doubt it  if he did he would have used it.  Durham report. DNI report. Assange is now on the board.  Grew up in a mafia family.  Says the woman who literally tried to stage a fucking coup.  Not tried to. They did.  This is the third time this past week. She went to the military and asked to stage a coup against the president because of  quot nuclear codes quot  and the military refused. Just a few moments ago  she threatened Pence to invoke the 25th amendment and now  she  39 s forcing a vote over the articles of impeachment without even having a hearing or testimony in the house and senate.  I initially thought it was just theatre for the left and msm to slurp  but no. This is a person showing fear.  This is sorta like how Stalin went insane out of fear against Tito  Yugoslavian dictator  when his assassination attempt of Tito failed multiple times. He then was scared to death that Tito would come back at him out of revenge  so Stalin started having people around him killed for  quot conspiring against him quot  until the stress gave himself a brain hemorrhage and killed him.  it  39 s what i keep saying. this is odd behavior for people that supposedly won and only have 10 days left of Trump  39 s presidency. there  39 s no logical reason for them to behave this way.  This assumes she ever was sane to begin with.  Nancy Pelosi has been a partisan clown my entire life.  SEDITIOOOOOOON   Two simple questions everyone should be asking the Democrats   Well  he DID have that picture of KFC with a fork and knife. He was going to attack that chicken  man.  I kind of get it... using a fork and knife to eat KFC is pretty much a crime against humanity.  And theres the video of eating pizza with a fork and knife with Sarah Palin in NYC    quot A threat to our democracy quot .... They say it over and over but I  39 d give a million dollars to any leftist who can actually give 1 reason why.  America is a federal republic built of independent states  We are not a democracy  and our founding fathers rejected democracy because the passions of the mob were too easily manipulated  and the majority could too easily deprive the minority of their rights.  Checks and balances were built in to limit the power of the mob and protect minority rights.  That seems like the one thing guaranteed to start the next civil war.  Pelosi  queen of sedition.  Want to cringe  Watch the 60 minute interview with her and Leslie Stahl. It was comical.  This woman is looney like a toon  They just want to stop Trump from running next time. They re pushing the narrative of sedition in order to sell the attempt to voters.  Yes I agree they are pushing the  sedition  narrative. That way anybody associated with Trump can be branded as a seditionist too  including current legislators. They are already calling for people like Cruz and Hawley to step down.  That can  39 t be right. I think they  39 re scared of him doing something now. Because if they clear him out now there is no 2024 unless revolution  Do what  His term ends in 10 days. Take a step back and first ask why the Democrats want you to believe Trump is the threat they claim he is. Why do they want you to believe that  Why push an impeachment when it would take effect after he leaves office   Maybe to discount any evidence that had been collected on the vote fraud  Just like the Capitol invasion stopped any Congressional probe into the election  this action by Pelosi would forestall any further investigation of voter fraud by anyone unwilling to be painted as a lunatic.  You say that but once he  39 s out of office he  39 s out of power. People that despise him already do. People that don  39 t will not be swayed by further dirt dragging. We  39 ll just have to see. In fact them pushing harder will probably cement his followers further.  it  39 s all just so crazy isn  39 t it.  2 3 majority to remove  but only a simple majority  51  to bar from future office.  Where is that written   Cornell Law. There s precedent from 1907 and 1936. See footnote 856.   It s a high bar and it s not impossible. Romney and Murkowski would vote for it. There are most likely others. Graham isn t a friend of Trumps. I suspect McConnell isn t going to stand for election again so he may.  McConnell apparently said he would never speak to Trump again after the 20th. Whether he cares about his future after this term or not  he should still consider doing the right thing  not for Trump  but for this country  amp  our constitution. Don  39 t get me wrong though I know I  39 m asking a lot here.  McConnell  Graham  Collins  Toomey  Sasse  Murkowski  Rubio and Romney would go for it. There are others as well.   Rubio goes that route  and I  39 d vote for a literal turd over him in the primary.  Rubio shouldn t be trusted   Jed Bush was a mentor to the man and he betrayed him in 2015.  Still need just 34 to say No.  Mcconnell has already said he  39 s not going to even look at it until after Trump is out of office  What does that tell you  The Republican establishment wants Trump out of the picture.  There s a few Republican snakes on the senate  but I m not sure if there are 17 of them. Romney  Collins  Murskowski  Toomey  and Sasse are the ones I can see voting yes. Then they would need 12 more after that. Won t happen.  Unless they divide the Republicans and win a large majority in 2022. Could they put vote off until then   Seems that she is more of an imminent threat to our republic.  She should be impeached and more.   removed   No kidding. It s like they want there to be more pissed off people.  bitch  you just stole a presidential election using chinese vote machines. maybe you should sit this one out  The imminent threat to our democracy are the Leftists salivating over the oppressive and racist legislation they are going to pass.  Okay blah blah political posturing.  Can she at least prove if we currently have a democracy     quot Let  39 s remove our democratically elected leader to save our democracy quot   She  39 s deranged and needs to be in a nursing home...  Keep on Treasonous drunk bitch.  Is she really this dumb  They  quot won quot  the election. Biden takes over in 10 days. What  39 s the threat to democracy she  39 s claiming   If he s impeached he can t run again. This is about 2024  they are terrified.  I cringe every time I  quot to our democracy. quot  We are not a democracy  you idiot.  Why not run the clock out  Hey  this is unrelated to this except for the fact that Pelosi is a cunt  but has anyone seen a whole bunch of users suddenly start following them  I apparently now have eight followers  and although I ve blocked five people  I ve gone back several days worth of notifications and it seems like those accounts have followed me multiple times  even though I blocked them. Is there anyway to see a follower list  so I can get rid of these people  I don t like the idea of people I don t know following me on read it with the insanity going on right now. Quite frankly  I m tempted to nuke my account and start over  On reddit  Not possible  fam. If I did  I would  39 ve done it already to only get around 50 dms from lib shills who want to debate me or call me the most outrageous racist insults instead of the run of the mill  quot n    r  quot   quot c  n  quot   quot uncle tom  quot  and etc to get an amazing laugh  I have had a few randoms follow me. Strange.  Honestly  it kind of freaks me out  because I m 80  certain that anyone who would follow someone on Reddit is probably up to no good  at least when it comes to following someone like me  who spends 99  of my time and read it on conservative leaning political sub Reddits  Get rid of personal social media. Use a VPN. Use several secured emails. Use duck duck go. Do what you can to stay off the radar  Just as we had this conversation I got 2 new random followers. You can click on their profile and block them.  I am with you on that. We are entering a frightening period and we are the targets.  My life is dealing with crazy old ladies  mom  sister  wife  sisters in law .  I know crazy when I see it.  Menopause isn  39 t pretty.  Time for Trump to declassify everything...  The Baba Yaga of bureaucrats
t3_kun491,Wednesday was Americas Kristallnacht Schwarzenegger compares MAGA riot to Nazi atrocity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kun491/wednesday_was_americas_kristallnacht/,I ve counted 4 major public figures in politics who have now compared Trump and his supporters and allies to nazis.   One whose father was an actual Nazi.  This  Fuq yoo azzhole    He  39 ll be back....  Good luck with your FIL  Chris Pratt  More like Reichstag Fire  It resulted in all but one Republican withdrawing their objections to the certification of the election.  That I don  39 t get. They can punish Trump but it doesn  39 t change a single thing in regard to the election fraud  still happened  Wasn t the reichstag fire nazis burning the reichstag and blaming communists allowing the Nazis to get away with whatever they wanted  The only people who benefitted from storming the Capitol were democrats  It  39 s still unclear whether or not the Nazi  39 s started the fire at the Reichstag themselves.  What is indisputable is that they then exploited the public  39 s fear of a communist insurrection to catapult themselves into absolute power.  Yeah I read more into it after I typed that  apparently they believe it was started by a communist  but the Nazis managed to blame the entire communist party  That  39 s one theory I heard. That the left allowed or even encouraged it to happen so that they could crack down on the right.  It showed which ones actually believed and which ones were posturing to look better to their constituents.  It s like these people read one history book or are only aware of one period of history. Everything is  Nazis ... wtf are these people even talking about   They don t actually care about history  these are just words that they realize are effective in convincing people to hate their opposition. They re fighting  fascism  with actual fascism  Except Kristalnacht targeted Jewish civilians  while this targeted corrupt politicians. Only leftist mobs have targeted civilians.  This is an embarrassing take by Schwarzenegger.  It  39 s totally fine to condemn the violence from Wednesday but to compare it to the Nazis is extremely divisive  dishonest  and hyperbolic.  I wouldn  39 t expect anything different from someone in the Hollywood bubble though.  I agree with you  but I would expect more from Arnie.  He was a middle of the road republican.  He managed California very well.  Our DMV had less than a 5 minute wait.  He was all about making government workers actually do their jobs.    Sorry  Arnie  you have no fucking idea what you  39 re talking about. It  39 s a shame when people get older and still think they  39 re connected to what  39 s going on. The Left has been committing violence against people for months  where  39 s the outrage over that   Their real issue was that Trump exposed their game. That s what this was always about.  Smoke another cigar in your mansion and tell the ppl to stay locked down.  Except kristallnacht was a 3 day long event that hurt businesses and not the government. The night of broken glass is more akin to the last 9 months of protests by BLM that actually hurt businesses rather than the government excluding portland and the federal court.  do you guys understand that the left is literally rewriting history now  in the future they  39 ll say 1 6 21 was  quot the darkest day in US history quot  because we suffered a  quot domestic terror attack. quot  your grandchildren will read about this in their textbooks and I can guarantee by then they  39 ll erase all good accomplishments made by Trump  39 s presidency to the point where he  39 ll look like Hitler in comparison. this is already happening and it  39 s only been 4 days.  Truth  The winners write the history. Dems are playing for keeps.  Where was he when BLM was destroying our cities   Probably sitting in his mansion not giving a fuck. It was only after the elites were threatened that these people started caring.  These people are so disconnected from reality.  I cannot think of anyone more out of touch with the average American than Arnold fucking Schwarzenegger  It was actually more like the Night of the Long Knives when the Nazis cracked down on internal dissidents  or Stalin  39 s purges.  R pol is here. Lol  take yer down votes in stride folks. The more you have the more honest the comment... The left just simply can  39 t stand truth...  Another fake  quot republican quot  who didn  39 t like trump just due to his words.  Literally the joke of the internet  you know they have zero argument when they start calling you hitler or a Nazi.  He  39 s projecting to cover that his father was a Nazi.  Coming from a Republican  although too moderate for this crowd  I will take this more seriously. Firstly  Kristallnacht was not an attack on government. Second  it was planned. Third  it included paramilitary. So  nothing like this protest that appears to have not killed anyone intentionally.  Left acting like the  quot rioters quot  actually hurt killed politicians. Maybe if the  quot rioters quot  actually got rid congress members then this reaction we are seeing may be valid.  He is just pissed cause the new maid is too hot for him to procreate with.  How is this like kristallnacht  I don t think any private businesses were targeted  I lived in California during his term. He did absolutely nothing for Californians  certainly not for conservatives. Raised taxes  in fact.  To be fair  he tried to take down the teachers union  but failed   he tried to be conservative initially but with Dems owning every part of the government  he decided he can be re elected and become popular by becoming a liberal  Randy Quaid  you got competition.  The Austrian has lost his fucking mind. After this I hope he will  em not  em  be back.......  I used to respect this man  until now. He s just another pawn  all pissy because Trump talked shit about him taking over the apprentice and doing a crappy ass job. No one sticks to facts anymore. It s all opinions and misdirection. Shame on you  Arnie.  Stop being stupid  Arnie  Pretty bold coming from an Austrian.  Does that mean that the discussion is over  Godwin  39 s Law and all that   A dumb weightlifter  What a lunatic  My mom worked at People Magazine in the 80s and has seen pictures of Arnold s dick...he s the most famous micro penis sufferer in the world. Supposed to be about  2 inches erect
t3_kuronr,BREAKING Pelosi Gives Pence 24hrs To Activate 25th Amendment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuronr/breaking_pelosi_gives_pence_24hrs_to_activate/,Unity my ass.  What does FIFY mean   Fixed it for ya  Ah ok thanks  No problem  She is genuinely  em trying  em  to provoke a backlash.   removed   ill believe the special forces shit when i see it lol thats a little too conspiratorial for me  Agree. But something has congress flailing about. We  39 ll find out eventually.  She  39 s been quot trying quot  shit forever.  The republicans picking a side part is why i hope impeachment happens where we can see which republicans to vote out.  I mean if you enjoy spending your energy on infighting and purity tests while remaining the minority forever  Nancy is certainly eager to help you out.  You too can follow the California model.  Or maybe call it the Roy Moore model   In this ONE case  I just want them to have to vote because so many republicans have shown their true colors lately and need to be voted out. Including Cruz  really.  Politics is a team sport played over a long term and won by people who think ten moves and ten years ahead.  It is not about fealty to one person  the bruised pride of that one person  or substituting bravado for an actual thought through plan.  So you get your loyalty vote  then what   What are steps two through ten   What are your plans for the 2030 election   I hope you  39 ve thought that far ahead  because I promise you the Democrats have.  In case you haven  39 t noticed  the republican party has made tons of lo9ng term mistakes as it is and Trump mad is not due to a bruised ego  it  39 s because he was legit cheated. Had they not taken advantage of covid to be able to send out ballots  he would have won by a large margin. Notice the economy is actually at PRE COVID numbers already. he was successful in every area.  Doesn  39 t change that he was right to question things  especially with having been through 4 years of the left lying.  Its not about right and wrong its what you can do about it.  She s really into this 25th amendment isn t she   Too bad she doesn t give a crap about the 1st or 2nd ones.  You really think they would wait till 23 to pull that card  I bet sooner.  I  39 d be surprised if Biden lasted six months.  If they wait she can get 10 years as president.  Otherwise he d already be out.  Wouldn  39 t that be something  removed ten days before even taking office.  Works with the year we  39 re having so far  If they wait until 2023  they may have a big surprise because the republicans may take back over in the House and senate.  You think the dems will cheat less now they are in power   Forget Repubs winning another election for the foreseeable future.  Now that they can do whatever they want they can adjust the rules and even break the rules as much as they want.  The R party is done unless the people do something drastic.  Part of me thinks that way and part thinks they will get such bad voting totals they won  39 t be able to overcome it with their tactics. Really annoying that ALL republicans didn  39 t go out and vote and realize how important those GA elections were.  Don t forget Repub voters aren t going to be enthusiastic for any future election to put back in office the Rinos and Repubs that turned their back on trump and passed the shitty stimulus bill.  After the way a lot of them are turning on Trump now there s no way they ll get support again.  I am just hoping they get motivated towards some primary opponents for them. But sadly most of the challengers will probably be the same way. In fact as time goes on  there will probably be more RINOs instead of less because of the liberal brainwashing of society.  Well. If Biden steps down  Harris can t be president because she wasn t born in the states from what I m told. It ll be Pelosi as president.  Born in Oakland to immigrant non citizen parents.  She is eligible.  God bless this nearly gave me a heart attack.  Yeah  plus I  39 m sure they would have found a way around it if she wasn  39 t eligible. They  39 re doing everything in their power to subvert the Constitution in all other ways.  Oh ok. But we still know who owns who in this group of usurpers.  Ob absolutely but Pelosi has scared me longer than I knew what politics were lol.  Legitimately the wicked with of the south i mean house.  She doesn  39 t have the authority to force Pence to invoke the 25th amendment... That  39 s effectively enforcing a coup  which is treasonous  The election was the coup.  It  39 s their coup  so it  39 s ok.   deleted   I say no deal.  Mean while everyone who isn  39 t hard into consertivism calls Wednesday a coup. Which I mean is so not even close to a coup. If it was a real coup attempt it would be bloodier than one government agent shooting an unarmed civi  it was a coup attempt. by congress.  I  39 ve heard Trump can block 25th Amendment removal pretty easily.  By writing down  quot I am still the president. quot  or something of similar difficulty . That said  Pelosi already tried another coup option   a href  https   www.independentsentinel.com lest we forget clintons chinagate scandal the worst in us history   https   www.independentsentinel.com lest we forget clintons chinagate scandal the worst in us history   a   it  39 s already a coup. in for a penny  in for a pound.  Pence  Okay  Mike  let  39 s vote on invoking the 25th amendment  Assuming any court would hear the evidence.  lol she is trying every method possible to force a coup without doing it herself. first the pentagon now the VP. wonder who is next in line  Well  she can ask. I don t think there s a constitutional issue there. Is saying that she ll move to impeach if he doesn t invoke it an issue  I m inclined to say no. She has the power to move forward with impeachment  so saying  If you don t do it  I will  isn t anything outside of her powers.   It s almost like she wants to trigger a civil war.  For the record  the purpose  and language  of the 25th amendment is to transfer executive power to the Vice President when the President is UNABLE to govern  NOT because some assholes got out of control loosely based on a speech from the President.  What the hell is she scared of that she can  39 t wait a few days   Her laptop was stolen during the alleged coup. Must be something really incriminating on it.  It looks like Pence got his offer of 30 silver pieces. Backstab Trump and dems will go softer on him for the potential presidency bid.   a href  https   m.youtube.com watch v sRotOC20jEs  https   m.youtube.com watch v sRotOC20jEs  a   If the insurrection act really has been invoked  it won  39 t be reported like this. It  39 s going to be a huge mess  and it  39 ll be everywhere.  I d assume they wouldn t want it known that it was being invoked   but your guess is as good as mine. It would explain the lefts sudden surge of lunacy trying to silence everything and remove trump with 10 days left.  It would  and it would be justified. I just want a better source is all  Yeah I hear ya... this video is way longer and talks about the same thing in much more detail.  I have no idea what to believe anymore though... but here it is if you  39 re interested   a href  https   www.youtube.com watch v kOPmA6m42no  https   www.youtube.com watch v kOPmA6m42no  a   The house neutered the president s ability to invoke the insurrection act as part of last summer s NDAA.

They are just days away from Biden being sworn in and can taste the pardons.  My thoughts exactly  she kicked it into overdrive after that laptop story came out. False hope I m sure but one could only hope this useless bitch gets what s coming.  Or...  em what   em   Whatever was on that computer that the white hats got during the capitol operation  she clearly is terrified of it.   Nancy should  39 ve been more worried about the 28th amendment and maybe we wouldn  39 t find ourselves in this mess.  The pendulum swings...  We  39 ve seen the low esteem in which the Democrats hold the Constitution but since when does the House have the authority to order the Vice President to do squat  She is one evil cow.  How vulgar and descriptive does reddit allow you to be  Asking for a friend.   deleted   Can confirm.  They want Trump impeached so he can t run again in 2024. Sure  Trump is out of office now. But now we have Biden and his policies. Let s see how much people REALLY like his Kamalas policies. 4 years of that shit and people are gonna be BEGGING for the trump economy to be back  Adding Puerto Rico and DC as states further cements their hold on power. Once done getting a republican more than 25  of a vote is unlikely. And of course there is already a bill ready to file to remove the electoral college. Hello communism.  Wait until he raises their taxes  the economy falls apart  and unemployment skyrockets.  The next few years are about guararnteed to be crazy in some way or another with those crazies running things. lol. I bet we start seeing dems in congress literally having mental breakdowns. They are so crazy now.  This woman prays not to God  but rather to Satan. With whom she conspires against our nation. Pence will not mobilize anything and activate nothing. Impeachment attempt will go nowhere.   As long as we prioritize our our jobs and income over our freedom.  Just stfu for like  5 minutes. Please.  Just a dry run to 25th amendment Sleepy Creepy. Not only do they get Kameka  the authoritarian crackpot as president  but they get to spew  country over party  until they re dying days.  I hope Pence tells her to shove it up her ass and stands with Trump.  soooo why is she stating some ultimatum bs threat to pence  if he says no  then what  she impeaches trump  again  and it goes to the senate where  unless they are fucking complete and total morons  would vote to deny it.... again   Are we sure senate would vote it down   If they vote to impeach him the party will 100  split. Granted  politicians are so removed from normal people i wouldnt be surprised if they did vote to  I kind of expect a few Republicans to switch sides. They have know that we will never vote for them again so a reasonable choice would be to flip.  Or what  Nan   She  39 ll make harsh comments of CNN  Who cares. She should outlaw poverty and suffering while she  39 s at it.  Trump needs to declare Martial law over this.  Trek that sack of wrinkley shit to suck a fat dick
t3_kusv37,House Dems To Bring Impeachment Charge Introduce Resolution Calling On Pence To Invoke 25th Amendment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kusv37/house_dems_to_bring_impeachment_charge_introduce/,Joe Biden   quot We want unity. quot    quot I am the Senate quot   Isn  39 t he gone in less than two weeks  Why the fuck would we waste time impeaching him  US Politics is starting to feel less mature than high school government.  Impeachment  with conviction in the senate  means he can t run in the future. They are  strong not  strong  going to tolerate that again.  He  39 s 74 years old  something tells me he  39 s not Churchill or Groger Cleveland.  Pelosi will be 81 in March.  em Bilk Back Better  em  Biden is 78 and is starting his first term  even while obviously senile. Trump is in much better physical and mental condition than both of them.  Amazing how quick this moves but it takes 8 months to get even close to any meaningful covid stuff  To anyone that thinks these people think about anyone but themselves  I ve got some magic beans to sell you.  What s the rush Nancy  Is a certain laptop scaring you  Is the thought of a 2024 Trump presidency scaring you  Are you trying to precede with another impeachment  which would revoke Trumps privilege of secret service protection to plan an assassination    removed   Pretty much this. You don  39 t want to see this but they keep pushing people to react strongly.  maybe she  39 s fantasizing about handing him off to Iran.  Her military coup attempt failed so now she wants to go the legal route  Although the 25th amendment has nothing to do with what they  39 re saying  so idk if I  39 d even call this the legal route  Didn  39 t Pence already say that he wouldn  39 t 25 Trump   CNN is reporting he hasn t  ruled it out    of course  CNN sucks.  I  39 m sure Mike Pence is calling CNN with constant updates on his train of thought...or they just made it up.   He probably said he can  39 t rule out what he hasn  39 t ever considered and they ran with it.  Sounds about right.  If only the Democrats gave half the effort to working for their people as they did to trying to remove Trump...  I would rather they waste their time on failing to remove Trump for two weeks than actually listen to  their people .  Same  but sadly  their voters voted for this kind of stuff. That s what happens when you base your voting decisions entirely off of  orange man bad.   That is a message conservatives should be screaming   An interesting way to approach this would be to think what would happen were the parties switched  dems are united in their hatred of America so they stick together
t3_kufw8j,Deja vu How Rome Destroyed Its Own Republic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kufw8j/deja_vu_how_rome_destroyed_its_own_republic/,No better time to know your history.  Timeless themes of individualism vs. collectivism  racial tensions  tribalism  money and power  censorship  indoctrination and propaganda  free speech vs.  quot proper quot  speech.    I think  this relatively peaceful period of  quot cruise control quot  we  39 ve been on in the US is coming to an end.  Easy times create weak people  weak people create hard times.  Hopefully we  39 ll see any coming hard times produce strong people.  Well  excuse me if I don  39 t want to be a Negative Nelson about it...  Hard times create strong people  strong people create easy times  If you take the life cycle of a civilisation to be  250 years  America  39 s would be 2026.  One of my history professors  mid 2000s  occasionally used the Rome comparison.  Most in the class pooh poohed the thought but I could see it.  I thoroughly enjoyed his courses.  I have a friend who  39 s extremely knowledgeable about history and we talk regularly.   If you visit Pompeii you ll very quickly realize how Roman people 2000 years ago are the same people we have today.  Full stop.  I always tell people the human experience has not changed because we live in Western civilization and in the 21st century.  It  39 s one of the man reasons I  39 m a conservative. The  quot old ways quot  are that for a reason most times. Humanity is vain and prideful. If we could learn to see that we  39 d be far better off.  Yeah it  39 s just not true that they were dumber back then. If anything they were smarter. You think math is hard  how hard would it be to come up with it yourself  People also think they were less civilized  and modern people are somehow of greater moral character.   I think they definitely were smarter than today s people.  I think people don t usually see these thing because 1  most have no interest in history 2  they ve heard the phrase  history repeats itself    It s not just Rome and the optimates and populares but the same inequality brought down the French Monarchy and led to the rise of Napoleon  then the Tsar and the Soviet Union. There are many other examples.  I think it  39 s too late too. Been watching it for years but haven  39 t had anyone to discuss it with. Most are too blind.  Richest country in the world  the majority  independents  republicans and democrats alike  can t even afford an emergency  400 bill let alone a middle class lifestyle. Add in the riots  the Capitol being overrun  out of control politicians oblivious as to how they look  throwing trillions at corporation but only wanting to give  600 to ordinary people  not even enough for a months rent   a fraudulent election  the censorship and the media covering up Bidens bribes from the CCP.  It  39 s how every revolution starts. I mean if we can only get people to not be so dumb as go who cares about history. Shit if our politicians and internal bodies could see it we could end most conflict. Shit half of it is over small groups that got separated many moons ago. Middle East is a shit show because we didn  39 t listen TE Lawrence and backstabbed who helped us.  Lol  yep     And he looked good for his age too   A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within.  History has shown democracy is fragile  short lived.  They had their version of welfare fraud too. Wealthy families who got onto the grain dole decades earlier when they were poor  but kept accepting it long after they  39 d become prosperous. Violent gangs like Antifa ran wild under Clodius and Milo. Pompey made use of them politically and then abandoned them when they were no longer useful.  Its as if humans are basically still humans  even 1600 2000 years later.  They have...they ve come in the form of ISIS  This was the worst article and explanation of the fall of the Roman Republic I have ever read. Honestly  it was downright juvenile. Like a 9th grade paper.  Yup and civilization rarely last more that 340 years  and that s if they are lucky. Where we at   Ottomans lasted longer  although their power was waning for the last century of their reign.  Interesting   Virtually every civilisation that lasted a long time didn  39 t do so because they were immune to the cycle of decay  but because the successor state was an internal faction that had many of the same aesthetics. There were still civil wars  revolutions  unrest  and political upheaval akin to a  quot fallen quot  civilisation.  True  it  39 s hard to define what constitutes a  quot fallen quot  civilization. Longest lasting state was probably the Byzantine Empire  but civil wars were practically their national sport. If we just look at a contiguous political state  the USA is already one of the oldest countries out there. My country of Canada only dates back to 1867. China  39 s current political order was born in 1949. People hate to admit it because America bad  but the US Constitution really is an exceptionally robust foundation for a state.  It is with cautious optimism that I say that the events of Wednesday and the draconian backlash from it with backfire. Echo chambers breed radicalization  and a large bureaucracy is incapable of quickly undoing events it sets in motion. They only ever have one play  and it is using force against people to force compliance.  Yeah. There goes the ACLU s Twitter account. I m joking but it also wouldn t surprise me even a little.  Decades of political instability led to a wealthy patrician  Augustus Caesar  funding turmoil in 27 BC in order to  save the Republic.     To be honest  this could be spun as Trump very easily. Not that I agree with that  but the article is vague enough that it can apply to both sides. Basically like a horoscope  I m sure when it was written it was intended to cast similarities between Augustus and Trump.   This exactly. It s a lot like the Handmaid s Tale. I started watching it a few weeks ago  because I was curious. Strangely  or not  I saw the parallels not with Trump but with progressives. Of course on the surface  due to the religiosity of the show  most jump to the conclusion that it s the  right  wing that wants that world. But the authoritarianism and complete control was much more in line with what we see from  progressives .  Unfortunately  the terms  quot conservative quot    quot liberal quot    quot progressive quot  etc. are all morphing into being a proper noun for certain groups with ever shifting ideals.  It  39 s because progressives pat themselves on the back for being so secular and different to those awful people in the TV show without realising that the way they cleave to progressivism is religious.  Trump hasn  39 t made any assaults on anyone  39 s constitutional  em liberty  em   although he has absolutely expressed desire intent to  quot bend quot  it  which is where he has gotten in a lot of hot water  to put it mildly .  Hyperbole  you get the drift tho   quot I AM THE SENATE  quot   Yea that is eerily similar to this last year. Democrats agitated the public and then told them is was Trump s fault.  Perhaps earlier in Rome  39 s history  the Gracchi brothers of the 2nd Century BC who attempted to stear Rome away from the mire of its own establishment swamp.  Kinda like RFK and JFK   Is that why JFK was assassinated    em  quot If they can whack a president  they can whack a president of a union quot   em   As someone above said  I view Trump as Tiberius Gracchus.  Hasn  39 t been murdered yet but most everything else fits.  He warned the corrupt establishment of what was happening and urge them to turn away from they  39 re dangerous course  which was primarily driven by self enrichment via cheap labor and foreign adventuring which while overall detrimental to a society is very beneficial to bulbous military officialdom and the military suppliers.  I think many are mischaracterizing Trump. He has done a lot of good policy wise  and his populism is genuine  but let  39 s not pretend he  39 s some prophetic messiah. These last days  and months  really  Trump has definitely been pushing the boundaries a bit too hard  and saying things that are blatantly just not true.  I severely doubt trump will ever murder anyone in the future  but yeah you re right about the comparison  Tiberius Gracchus was beaten to death by senators who were wielding table legs  Badass  On this topic please listen to Dan Carlin Hardcore Hiatory Addendum podcast number 2 where he and another Roman historian address this question head on.  Let  39 s not forget that the Roman republic fell to a Populist leader who took advantage of the poorest citizens to seize power. Not only that but one of the main reasons Caesar couldn  39 t give up power was because of all of his shady dealings that would have meant he would have been fully persecuted once he left office.   Similarities  Is Trump NOT giving up power    If he had the support of the military or even the majority of the American people it seems rather obvious trump wouldn  39 t be giving up power. He  39 s just giving it up because he has no other option.   There is more at work than  support of the people  because the people aren t in control  they just don t know it  All of the people I cited have become rich during public service  except for Hunter  who s done so by proximity to his father . Joe Biden has multiple questionable dealings  from the Bank Of Delaware loans to his involvement in Ukraine policy making when Hunter was raking in 50K a month as an energy exec. I could go further but frankly I m tired and this is not a debate forum. I really shouldn t have to explain this to a  Reagan Conservative   Ronald Reagan spoke often of the dangers of an intrusive government.

What does any of that have to do the Roman republic empire  You do know that  39 s what you replied to right   I hate this drivel  em so much.  em   We can draw only the most superficial similarities between our situation and that of ancient Rome.

I already consider Canada a TeRrOrIsT OrGaNiZaTiOn so hey sorry buddy  eh  Can Proud Boys sue the government   They can but justice is not delivered based on law the way it s written. Our kangaroo courts will pass judgments based on the laws of virtues   whatever the hell that might be. See Michael Flinn s case history for an example.  Do they even go to Canada   What exactly is the point of this   There is a Canadian arm of the proud boys.  Wtf the Proud Boys don t even exist in Canada. Funny how also Canada has yet to officially declare ISIS a terrorist organization  Well  Canada has been a pile of idiots for a while now  so whatever.  Like anyone takes what Canada says seriously  or listens to them to begin with.  You really should.  With the largest undefended border in the world  and the simple fact that the Canadian military is training Chinese soldiers on how we wage war... And Justin Trudeau admiring the Chinese dictatorship... yea... the US really REALLY needs to pay more attention to Canada.  I get it and not to sound arrogant  but with the   of gun owners in the US alone  I do not fear invasion. Add to that the fact that their military is puny  to say the least  when compared to the US. A quick internet search will display the many ways in which Canada is by far inferior to the US militarily.  so does this mean we can label canadians as terrorists too   Canada still belong to the UK

Everything good will be credited to Biden  Harris  and Obama...still.  Yep. The narrative will be  Trump led us into Covid...Biden led us out.   That might be an actual CNN headline.  Thanks  I threw up in my mouth...  Just preparing for the inevitable lol.  Easy  blame his staff  blame his voters. They will keep blaming the Nazis that only they can see  and in the process of doing so they will divide the nation to the point of breaking.  Obama spent 8 years blaming Bush for his failures  so I am guessing Biden and Harris are going to blame Trump  his administration  the Republicans  and white people.  Goddamn honkeys.  Spoiler alert   Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley apparently  If they blame Cruz instead of trump they instantly raise him to presidential   Fuck that. Nothing is my fault and you re racist for telling me to introspect     Blame the trump voters.  CEOs of any corporation that doesn  39 t toe the line.  It will be like Kungflu contact tracing.

Popular speech doesn  39 t need protection.  Yup. But the acou hadn  39 t been that bold  righteous organization for years  which is why I pulled my monthly donations to them many years back   when they refused to protect 2A rights.  Didn  39 t the ACLU fight for the NRA a few years back   They supported them only as a  quot non profit quot  because Cuomo was attacking other organizations  such as insurance companies  that do business with the NRA.  Ok thanks.  They also refused to take up a recent Virginia law that restricted gun purchases to anyone under the age of 21  because  studies show that people do not have a fully developed intellect to make such a dangerous purpose   paraphrasing   slightly .   Your paraphrasing was good. The article I posted says exactly that.  Long time ago.  They sold out on the 1A and 2A in favor of lefty good boy points.  They never sold out.  They were founded as the legal arm of Communist Party USA.  This isn  39 t their purpose.  They are worried about the pendulum swinging the other way and taking out the commies.  ACLU has always been the legal arm of Communist Party USA.  They just take token causes like this one to appear non partisan.  Leftists populists know they  39 re next when all the righties are purged.  It shouldn  39 t be a position of the right  should be a position off all Americans.  Democrats have no integrity though and their useful idiots agree without question  I was going to say the same thing.  Too little  too late from them. They used to defend free speech for everybody  including the right. Not so much as of late.  Yeah  it means a lot that the ACLU finally bolts out of the gate now that the race is over.  If free speech was so cherished  where were they when TD was banned   When Alex Jones was depersoned    The ACLU actually spoke out  admittedly weakly  when Alex Jones was depersoned  If it can happen to Jones it can happen to Pool  and Rogan  and eventually right back to the MSM.  The ACLU used to act in good faith to protect civil liberties for all  with the exception of the right to bear arms. Hopefully that will come back after their four year hiatus  Well Twitter now knows who to ban next  Here s the thing   Twitter was in serious trouble before the Trump era brought them all this attention.   Yeah I remember before 2016  Twitter was in a death spiral. Trump saved Twitter in some regards. He also just killed Twitter. Kind of ironic.  Wow you know things are bad when the ACLU is siding with us.  Free speech isn t  or shouldn t be an  us versus them  thing. The principle of free speech is for everyone  their stance is on the side of free speech  not  ours  since it exists outside of our flavor of politics.  This is what is so wild about the lefts position on this. They re literally destroying the Constitution  one amendment at a time.  This is direct cause of identity politics. When you define the world between good and bad  when you define yourself and all of your comrades as good  then when you have power  you can  39 t do no wrong. If you sometimes see some of your fellows doing something that you don  39 t understand  it just means that you are not good enough follower and have to work more to match their level of goodness.  Not just identify politics   our entire approach to corporatism has also done this  our default position of hands off capitalism allowed for a private tyranny to be created that has now silenced the President of the United States.   These are the fruits of postmodernism.  I thought 1A protects the supression of free speech by the government  not a private company   What happens when a private company decides to suppress the free speech of the government   Presumay also not a breach of 1A. The relationship only works one way I reckon.  I don  39 t know anything though...just guessing.  That is what the discussion is about now. Is it or is it not. We have become so reliant on social media and the internet in general. Also the tech industry has gotten so big that forming a competitor is kind of out the question.  It  39 s a question for a constitutional lawyer but I am pretty sure it is not. 1A protects individuals against the Gov  not the other way around.  I am not arguing from a legal standpoint. It s an ethics question. Is it right for big tech to do this  Legally it absolutely is.  This is what I was replying to  which is why I specifically talked about the constitution.  Yes  you re correct in general  but it gets very tricky when considering social media platforms  which clearly were not anticipated by the founding fathers of the US. For example  if you think of the social media site as a public square  then perhaps the 1A protections should still apply.    quot free speech quot  is more than just 1A  Neither is letting murderers and rapists out of jail  yet cest la vie   a href  https   patriotrising.com california sheriff refuses absurd order to release murderers and rapists due to pandemic   https   patriotrising.com california sheriff refuses absurd order to release murderers and rapists due to pandemic   a   This and the fact that Lefties who ve taken the side of the oligarchs keep saying the phrase  The first amendment prevents the government from obstructing speech  not private entities .   It  39 s also ex post facto law as there is no clearly defined parameters to abide by  Ask the ACLU if it  39 s ok to believe there are only two genders and then tell me if they are on the side of free speech.  This has nothing to do with them taking the side of free speech. But if they bitched about people believing they there are only two genders and got people deplatformed  it would be intellectually inconsistent  yes.   But they openly mock us on leftist subs for this very thing. JUST FOR VALUING FREE SPEECH.  ACLU is in an interesting organization at this point.  It feels like they are actually split between old and new guard.  The old guard cares about those free speech rights that they were built on.  But the new guard is the standard progressive talking point thoughts.  Since the ACLU is a collection of lots of different lawyers  they are split on what is important to defend.   quot what are you worried about If you did nothing wrong  quot    If someone says that  respond   Its not bothering people on  a href   r politics  r politics  a  or other subs who want to remove republicans conservatives from any public form of discourse period.  They believe everyone who voted for Trump to be a racist  Nazi  cultist.  So they celebrate this.  Add traitor and terrorist to that list now.  Got called those the other day.  They really didn  39 t like being called that  along with anti American   so now they see their opportunity to use it on conservatives.  Lol we are traitors for wanting to stick to our classic ideals while they want to change everything  This is a Generalization  I remember when this sub was a lesser know sub but the powers that be decided to quarantine everything or remove subs and funnel everything right of center into this sub. Not sure that is a good idea.  Coming from the side that couldn  39 t give two fucks about the USA remaining on top of the world.  I just respond to people like that by asking  When and where should I report for re education    While I find liberals very annoying  I don  39 t wish harm on them because ultimately it  39 s just personal opinions. But for some reason they think we need to be eliminated. We are the devil himself to them.  Realize most of these people are probably not American.  Brainwashing is easier without those pesky voices of reason.  ACLU twitter account now permanently banned for hate speech  Aaaannnnd now the ACLU is a racist organization  s  You laugh  but that  39 s happened with Charlottesville. They said something like  quot these people have garbage opinions but they have a right to speak them quot  then a bunch of people tried to start pulling donations and they backpedaled. Hopefully they stand their ground here  because this is way worse.  Kinda wonder at a dark level if there isn  39 t liberties to protect then there won  39 t be a point to having the aclu to start with and they  39 re starting to realize that the dark future means no funds  Warns...  How convenient for them to be concerned now our last check and balance is being impeached  There will be a conflict within the ACLU and their leaders will backtrack from this and say  hate speech isn t free speech    em Skokie v Illinois  em  disagrees.  Can the ACLU even show an instance where a left wing activist was ever banned for being a left wing activist   That seriously looks like the only reason they are concerned.  Tons of people laughing their asses off at Trump getting permabanned from the biggest social media platforms on the planet don  39 t realize what it really means  If these platforms have the power to  strong completely silence and censor the SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  strong   what the hell would stop them from coming after you and literally erasing your life when they inevitably find you guilty of a minor offence you unknowingly committed bc you  39 re not updated on the talking points of the day.  Wow the ACLU said something smart for once in the past 20 years  color me surprised.  The ACLeftyU defending Trump. God damn hell must of frozen over  Is the ACLU for or against free speech this time   Trump wasn  39 t the goal  he was the starting point.  The goal was always the people.  Trump was just the shield   em Twitter and Facebook have suspended the ACLU  39 s account indefinably for supporting violent content  em   That some in the US consider Facebook and Twitter  privately held technology corporations  some upheld bastions of free speech and democracy says a lot about the direction our country is headed. Free speech isn t free when your EULA literally grants your rights to the corporation.   Even before 2020  things were going that way. A  quot virtual town hall quot  allows a congressman from the west coast to hold communicate with his constituents from his office in DC without having to fly back and forth.  We should force PUBLICLY traded companies to obey free speech principles.  Important  If you are iPhone the way you stop Apple from deleting Parler from you phone is   What timeline is this  I  39 m starting to adopt communist like feelings towards corporations  Well now that the ACLU has said it  we can expect some people on the left to agree with what we  39 ve been saying the entire time.  The ACLU is an ally for free speech  always has been. Don t care about your personal feelings about them  they will protect 1A at all costs.   Always has been    Has their policy shifted or were those just internal memos discussing possibly changing their approach   Regardless if that s all you got  you got nothing.  We ll see if they say anything about Democrat run megacorps colluding to shut down Parler.  You ask  seriously  what the aclu is doing to not fight for the 1A. Somebody provides links  and you say  not good enough   C mon man   What   I never said that. Don t make shit up.  While true you did not use the exact words   quot Not good enough quot  any reasonable person would infer that it is what you meant when you said    Did you read the link   Because the reason link wasn t proof of anything. There was another link provided by someone else that actually had good info. I stand by my comment that the reason link wasn t anything at all. Before interjecting maybe check source material to see if it s worth defending   ACLU is no ally of free speech  at least not over the past 10 years. They  39 re busy labeling everyone right of center as Nazis  and doing everything thing they can to get them cancelled. They might be right on this one particular issue  but that doesn  39 t make up for what they  39 ve been doing.  What have they been doing  Serious question. I ve only known them as an ally to free speech  no matter how unpopular.   a href  https   www.heritage.org the constitution commentary the aclu loses its way  https   www.heritage.org the constitution commentary the aclu loses its way  a   Great links. Thank you. I didn t know they changed that much.  No they re not. They re a proponent for free speech that fits within their narrow window of what should be allowed. They re not gonna defend statements of  violence  from right wingers.  What non right wing major policy institutions are condemning this  Shit  many conservative orgs are being silent.  I mean... how many right wing major policy institutions even EXIST   Wow.  Pay closer attention... Aclu is about bringing in cash.  Not advocating for civil rights   Maybe way back  but in recent memory the ACLU tends to curve left.  And this is me being kind.  No they  39 re not. They used to be.  In the past this was true. Things have changed though and this is no longer always the case.  That is objectively false.  They had leaked memos about how they needed to   39 rethink  39  it  and just look at their response to Charlottesville.  They were at one time. Maybe they found their balls again.  A civil liberty is a civil liberty. I remember reading that they warned against the banning of tiktock for the same reason.  It would be cool if the ACLU cared about liberty  where have you been the last year  Bows a good time to course correct.  Lol so when they have censored everyone the ACLU hates  now its time to sound the alarm.  They probably realized that it hurts the left more than anyone else because they now don  39 t have a safe haven for trolling trump personally. The left can  39 t get by without having someone to bully  which is ironic since they claim to be the anti bully party.  Oh  so the ACLU is back on the free speech bandwagon now that Trump lost the election

H.R. 101,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuoh50/to_amend_title_5_united_states_code_to_terminate/,Got a feeling the congressional critters will all unify to make sure this doesn t happen.  Every election from now on should be a complete rejection of anyone who has served 2 or more terms. That should become our society  39 s default setting.  The problem is the republicans will do something like this and the democrats won t.  Yea snow ball chance in hell this ll pass  the only thing our Congress can agree on is they deserve raises and pensions  Members of congress got a  20K raise from the COVID packages  if I  39 m not mistaken.  Former presidents got 4.4 m a piece too  Interesting to see my rep  Brian Fitzpatrick  sponsoring this. I also looked at other things he  39 s sponsoring. Too bad they don  39 t stand a chance against all the swamp rats that will fight it.  Oh this is fantastic.  Good for him. Those are some major changes that sadly won  39 t be passed because of bogus reasons by swamp rats.

This about the freedom of our entire country.  White supremacy is their boogeyman  they have to make sure the base is constantly afraid so they stay in line.  That is a disgustingly divisive and untrue thing to say.  She is the worst Speaker of the House we  39 ve ever had and a total embarrassment to our country.  Divisive is a leftist term.  It  39 s used correctly.  Identity politics are extremely divisive by nature.  When BLM or Antifa protests  Businesses are burned down and stores are vandalized.   They will NOT stop telling me how stupid I am for being a part of Trump  39 s cult.   Nailed it. I  39 ve gotten so many DM  39 s. Not ONE of them wanted to have an actual conversation. Just wanted to name call like little children.  I had a few awesome conversations with some DMs.  See  I wish just once someone would DM me and be normal and want to listen and actually have a convo. You  39 re lucky. I  39 m in Mass. A lot of my friends are liberals. We can talk about politics and be fine. Someone usually ends the convo with a funny kill shot and we  39 ll go back to whatever we were doing. The ones that hide behind their phone and are angry are just hopeless.  They literally said we would be hunted in the streets   Yeah he literally said that to me. Clearly a troll account  but nonetheless he still said it  Right. I was more shocked than anything.

Nothing surprises me anymore  but yet at the same time it all surprises me  Report him to the FBI  Of course she does   to democrats  everything is about race.  Martin Luther King would be ashamed of the Democratic Party.  What in the fuck does that even mean   Let this settle any doubt that today  39 s democrats are the most toxic and evil Americans since the 19th century Democrats.  Even with all her ill gotten money  she couldn  39 t even buy a clue  Biden won. Dems won the senate. Why are they still foaming at the mouth  They should be happy.   Four years of hatred filled echo chambers will create some angry people.   strong You have to be next level dumb to fall for all this.  strong   Said the white lady.  Hey Nancy  I just wanted to say that you re white.  Nancy Pelosi is a racist  It  39 s honestly funny that some people seriously go right along with their so obvious race baiting attempts and go around repeating it like it  39 s truth. Like anything had a thing to do with race. haha.  There is no democracy anymore amid the blatant election fraud committed by the DNC in both 2016 and 2020 so I guess they made a logical choice if they chose something over nothing.

The Governator has shit the bed on this one.  By falsely using and projecting  the comparison first they prevent the actual comparison from being made and seen correctly  This is an embarrassing take by Schwarzenegger. It  39 s totally fine to condemn the violence from Wednesday but to compare it to the Nazis is extremely divisive  dishonest  and hyperbolic. I wouldn  39 t expect anything different from someone in the Hollywood bubble though.  Arnold was a seriously shitty governor  second only to Newsom  He was never a republican either  Don  39 t like the US    Go back to making shitty movies  80s and 90s Arnold movies kicked ass.

They may be a communist dictatorship  but they are a strong ruthless one. Trump went at Jong Un hard at first  up in his face also dare  39 ing him to do something  and they ended up de escilating and coming to a mutual respect. We weren  39 t friends but also not enemies anymore either.         Can you imagine either of them meeting with foreign leaders. Joe  where s my pudding  Biden and Kamala  cackling  Harris  A double shit sandwich  First VP to juck  amp  jive.  Historic.  Dont forget she wants fweedom  Biden has to ask China first if he  39 s allowed to do something about it or even act like he  39 s going to do something about it.  This will get worse for sure. They know the Democrats are allies of communist China. While NK are bitter enemies of the CCP.          Well he doesnt have to ask.  He knows already that he is forbidden from interfering with North Korea in any way significant.   quot C  39 mon man  We gotta keep up appearances here   quot   Have I mentioned lately that I think we  39 re fucked six ways from Sunday   Still no WW3 with NOKO    This doesn  39 t concern me near as much as massive implosion that will happen in the middle east.  That s because he knows he s about to start getting fucked with again  Outside of the chattering class bubble  there was a suprising degree of support for Mr. Trump in the international community. His national security policy seemed to be one of strong restraint. No new wars but a willingness to project power if needed. So in the rest of the world  having a leader that one can craft deals with  as opposed to one on a never ending apology tour  meant an easing of international tensions. Now with Mr. Biden and his Obama era policy team that gave the world failed interventions in Syria and Libya  we are heading for  quot interesting times quot .  People always said Trump was sucking up to dictators and forget the reason behind it. If we re all mean and shit out of the gate why would Jong Un want to make a deal with us  If we rub his back a bit and build up his ego of course he s going to like us more. It was always the dumbest shit when people made those comments about Trump wanting to get along with dictators    Please be the bee...please be the bee ..fuck  Trump achieved world peace. And Biden is already ruining it.  that  39 s definitely going to make the public want a president Biden.  Biden will just say  Will you shut up  man   and leave it at that.  Just another reason Biden is totally unfit for office  he s internationally incompetent.  what a great time to be forced to sign up for the draft  a biden presidency.  There s a new sheriff in town ... errr sort of.  Could you imagine Kamala pulling the  quot excuse me Im speaking quot  on Kim   Yeah  he  39 s gonna be a bitch to Biden because Kim actually wanted to make a deal with Trump. The outline was that Trump lets Kim take over the South  but he  39 ll make the peninsula into a state akin to Sweden  take the US  39 s side in the fight against China  Elite NK officials hate China  the mantra that they teach their kids is the US is a 100 years  39  enemy but China is a 1000 years  39  enemy   and allow for US troops to be on the peninsula in exchange for also securing his rule and nukes. This would also be better for the Korean Peninsula as Moon Jae In also wants China to annex South Korea in exchange of him being a high tier official in the CCP.  It remains to be seen who is actually running the show.  We know it  39 s not Xiao or Kammie.   
t3_kveqhu,The Conservative Movement Needs an Amazon.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kveqhu/the_conservative_movement_needs_an_amazoncom/,That would be good but we d also need a conservative Stripe and PayPal  Also a source of goods that  39 s not made by slave labor in a communist country.  Why PayPal just out of interest I m completely ignorant about them  Anti gun for one  Conservative content creators got banned from patreon  crowdfunding site . So they moved to a patreon competitor  stripe and paypal both pulled out from the competitor.  Owned by China.  It s just all ridiculous. This is no different  in my opinion  than not providing services to someone because they are  black  gay  old  female  insert identity category here .  Dan Bongino has been preaching for 4 years now that we need a parallel economy to the current big dogs  for the very reasons we are seeing now. If there was ever a time for folks to put their money where their mouths and convictions are  now would definitely be the time. Though we should have been prepping for this in 2016.  The only issue I have is many conservatives aren t necessarily standing for or fighting for the freedoms in the constitution. Yes they love their 1st and 2nd but fall short on freedom of religion. It is just constant  God s Country  and Religious rhetoric. If they could focus on the freedoms and constitutional issues I d be all for it. Don t need a pop up every 5 minutes asking if I ve accepted Christ into my life and talking about the end days.  I too agree with not giving a flying fuck about religion and bible quotes typically mean someone doesn t have a leg to stand on  but what does this have to do with this ad   And it is an ad.  Just the fact that Conservatives on average are completely tech illiterate  and a Conservatives Amazon would likely turn into a  quot Christian quot  Amazon and likely be obnoxious lol.   That s a great point.  I went to 4chan twice and would never return. Right voter is never going to take off as an alternate to amazon. This dude is just trying to capitalize on republican tears for a quick minute. And good for him  he ll probably make 10 or 20k then shut down.   The Christian base was once extremely dominant but in my worthless opinion it  39 s a dying base. If you look at the voting demographics people registering as Christians has dropped significantly on both sides but a larger percentage of Republicans identify as Christians.   What basis do you have to assume most conservatives are tech illiterate and would likely turn a site into a Christian Amazon  I think your views of conservatives might need updating.  I mean I can only go off the data provided and personal life experience.  You mean like what we  39 re looking at in 9 days   You mean that end days   Well I mean it was the same thing when Obama took Office too. Granted I think this time is far more divisive  I am not convinced the world is going to end lol. I do believe we are headed in the opposite direction of what our Country was founded on  but I do have hope that we can come back. I think this is the result of both parties slowly eroding away at our rights for many years.  Cancel your prime membership. It is the only way to hurt them.  We need a lot.....and it  39 s just never going to happen.  We can  39 t even get and keep a Facebook alternative.  If we had an Amazon  it would never get off the ground. The mob would go after any company that wanted to do business with us.  Overstock.com  Wait they only sell shit my wife would buy. I guess it  39 s a start though  Lmao this comment caught me off guard for a laugh. Thanks.   Somebody crowdfund me.  I might sound like a commie here  but I disagree.      Nationalization is a step too far in my opinion  heavy regulation should be enough for the cases of Facebook  Amazon and Twitter. You  39 d just need the government to move faster and less 80 year olds stuck in the 70s.  Nationalizing never works.  It drives up prices and removes competition.  That  39 s probably true. I just wish there was some way to recognize the  quot necessities quot  in life  and have the government provide those. Otherwise whoever holds the monopoly can make the common citizens dance to their tune.  And that is exactly the reason anti monopoly laws exist.  So much good they did us   quot It  39 s not enough that Democrats have cultural control and market dominance over products we would like to use. We need to give them legal control over them too  quot

t3_ku5sj5,Amazon reportedly kicking Parler off its web hosting service,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku5sj5/amazon_reportedly_kicking_parler_off_its_web/,bUiLd y0Ur oWn s1tE  Also build your own webhosting service. And while you  39 re at it  build your own entire internet. Build your own alternate planet Earth  since we hate each other so much here that we can  39 t coexist even on the most basic terms.  I am studying for my AWS Cloud practitioner certification right now. Amazon competes voraciously to corner the cloud market. The idea that hosting with them is better for your business vs setting up your own server is part of their pitch  and they aggressively outcompete or buy out independent or smaller server farm companies.  I think the pitfall many free market capitalists fall into is that they promote their ideas in markets that aren  39 t actually free.   Well  in part government regulations which were well intentioned  but poorly implemented have allowed these systems to be setup  just like the travesty that is American insurance schemes.  This is why crises are such bad things   stuff is implemented without good thought and consideration first.  Thinking that the cloud provider market isn  39 t free  or has no competition  might be one of the most stupid hot takes I  39 ve seen in quite a while.  You should probably study harder. There are dozens of cloud providers capable of providing a website.  I don  39 t think he was trying to paint it as impossible but that very intentional hurdles are in place to ensure a growing market share for aws.  AWS isn  39 t creating hurdles  they just innovate faster and have a better api.  Mark my words  future browsers of this archived page.  You think you  39 re safe cuz you found your own galaxy   Well fire that warp drive back up  you  39 re gonna need your own supercluster soon...   quot That won  39 t radicalise you  quot   Site   webhost. Top level post already said that.   removed   AWS ought to uniformly apply the TOS.  Hello fellow conservative.   The TOS argument is obviously bullshit when the TOS bans any website with  offensive  content  which Amazon obviously does not enforce at all.  There are degrees of offensive. The posts AWS highlighted that Parler refused to remove seem to violate us laws in several cases.  You wrote this long essay and still dont know why these companies did this at the same time  Hint  it  39 s really not a about violence... it  39 s more about anti competition monopoly moolah anti trust. But orange bad man works so why not   This.  They are essentially functioning as a trust  which is actually a federal crime. Twitter  Facebook  Amazon  Apple  and Google could all be  em criminally  em  fined and sanctioned if they are convicted of forming an illegal trust. The courts could also break them up into seperate companies  just like Bell or  almost  Microsoft. Theoretically  executives could be criminally charged if they knowingly participated in the trust  though this is very rare in practice .   Because they were inciting violence at a time when violent protesters just stormed the capital  and there has been chatter about a January 17th attack   Why wasn t action taken anywhere when it was the leftist calling for  encouraging or defending violence   Dude wake up. What do companies care for the most  Let  39 s all say it together  M O N E Y. Trump was just a good excuse to crush competition. These companies are providing a  good reason to break them up. They will regret this dumb ass strategy.  Serious question  twitter and other platforms are a cesspool of disinformation and hate speech that regularly have users breaking TOS  yet these platforms never lose their hosting service. I would believe Parler has a moderation service aswell  but given the influx of users  the website most likely can  39 t delete every single TOS breaking post for erroneous conduct. Hell  who knows if half of the people utilizing said conduct aren  39 t just shills trying to get the platform banned  Consequently  why is Parler getting the short end of the stick  despite suffering from the exact same problems that facebook  twitter  reddit and others suffer   Twitter doesn  39 t have a hosting service  they run their own data centers. In the case of companies like this  their concern is with whatever mission ethics whatever else they  39 ve chosen to go with. Beyond that  it  39 s a business risk thing  they need to make sure that they are not violating US law and if their customers are  that they exercising a reasonable effort to prevent it.  Uh  dude we all know why Amazon did this. Has nothing to do with TOS violations.  Inciting violence is a crime. If Amazon is sending terms of service letters instead of reporting to the police  they are complicit in the crime... or just building their own justice system.  That is not how that works. A site can mitigate its liability by taking reasonable effort to prevent and remove illegal content.  All it takes is for credit card processing companies to start refusing services and it will basically shut down any business period point blank. That  39 s the real scary scenario here.  I  39 m expecting this. I don  39 t know how soon but it will happen.  They already started doing it to firearm companies. Cutting off their banking services. Operation Chokepoint. Also  banks have been targeting individual companies  closing their accounts and credit lines. PayPal refuses to do business with firearm companies. BoA has dropped firearm and firearm accessory manufacturers.  Isn  39 t this what Bitcoin was meant to facilitate    That s what credit card companies did to PornHub a few weeks ago for hosting a large amount of illegal content. They only accept cryptocurrencies now.   ....there are several  a href  https   www.vpnmentor.com blog best secure alternatives whatsapp   rel  nofollow  encrypted messaging services  a   This is the scariest thing that has happened in the past week. AWS which hosts almost 50  of all internet websites  now has the public  quot OK quot  to just turn off whatever they don  39 t want people to see on the internet.  AWS has a ton of federal services too  action should be taken to protect government information systems  Thank God the federal government doesn t commit acts of violence.   s  Those drones strikes in Pakistan and Afghanistan are peaceful protests. lol  Dont worry  the children that were turned into bits and pieces were peacefully disassembled.   em Fiery but mostly peaceful death showers  em   Obama is the Nobel peace prize winner with the highest kill count.  Similar to the gov partition  they recently started a china partition. It  39 s separate infrastructure  but no idea what sort of hoops they jumped through for that.  Ironically  Amazon hides behind Section 230 Protections to so they are only liable to pull down content that is illegal once it has been reported and verified.  This. NGOs are scary things. We almost need to deal with them like we deal with foreign powers.  This has nothing to do with section 230.  I hear what you  39 re saying  and they certainly can kick them off their platform. However  AWS hosts thousands of websites and online content and I can guarantee you that their are several left wing mediums that have also violated their TOS and have not been removed for it. When you make rules  but only selectively enforce them  they  39 re not really rules so much as window dressing to cover your discriminatory behavior towards those you don  39 t like.  They re arbitrarily enforcing their own terms of service.  Parler its not a piddly little website. Amazon is going to enforce their standards more strictly on larger and more visible sites. There  39 s nothing unusual or shady about this  it  39 s the reality of being an enormous cloud host.  Ha this is the point I was making but you said it better.  It really makes you think this is just the beginning.   deleted   It  39 s parents responsibilities what their children should and shouldn  39 t see on the internet  not big tech or government. Just my opinion.  It  39 s called a TOS  nearly every provider has one.  The TOS don t allow anything  offensive  to be hosted on AWS. I m not going to hold my breath waiting for them to actually enforce the TOS and remove every website with any offensive content  including Reddit.  This is unbelievable.  What  39 s next   ISP  39 s and colo facilities preventing them from providing a place for discussion   I really think this might be a wake up call for a lot of people who don  39 t believe what could happen. I really think these companies bit off more than even they can chew.  I might be wrong but we shall see.  Gab s server farm may not always be safe.  Water and Electricity next  They did this in LA during the early lockdowns. They were basically shutting off utilities for those who didn t comply.  Things would ve smoothed over in 6 months if this wouldn t have happened.  Lefties are praising Amazon for this decision not realizing the implications.  Stupid is as stupid does  A week ago I would ve doubted it but now I agree. The fact that Twitter  Facebook  Apple  and Amazon all made these decisions in a 24 hour window    Zuckerberg admitted Facebook and Twitter collude to censor people.  Now we just have proof all the big tech companies are colluding.  If you didn t know it was a cartel before. You do now.  It  39 s about class warfare. It would be very bad for the political class if your rank and file BLM and MAGA person figured out their problems have the same origin and that they essentially want the same things.  Personally  I was ready to write the incident at the Capitol off as extremists blowing off steam. Don  39 t get me wrong  that was still a violation of the American republic  but the idea that these corporations can work together to shut us down is enough to make me think twice. The People aren  39 t just going to bend over and take it. If they want us fighting mad  they got it  me included.  Yep. I think it was the wrong move to enter the capitol.  However the coordinated actions this past week by big tech and the D  39 s acting in concert are extremely  extremely scary.  This is literally kristalnacht happening in real time.  I don  39 t know where you  39 ve been the past few years if you think things have at any point been moving in the direction of  quot smoothing over quot . It  39 s erroneous to view this event as it  39 s own thing  where if it didn  39 t happen then things would be different.  Politicians managed to remove the Sword of Damocles from above their heads  we need to put it back  the Capitol riots almost did the trick  in the wrong way  but they do need to fear the people again.  I agree.  I feel like we are here because the left kept pushing and pushing us  and now we are pissed.  Censoring us will just piss us off more.   em  quot If you don  39 t like Twitter  39 s rules  then go make your own platform  quot   em  they said. Then when a new platform is made  the tyrannical censorship hungry Leftists want to destroy that too.   quot Well maybe if you chud bastards weren  39 t so hateful and stuck on your conspiracies  we wouldn  39 t have to ban you. quot   For 20 years now everyone has been told   39 not all Muslims are terrorists just because a few blew up some buildings  39 .  And you know what  that is 100  true.  The vast majority of Muslims are peace loving people.    When will they learn  that big tech does not care about politics  they just happened to come for conservatives first. They knew that the left would just let it happen. Do you really think these multi billion dollar companies care about Black Lives Matter  and the riot at the capitol  They care about money  power  and the recent rise in populism on the right scared them. These leftists celebrating do not know that they are going to be the next victims soon.  Just when you think it can  39 t get worse  they take it to a whole new level. The last 2 days is the tipping point of the death of free speach.  It can still get much worse. Just wait until they start pushing ISPs phone companies to people they deem  quot dangerous quot .  Wait until your bank drops you because some leftist organization put you on a  domestic terrorist  list.  This is a no brainer for anyone paying attention. Big tech is in the pocket of the DNC  and is their Social Media Platform.  You have it the wrong way.  The bans and removals are only asked by the left and only applied to the right. I am not ok with this  Why are the leaders of companies allowing employees to make  quot demands quot  like this  If you don  39 t like how I run my business  go work somewhere else. Good Lord.   Amazon might be easy for you to cut  but AWS is not easily replaceable.  It  39 s hard to switch  but if you wanted to  AWS  39  biggest competitor is... none other than Google Cloud.  You also have Microsoft Azure  Oracle Cloud  and Oracle  despite having pro Trump executives  owns TikTok who banned Trump   IBM Cloud  or Alibaba Cloud  Chinese .  To express yourself via the internet  you need to do it through a company.  Yep.  And Parler thinks they found another server  but how long will that last   The mob will go after them too.  Long term  the solution is probably a distributed topology. Something like Diaspora.  They might have luck with equinix  It takes 30 minutes to fire wayward employees and they will receive 2000 applications for the position within an hour of posting it. So if they  39 re allowing it its  because they agree with the employees. By making it sound like they are listening to employees they make it sound like they are internally democratic and they get some positive PR.  I find it hard to believe the employees at Amazon that aren  39 t allowed proper breaks are the that the ceo is saying they demand they remove them from the service.  It is not the blue collar workers at the distribution centers that made the demand  they probably have no idea Parlor is hosted on AWS . The demand quoted above came from Amazon Employees for Climate Justice  source    a href  https   twitter.com AMZNforClimate status 1347799256883552259 s 20  https   twitter.com AMZNforClimate status 1347799256883552259 s 20  a   . I would assume that group mostly consists of software developers  ux designers  program managers  and other degreed professionals  all of whom get paid very well and have good access to restrooms.   deleted   This isn  39 t about demands for removal. This is about doing things Democrats want because Democrats are about to have both branches of Congress and the presidency  and if they didn  39 t crack down on things like this Democrats would come down on them.  What do you use in place of Amazon   I currently use them a lot for supplies and they deliver quickly  but if you have good alternatives I ll take it.  My career has as lot to do with aws  and there  39 s no getting around that. Google and Microsoft are the only feasible alternatives.  I honestly don  39 t think there is a single thing on Amazon I get that I can  39 t get elsewhere. It  39 s all convince   I just got 3 1 oil delivered today because it was easier than going to a local hardware store. I won  39 t bore Reddit with my personal problems on why I couldn  39 t get to the store  but next time I  39 ll wait until I can.  Amazon was a godsend for me when it came to prominence.  I live independently  but I m also visually disabled and can t drive much.  Being able to have anything shipped to me fast is borderline required.    Well you can go to any other store. Costco  Walmart  Target  etc. They all provide online shopping and  quot free quot  shipping for a certain threshold. Not sure about speed of supplies  but Amazon is hit and miss on that as it is.  They  39 re making their big move. It  39 s the one sweep attempt to wipe conservatism off the planet by disenfranchising all conservative voices for good. I believe in free market principles but in absolutely no way does any of this constitute  quot free quot . A market that  39 s most free for the people is one that is regulated and restrained from not just anti competitive behavior  but infringing on the exercise of freedom by the American people.  My theory is that they want to socially isolate conservatives  in an already dark and isolated time  in order to push them to act out and fall into the trap of escalating rhetoric or making threats. People do irrational things when led to believe that they re cornered with no recourse.  The precedent this sets is bad.  Just remember that none of the  quot hate speech quot  or  quot calls for violence quot  is coming from the left. They can be as racist and violent as they like with zero concern about ever being banned deplatformed  the media will either ignore or downplay it. The left are authoritarians and they  39 ve controlled the media in a way that makes it hard to get that message out  I keep hoping people other than conservatives will begin to understand what  39 s happening and rebuke the anti free speech authoritarian left.  This is the scariest example of slippery slope imaginable.  I think a great question to be answered right now is when are Conservatives actually going to do something about these things  We can sit around here all day talking about how bad the Left has become and is  but that obviously won t do anything. For the past 20 years I m sure you could make an argument that it s been even longer than 20 years   the Establishment both Republican and Democrat have continuously trampled on our rights from the Patriot Act to today and we have not done anything to stop it. We all know that 99  of Congress are either corrupted or have no spine  so why don t we do anything. It s not like one day they re gonna wake up and say  oh  conservatives say we need to stop so I guess we ll stop .  Anyone who tries to tell me the left isint authouritarian is just declaring they are fucking stupid or all in favour of this kind of censorship.  Maybe we need to go really old fashion and mail letters and have conservative newspapers aggregating comments  like letters to the editors .  For now.  If we did that the left would find some excuse to read it because  we can t have those terrorists using the USPS to plan their violent insurrection   Just cancelled my Amazon music subscription. Fuck them.  Make sure you tell them why  I did.  Let us know how deezer works out  These leftists really don t want anyone to show them how bad their ideas are and how disastrous the results have been.  Because they can t win the battle of ideas  they ve decided to cheat and treat Parler differently than they re treating everyone else.   And with a Dem Congress and packed courts it will go nowhere.  They seem to have out thought the next moves.  They don t have packed courts  though. The GOP pushed thru hundreds of originalist federal judges over the last 4 years.   Packing the courts means congress with a simple majority can change the number of judges on appeals courts and the supreme court. Once they increase the number of seats  they load them up with judicial activists.  The two races in Georgia saw the GOP candidates recieving more votes than any GOP candidate  including presidents  in the history of Georgia besides Trump this year  and despite being a run off with no presidential candidates  they still got 87  of the votes Trump did this year as well .  Voting was made easy. Georgia implemented auto registration and mass mail in ballots.  Manchin has said he is against it. Even Biden said he is initially against it.  And when Manchin is offered to have his book sell 3 million copies he will flip. There is no way a single Democrat would be able to stop this.  That  39 s not what  quot packing the court quot  means.  They re agitating for some shit they ll live to regret.        Yeah at a certain point you  39 re threatening people  39 s livelihood. As if silencing wasn  39 t enough of a call to arms.  I don  39 t see how this isn  39 t an antitrust issue.   Sane left  Is that like jumbo shrimp   Military Intelligence.  Two words combined that can  39 t make sense.  Possibly  I  39 ve seen too much.  I  39 ve met a few sane leftists  surprisingly. They and I disagreed but we both respected each other  39 s differences in opinions.   This ends one way  Damn  shit  39 s about to get ugly really fast.  Planning on it.  Liberals who are here to troll  I need you to seriously take a day to think about this.  lol. Remember they claimed to be the party to  quot bring everyone together quot . I  39 m sure trying to take away half the country  39 s ability to speak will get them to like the libs more. And then all those conservative talk shows hosts and dems in congress who are using all of their time to condemn trump  who did nothing wrong  instead of condemning the ones whoa re overreacting. None of this was done to the liberal rioters.  Hey  if people can  39 t hear the other party publicly complain  the silent room sure sounds unified  right   This is such BS.   Nope. They are making the moves now. Elections are going to be leftist candidates that have a direct line to every single Americans notification bar VS the candidate conservative  that is banned and blocked from every technological avenue. And they will just tell the conservative candidate to make their own phones  and operating systems  web hosting services  apps  etc  like thats possible for even the richest of candidates. Democracy is in it  39 s death throes.  What a sad reality of what the internet has become.    This is what i was thinking 2024  39 s election will be like. Whoever the Republican candidate is will more than likely be banned and censored for pretended offenses making it hard for them to crowd fund and organize with their voting base. Big tech is already attacking independent political creators like sargon  dave cullen  amp  tim pool. It will be blantant big tech election interference. I  39 m calling it now if this censorship continues and it will we  39 ve already lost 2024.  Parler was warned many times that it should move from AWS before something like this could occur  but unfortunately they did not heed the warnings.  They fucked up.  They trusted Amazon to be an ethical company.  Can we have a peaceful divorce of states yet   We are China.  Calculated  collusion  we are watching the destruction of people like us.  Real talk  parler sucks. It  39 s like Facebook with no one I know  more politics  and very few hot chicks. I support the freedom but daymn it  39 s garbage  Well yeah  but like other social media sites  it was just in its beginning stages. It  39 s not like it has billions of dollars in funding  unlike Facebook or Twitter.  Stupid comment. Pretty much every platform sucks at first. I remember when Youtube was just a bunch of dumb cat videos.  The golden age.  Charlie bit my finger    Right  Let  39 s go back  No  they know a shitload of people are migrating to Parler.  Wrong. Every conservative voice is now there.   And memes. I  39 ll be honest I  39 ve not given a lot of time but 99  of it are related to politics  It used to be  but it was  1 on the app store when it was removed  and growing  em extremely  em  fast.  pretty sure now that apple  amazon and google have all collaborated to ban Parler  that  39 s conspiracy and collusion. it  39 s no longer just  quot they  39 re private and can serve anyone they want quot .  In the 1950 s the McCarthyrites were conservatives. Today we have the same type of actions taken by liberals. The sad thing is that the liberals are too blind to their own actions. They can t realize their own prejudices. They are today s witch hunters and they are too ignorant to realize it.  It s gone too far. This is too far.  This has some pretty significant net neutrality implications  It really has nothing to do with net neutrality. That was about paying isps for a fast lane. This is about hosting.   Net neutrality is the principle that every bit of data should be treated the same. The fast lane is only one part of that. If the data isn t even on the internet it doesn t matter how fast it can move from place to place.   Net neutrality is specifically about data speeds at the ISP level.  It has nothing to do with this  yeah  net neutrality was about the speed and cost of traffic.  this is about hosting  where you get to sit the website.  In fact  NN actually makes these websites more powerful.    That s not what net neutrality means  Build your own Amazon  This is straight fascisim.  But they literally have anti fascism as a member of their party  They can t be fascists     s  If I open a bar and say no fighting but you start a fight and kick you out  is that facism  These tech companies have rules and terms of service  if Parler doesn t want to follow them  they get kicked off  it s pretty straightforward.  The amount of hate messages I ve gotten from lurkers on this sub on this topic is staggering.  They re just going to label us all terrorists now because they will stretch the word  incite  and  coup  to mean anything they want.    It  39 s literally going to have the opposite effect that they want. We  39 ll end up with right wing and left wing social media companies  web servers  smartphones  credit companies  electricity companies  etc.  The left leadership doesn t know when they overplayed their hand since they don t have MSM pushing back on them.  This is a really good point that I didn  39 t think about.  If we had a more neutral media  they would at least get some pushback from those that can see the dangerous precedents being set.  But with a media that basically cheers on their every move  they feel like they have no bounds for their agenda.  Who is being cut off from every day life  Nobody needs Parler or Twitter or Reddit. Nobody needs social media  It s how a lot of people communicate  Ah yes  The Verge  the greatest non biased tech news site of our time.  s  My 2021 and beyond bingo card I created two months ago  Green New Deal will go through. Businesses everywhere destroyed. Communist  quot equality of outcome quot  critical race theory in every public school. No post Covid economic recovery if Joe models himself after Obama  39 s abysmal showing after 2008. Many wars. Kids still in cages since  omg  Obama built the damn cages.  del Compelled speech and even more flagrant Big Tech censorship.  del   So one of Parlor s executives said that once Amazon removes them from their servers that it might be down for a bit  but they have a bunch  of competitors that are competing to host them on their servers. Should be back up in a week.  I just canceled my Amazon Prime membership. I canceled Netflix months ago and terminated my Twitter account. Next I  39 m going to cancel my YouTube account and I have already stopped using Google nearly a year ago for searches in favor of DuckDuckGo.  It  39 s time we hold the left accountable to their own rules. Where was this hysteria when the murderous riots were happening   It is time for the antifa left and the right to find common ground. We know we will never agree on everything. That disagreement and different thoughts and ideas is how civilization advances. We should never get to the point where we can  39 t have a discussion.  Why isn t Reddit up in arms about this  Oh right  cause it s happening in the US.  Time to dump amazing  amp  use more eBay.   If we don t fight fire with fire  amp  use their cancel culture we will never win.  AWS isn t the only cloud computing platform  there are a good number of competitors. It will take considerable effort but I think Parler is not necessarily doomed.   em Reposting my comment from one of the other threads...  em   I  39 m pretty sure they use it 100   Out of curiosity  I was seeing what  a href  https   Gab.com  Gab.com  a   39 s hosting situation was. Seems they learned this lesson early on after getting booted from mutliple clouds  and finally bought their own infrastructure. That  39 s one heck of a money sink  but at least they can rest assured they  39 ve done as much as possible to insulate themselves from companies like Amazon.  That is a huge money sink. I can  39 t imagine building a scalable platform without cloud services.  if u are reading this  Become a parler member today  I just registered  took me 3 min.  I think what s important to keep in mind is the actual outcomes.  We believe in the free market because it results in superior outcomes to a command market.  We believe in free speech because it leads to an exchange of ideas.  Liberals don  39 t want an exchange of ideas.  They want it their way or the highway.  They don  39 t care what anybody else thinks.  If they don  39 t think explicitly like them and agree with everything they say  then they are the devil.  I mean I live in the Bay Area.  Try telling a liberal that maybe genders are biological you ll see some facism real quick.  There s a difference between being conservative and supporting conspiracy theories and domestic terrorists. True conservatives are not being censored  you can say all the conservative things you want. You can t say things that imply you will harm to government officials.  This is honestly what happens when corporations are allowed too much power. Those dystopian futures in all the sci fi media  That s whats coming  but china will be heading it all as supreme leader. The only thing that can fix the path we re going is action.

t3_ku3rdi,Apple is removing Parler from the App Store,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku3rdi/apple_is_removing_parler_from_the_app_store/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  rel  nofollow  https   discord.gg conservative  a   Next Amazon for the kill.  I wonder if they can find a new host. But hey we are all just conspiracy theorists right   Parler is getting cutoff AWS tomorrow at midnight. They say they hope to find a new host within a week.   quot You  39 re a conspiracy theorist if you seriously think google and apple are going to ban popular alternative social media because they have wrongthink quot    literally everyone on the internet  They re making some extreme moves for a guy who is supposedly out of office in 13 days.  It  39 s not the man it  39 s the movement that everyone is worried about. Including conservatives. The toothpaste got shot out of the tube  They will do anything but address populist concerns. Modern communications theory says good content will always find a platform.  It s crazy  as Twitter spouts shit like this on the daily. Fuck  they were organizing riots on Twitter during the BLM riots.  Yea I think both actions are despicable. The reality is the riots and looting associated with BLM and protests over the summer  were fixated on some court houses  federal property  and many  many small businesses who got burned out and looted. These fuckers said  quot hold my beer quot   raided the capitol building in which 5 people died including a capitol police officer. Not only did they raid the capitol  they did it to stop a constitutional electoral certification process  which was largely motivated by disinfo campaigns and of course the president himself. There  39 s really no equivalent for this in our history. You had half naked Qanon shamans and confederate flag wearers looting the building while our elected officials hid out in the basement. Seriously unique times  I really don  39 t think we should be downplaying what happened on this sub but hold the morons who organized this to full account.  I like this take a lot.  Basically they lost control of the beast. They spent so much energy creating a narrative so they could win  that they can  39 t easily put it back in the box.  Would take weeks to months to migrate to another host  depending on how deeply they rely on amazon services. Also I don  39 t know if any of the major hosts would take them. Azure GCP OCI IBM are all leftist.  Who host 4chan   Who hosts Pirate Bay   Pirate Bay.  Probably some small hosting platform overseas. But the requirements for something like 4chan are significantly smaller than something like parler.  Based on a quick google search it seems 4chan has about 4 times as many monthly unique users as Parlor.   Most controversial sites host themselves. Seems like that  39 s what Parler will have to do.  Probably some private ran abandoned bunker in Europe somewhere lol  They could capitalize by hosting the apps.  Not that easy to migrate this stuff.  I  39 m sure they can but the downtime is going to kill their business.  I think your forgetting their users have been mass censored everywhere else... ill wait and so will the majority instead of going back to the communist twatter  Absolutely. Waiting a week is not a big deal. I tried Twitter couple of times and nearly tore my hair out. Never again.  It grew back  right   There is also gab  which a lot of people are going to.  750  increase in users in 1 day.  Joined on Friday.  Gotta get used to the navigation and stuff.  their users have nowhere to go  Yeah ill wait.  You forget principles are involved here.  Where else am I gonna go  Twitter already banned me. I can wait it out.  Where  Literally I can  39 t think of a safe place online for conservatives  Gab  I guess.  I have yet to check it out.  What  39 s gab I looked on Google play didn  39 t see it  Gab was banned from the app stores years ago. You can get through it through your browser. They are pretty much fully independent and have a good shot at getting pretty big as Twitter and Facebook turn into liberal paradises.  Man I wish the supremacists would fuck off to their own forum sites. A lot of the shit normal  non racist conservatives get is because of these fuckers and their rhetoric.  Seriously  a lot of people hear  quot conservative quot  and automatically think  quot racist quot  anymore.  By design.  Welcome to the internet. You either get full legal speech  or you get full on lefty censorship. Those are pretty much the options right now  sadly.  It is really sad while I agree free speech including hate speech is protected. I just got uneasy about the idea of joining that but it seems to be the only safe haven at the moment.  I  39 d love some rich republicans to buy up the majority of twitter shares and then fire Jack Dorsey and censor all Democrats. The outrage would be comical as hell.  Is there still rich Republicans   I hear democrats complain about  Tax the rich  them but all I see are rich liberals like Bezos  Gates  ect.  Yes  there are plenty of rich conservatives  Republicans  whatever . They just don t want to get cancelled.    That s one of the only ways to fuck with them.  Unlikely. If it s the only place they have they ll go there.  Probably Oracle  Bingo. Hit them with Antitrust.  The swamp would rather take a payout.  But with all the glitches  An antitrust lawsuit would be appropriate  but it will be a cold day in Hades before a Democrat controlled Justice Dept. ever lets that see the light of day.  I don  39 t know  I think the Democrats know it  39 ll eventually come for them too when they stand in big techs way of world domination. Big tech just help them undermine the president  and if they do antitrust now they  39 ll do it on a high note  Antitrust is not applicable here  there is no evidence they coordinated.   You know  these are public companies. What is their answer to shareholders when these actions affect their stock prices   I  39 m still waiting for the apology from Gillette.  So why can t Parler host its own servers   Because that takes significant infrastructure that isn t available  Don  39 t like Twitter  Make an alternative. That worked out.  glad we can put that nonsense to bed now that we have proof of how it will be destroyed by it  39 s competitors.  Nah they  39 re going to keep claiming that. They  39 re going to keep ridiculing conservatives. They  39 re going to keep excluding and banning them.  When Antitrust laws don  39 t apply to one political side  what do we have left to rely on    Don t you just mean laws in general   I m seeing a pattern well beyond anti trust law.  I agree. When we elect individuals and entrust in them the power to represent us and the laws of the land . . And the choose deliberately not to  what s left of the trust we place in them   I understand the frustration  but how is it conservative to force companies to do business with those they don t want to do business with   Because Google is 90  utility and 10  private company at this point.  And since they offer TV  phone  and internet services...  I don  39 t think it  39 s a conservative or liberal talking point to be able to recognize when a company is so culturally prolific that it crosses into utility territory.     Not gonna lie  when some of the fringe guys were yelling this kind of stuff a few years back  I thought they were bat shit crazy. Now here we are...  Thats pretty much how it always starts.  It s happened with basically everything.   deleted   Imagine a world where McCarthy and Alex Jones we  39 re right. Bizarre  Alex Jones was right       Google and Amazon control major DNSes  if they wanted to  they could block replication and effectively silence it for anyone using their services.  Google is going to start blocking websites in Chrome in the next few years. Guarantee it. Apple will block websites in Safari as well.  Use Firefox. Use duckduckgo.  Firefox is as bad in virtue signaling...  Switch to cloudfare  1.1.1.1  They re a private company guys  Don t like it  Just build your own network infrastructure  your own phone hardware  your own data warehouses  your own OS and your own platform  if you want to discuss conservative ideas    Hey kids  let s build a power grid and start our own sovereign state     em mumbles something about Texas  em   I remember that Portlandia episode  Just build your own government  LOL  Probably the easiest option so far  They only own 99.9  of the phone market along with Google.  Jeez just use something else.  It  39 s a free market system.   deleted   Honestly it  39 s terrifying. I guess we  39 re just not human and as such we don  39 t deserve a place to converse or share conservative ideas. This sub will be banned too I  39 m sure. And then there will be no where left to go. I wonder how long it will be before all conservatives end up on lists and have our credit revoked  or can  39 t get a loan from a bank. Meanwhile  I  39 m sure there are many left leaning redditors reading this with pure joy hoping that day comes soon. It  39 s just sad...  They  39 re already talking about blacklisting anybody who worked for Trump  39 s campaign or administration. It  39 s gross as hell but people seem fine with it  Even if they did that  they still need the public IP addresses and DNS registration to operate.  There  39 s one step before that   they can go after whoever provides network to the new Parlor site. Lets say they put up their servers in a colo that has level3 as the backbone provider. They then get level3 to boot them.  If that doesn  39 t work  I  39 m sure theres some clause in the peering agreement that they can cut off level3 or charge them more  or something else that makes it not worth their while. Whatever Parlor pays their colo won  39 t be worth it.  And what will you say  when its your thought being policed  You openly allow a private company to control your speech  do you truly believe one day it wont be your speech they control    The parent comment was clearly sarcasm  The sad reality is that the popular sentiment is constantly shifted towards whatever the manipulators desire. What seems normal today will be pushed to the fringe in 20 years  then silenced for being a conspiracy theory or extreme. We  39 re starting with the  quot far right  quot  then it  39 ll be the moderate conservatives. Once they  39 re silenced  the moderate liberals will be under duress because extreme leftism will be pushed so heavily by schools  media  and social networks. By the end  it will all be extreme leftism as the whole tower crumbles under the weight of its own absurdity.  No  just go open source code. It takes time to make a social media site. The easier it is  the more you don  39 t have control.  Isn  39 t Facebook and twitter responsible for basically every single riot after an incident like George Floyd  39 s  Like there are so people who watch the video on Twitter or Facebook and quickly comment that they need to take to the streets and riot and burn and loot shit. Flash mobs stealing stuff etc. How is that not inciting violence every time it occurs  It  39 s not like people are waiting until the 6oclock news to see the video and then going out. They are not monitoring their platforms either.  Shawn King must have made 20 posts on Instagram the night Mpls burned  telling anyone living within a 5 hour radius to drive there and burn the city down. Over a 3 day period. Never censored.  That was a pRoTeSt. Get it right.   S   It s ok  when they do it.  Yes.  And before  too.   quot it  39 s a private company.  They can do what they want. quot   And bakers should be able to refuse to bake wedding cakes for weddings they disagree with.  So I have a question. I was arguing how it was terrible   but not illegal  that Twitter banned Trump  Parler removed off app store.  I don  39 t know why this would be a double standard if you aren  39 t arguing either is illegal anyway  but Twitter receives government protections and is treated as a platform  and now companies are engaging in monopolistic practices to ban all their competitors. Imagine that cake business controlled all the cakes  dictated how people eat their cakes  and colluded with other companies to make sure their competitors were silenced  that  39 s roughly what you have here.  Thank you. That  39 s a good answer and similar to what I had said. I also don  39 t really believe you can compare media to any other business  The baker issue ultimately came down to 1st amendment rights and the government imposing requirements on the baker. The baker s decorative work  and the baking itself  is an art  and he was commissioned to create art that he disagreed with. I believe the government s imposition of fines was determined to be a violation of the baker s 1AD rights.  The government hasn t  yet  told Apple Google Parler how to run their platforms  though I could see a potential for anti trust issues with Apple  amp  Google  given their exclusive control of their devices  app stores.  Oh  but they have of sorts  Except on Android you can install your own APKs outside of the Play Store and can install 3rd party stores like F Droid.  What do believe yourslef.  It s a bit more nuanced than a simple yes no answer. If the baker had a standard wedding cake that had all of the writing and decorations on it for someone to come in and buy off the shelf  he should not be able to refuse to sell that non custom cake to someone he disagrees with. In this case  the baker refused to customize a cake with specific language for a wedding because it would have violated his religion  but he did offer to bake a cake without those specific decorations. I believe it was his right to refuse to perform those specific customizations.  I know a few super religious people  and they basically have the same feelings you just laid out.  To me it sounds like how I  39 d personally describe the difference between a customer and a client.    It s different. They make the cake thing more simple than it is.   a href  https   mobile.twitter.com jack status 1037399105306324993 lang en  They even consider themselves a public square  a     perfect demonstration of hypocrisy  That  39 s not what that was about  and saying shit like that further spreads fake news. The baker refused to make a SPECIFIC cake for the gay wedding  but was happy to make a different or generic cake for the same event.  Is that not his right as a business owner   He didn t say say it wasn t. They were clarifying it wasn t because of the type of wedding  but the type of cake.  Ah I understand what you mean. It wasn t because of the gay wedding  it was because of the gay cake.  Yeah. The baker says he  39 s also refused to make porn themed cakes as well.  More accurately  the baker refused to make a unique work of art that disagreed with his personal values. He didn  39 t refuse service outright  he refused that specific service. Which the SCOTUS should  39 ve ruled on.   This is a pretty disingenuous argument  as the clear implication is  quot They can do what they want  em as long as it  39 s legal  em  quot .

This internet sucks   a href  https   en.wikipedia.org wiki InterPlanetary File System  https   en.wikipedia.org wiki InterPlanetary File System  a   The precendent this sets is terrifying. AOC  39 S call for lists of Trump supporters doesn  39 t seem so far off now.   And now  Im receiving hate filled PMs saying I deserve to be black balled.   I got 6 8 of them yesterday with the suicide hotline   included. I  39 ve gotten 6 8 messages in my last 5  em years  em  using Reddit. Definitely some hate spreading around.  I saw people on  a href   r wholesomememes   r wholesomememes  a  support genocide of conservatives.  Ironic  Yep. It s okay for Kathy Griffin to tweet herself holding a severed head of trump  but Parler is inciting violence.    deleted   Nazis used the census to hunt down Jews.  Unreal.   There  39 s open source phones. Especially the ones built around linux. Or you can flash your own flavor of android on your existing phone.  I already don  39 t buy Apple products  but just FYI  at least on Android you can download the app APK and install it on the phone directly without going through Google Play at all. In fact  when Parler got removed from the Google Play Store they just put the APK up on their website to download.  Check out  a href  https   puri.sm  Purism  a . They make their own hardware  phones  laptops  CPUs  that runs on open source linux software  And here I thought iPhones were expensive.  They know they have us all by the balls. And they re loving the power it s giving them.  Everyday I get closer to  damn I wish I was born in 1870  even tho I enjoy not working insane hours and antibiotics and other modern luxuries bc this big tech stuff is just driving me insane  Amazon dropping Parler from AWS is worse. Even with the app delisted from Google Play and the App Store  you can access it from the web. If Amazon pulls the plug it won t be accessible until they find a new host which might not even be possible.  Maybe another cloud provider willing to take the flak for hosting then will pick it up shortly. Really doubt anyone  39 s willing to take the negative PR sadly.   AZURE GCP  Oracle  Alibaba all have similar service.  Lol GL going with msft or Google.  It s not that easy. There is probably code written specifically for AWS that would need considerable effort to migrate to any of the other platforms. This isn t a gut punch that just requires you to catch your breath. This is a blast to a vital organ that will require major surgery with a low survival chance. And that s If any of the other platforms would even allow them to.  All of this would have sounded absurd just a couple years ago. While this next statement sounds absurd now  it probably won t in a year. They re focusing on content and app providers now  but I bet that the next shoe to drop is that they will start to control users. It will be something like you void your warranty if you have apps or if you access content that isn t approved by them  em because security risks potentially compromise your hardware  em  or some bullshit like that. Not only will you void your warranty but you won t have access to the App Store at all. Maybe they blacklist you and won t even sell you a phone. If you don t comply with their values  you don t get to participate in modern technology.  I remember reading a Bible passage about a  quot future quot  event in which a world leader demands everyone get a mark to show their allegiance to the one world government  and no one would be able to buy or sell anything unless they had the mark.  The left right now  I know we told you to make an app instead of using Twitter but you were not supposed to actually do it  Fine  we  39 ll build our own server  with blackjack and hookers   Big Tech expediting a conservative purge is a positive  not a negative.  I  39 d rather see the band aid get ripped off than a slow bleed out.  A civil war isn  39 t likely  thankfully   but this is one layer below  where conservatives are forced to build their own alternative media landscape.  It  39 s the only way to compete with the leftist monopolies that all of us  regardless of political association  so frequently use.  You are right. We have to build a kick ass system to compete.  Is there a non totalitarian phone company that doesn t use slave labor to make its devices  Been looking for a new phone anyway.  Slave labor is the key to making all electronics.  So you are out of luck there  Well looks like it s time to get good at calligraphy   a href  https   www.pine64.org pinephone   https   www.pine64.org pinephone   a   This isn t a small fringe group. There s 100m or more conservatives republicans in this country. How long are we expected to sit back and be slapped around by big tech   this is not a call for violence this is a statement on censorship and inequality.   start by deleting your fb accounts.  And twitter and Instagram  I ve been seeing  But Twitter  etc etc is a private company so it is illegal for them to do that .   Their examples are horseshit too. Saw someone say  if you yell  fire  in Walmart they ll kick you out and deny you business.  Technically true  but is Walmart only going to kick out certain fire yellers or all fire yellers  Are some fire yellers entitled to more leniency because of their race  religion  political preference  sexuality  etc    I know  it  39 s a private company and they can do what they want. This isn  39 t a legal first amendment issue  but it is a cultural one. Not too long ago we as American  39 s had a culture of being proud of our rights. The ACLU of the past defended objectively terrible things  but they were right to do so because those terrible things had the right to be. We as a nation have moved away from this  and it  39 s truly sad. The answer to  quot bad quot  speech in my opinion should always be more speech  not less.  They seek to kill off all online conservative speech until the only views are those from the left.  Apple has become rotten to the core.  I see what you did there  They  39 re all creating something they can  39 t control here. I remember that all the shit hit the fan in 2016 when the liberals thought their   39 conquest  39  over the conservatives was complete in Obama  39 s final year...then Trump steamrolled the lot of them.   Why would Apple  Amazon  or Facebook support free speech when our own government doesn t   Not gonna lie tho Parler sucks I get it s a censorship free platform. But it s just an echo chamber and what you see in the first 5 posts is just repeated over and over again by different voices also most prominent creators don t run their own account it s just their social media team  All because Parler allows free speech  just like Facebook used to do  Wow...  They never cared about free speech. Just their speech.   removed   Well   yesterday I made a Parler account. Never had any intent until they banned the orange godking. But I guess they forced my hand  Didn  39 t we just find out that Apple knowingly utilized child labor in China  My god the arrogance of these companies. The people who knowingly use child labor want to tell other adults what ideas they can and can  39 t hear. If Lebron were a corporation.  Someone has to file some antrust lawsuit on this.   Build your own  It s Orwellian censorship at this stage considering both Google and Apple have browsers on their devices.  This is how radicals are created. They ve been doing it for 4 years and will do it for 4 more. This has no positive ending   parallel societies and constant conflict. And the Left cheers them on...  Flood apple with complaints. I already sent them an email through their support website. Used the  get support  button in the App Store and called them out for their assault on free speech. The more people who do this  the better.  Tim Cook s email is  a href  mailto tcook apple.com  tcook apple.com  a   Email sent. Thanks   Steve Jobs  39  email is sjobs a  oh wait  basically people want to act like conservatives don t exist  The actions of Liberals by censoring Conservatives makes them exactly what our founding fathers created our country to escape.  This censorship is not only Anti American but also treason.  It  39 s treason because it goes against the very fabric of what it means to be American.    Burning books is fun and keeps you warm.  They won  39 t realize what they  39 ve done until it is way too late.  The leftist attack on first amendment has begun...  The riot was appalling and wrong  but this heavy handed silencing of conservative voices and view points is equally wrong and dangerous.  Where were Apple  Amazon  Google  Facebook   amp  Twitter when the BLM riots went on for the last 8 months   Most were openly encouraging the violence and no one calling for violence on the left was silenced.  Right after this riot happened I was pissed at Trump  still am  but now I  39 m even more pissed at the authoritarian left pulling this bullshit and am doubting whether I want to be a part of their America. I  39 m center right  not someone way out on the fringes.  I accepted Biden  39 s victory back in early November  actually hope he  39 ll do a good job  but this shit is so unacceptable and scary that I seriously question the direction this country is heading in and whether people like myself are even going to be welcome in it.  Will this case make it to the Supreme Court and be a watershed to determine that Social media platforms and all technology companies that offer a platform of any kind are indeed akin to phone companies   I remember reading a comment during the election day mega thread asking if anyone was expecting a mass censorship of conservatives after the election and just laughed it off.  Selling my APL Monday  What is their reason   Wrongthink  Promoting violence. Honestly though  I downloaded the app yesterday when people were saying it was about to disappear and fully expected a Trump Cult hellhole  but honestly found it very neutral  Absolutely insane  I can only feel that this will make the tribe of the left buckle down on their attempt to place more rules on people socially and publicly  which will in turn fuel this extreme right even more because it s effectively proving to them what their conspiracies center around. This is a bad idea and the capital was the tip of the iceberg. Regardless whose president  the social issues in this country will only get worse. America had become tribalized into Trumpism and Wokeness. Any attempt to be in the middle seems to be met with annihilation.  A few private monopolies  accountable to no one  are shaping  regulating  and curating the discourse not only in the U.S. but around the world. This is absolutely unacceptable.  This isn  39 t disappointing news anymore. This isn  39 t a  quot oh well  it didn  39 t go my way but life will go on. quot  This is an attack on democracy and freedom. Censorship unlike ever seen in America before. Remember how democrats were angry that Trump stopped allowing CNN reporters in the newsroom  That was absolutely nothing compared to this  and they tried to make the former a case of infringing on free speech and freedom of the press. Where are they now  Cheering. I have absolutely no faith that any of these companies will see as much as one lawsuit regarding this because in a little over a week democrats will control the house  senate and presidency. The supreme court is literally our only hope at saving any semblance of free speech.

They left out the Chinese government controls the  self destruct  button.  This could be hacked.  Not a great feature  This could be hacked. This is a great feature.  Guess China needed something flashier than cyanide pills.  Just in case the PLA turns on the CCP.

That spunds horrid. I am happy I live in North Carolina At least.  Bureaucrat Boris has been saying the NHS is at risk of being overrun since March. It hasn t even nearly happened  yet and most likely won t happen atall .  Why does the U.K. public even listen to him  he says one thing and changes his mind the next day  he lies to the public  fucks the youths education all while  keeping us in lockdown what seems indefinitely.
t3_kue1jo,OReilly argues Trumps failure to tamp down the angry protestorshas destroyed his legacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kue1jo/oreilly_argues_trumps_failure_to_tamp_down_the/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  https   discord.gg conservative  a   He  39 s not wrong. Pre covid trump  39 s legacy was looking like it might disprove all the lunatics in the media. Covid hurt his legacy  regardless of whether or not he was responsible. The capitol riots destroyed it. I don  39 t think he  quot incited an insurrection quot  but he did incite a protest that turned violent. That did destroy his legacy.  I don  39 t know  the economy was looking strong  and he probably would  39 ve won reelection. I  39 m sure Democrats would  39 ve still hated him but that was never going to change.  That doesn  39 t matter a bit. He had us running a great economy for 3 years  we hit a pandemic  he did a lot of things well and they ONLY talked about how he should have done better and he was fully ill prepared and only did things to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans. It didn  39 t matter.  I disagree. I think he would  39 ve won had covid never happened. His numbers with independents were solid.  Not to mention we wouldn  39 t have all this mass mail in voting BS. Putting aside the question of actual fraud  there  39 s no question at all that mail in voting skews things in favor of the left  because they have robust  corrupt urban political machines who can go round up thousands of voters  even if they  39 re homeless drug addicts who would never have voted in person. Just look at the Project Veritas video in Minneapolis.  For real does no one remember they just got done with the BS impeachment before Covid hit   I meant that the track record would be undeniable.  Yes it was. The media knew in their hearts Trump was a good president and their propaganda wasn t working. Then covid came and the lemmings followed the media.  That still stands  So like 100 people were waved into the capitol building by the cops and that destroyed his legacy  Okay I guess.  He  39 ll never be given credit for anything he did. The ironic thing is  under him we were closer to the world peace utopia they want than we  39 ve been in decades.  We will probably never be anywhere close again.   deleted   It did. His reputation now is tarnished by this. His carnival barker style helped him win the first election and many battles over legislation  but it was actual poison for this. He could have for example  repeatedly encouraged that crowd to be peaceful. That would have been easy and they probably would have listened. He didn  39 t and it blew up in his face.  I ve changed my stance on a lot of people over the past few years. But O Reilly has consistently been a piece of shit in my eyes... when I was a young dumbass who thought socialism was the way of the future  I thought he was trash. Now that I m older and lean to the right  I still think he s trash. Bravo  Bill... you re the most consistently garbage human being in media. Lol  Bill has always been self important and his goal has been to have an audience so he can be self important  If that is true then every democrat is responsible for the BLM riots and the thousands of injuries  dozens of deaths  and billions in damages.   Unlike Trump  they  em encouraged  em  violent riots. And not even in vague undertones that could be interpreted either way  I mean they openly and directly encouraged them.   removed   Lmao  we have to be strong  is encouraging violent riots  He also said they should be peaceful in the exact same speech  quit your bullshit.   quot We have to be strong quot . Wow  so much incitement. Advising Republicans to be strong is incitement. You  39 re either lying or straight stupid.   removed   It s easier that that  they are responsible for the current situation by exploiting what happened on Wednesday by throwing the country in a frenzy with lies  fear  hate and censorship. Every word from their mouths since then has been manufactured to destroy people and our country. Listen to their words  NOTHING Trump did or didn t do is even a factor in their rhetoric  it s beyond reality at this point. They just want everything destroyed so they can control us  The lefts gaslighting is beyond measure  To be honest   I credit Obama with the rise of BLM and their violent riots.   Neocons gonna neocon.   a href  https   www.foxnews.com entertainment fox news drops bill oreilly in wake of harassment allegations  https   www.foxnews.com entertainment fox news drops bill oreilly in wake of harassment allegations  a   Exactly.  quot Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. quot   I guess we should drop Biden as our president then too   shrug  Sexual harassment destroyed yours. Piece of shit.  Unlike this idiot  Trump has held himself to high personal standards. We were robbed in the election and Trump is standing up for us. Anyone who criticizes Trump needs to discuss what he should have done instead. Just sitting there and taking it in the ass for all of us is not an option.  No swearing publicly as a rule no drinking or smoking or drugs . He was a poster child for good living  Stfu Bill. Do it live.   Check out my latest NY Times bestseller  Killing my Career    I m not an O Reilly fan. His ego is over the top  he s a shameless self promoter  the titles of his  Killing  books are distasteful  and his past sexual misadventures are tremendously off putting .   Bill trying to get that spot on CNN.  Weirdly  his approval rating went higher.  stfu you has been talking head   removed   Here here  Yeah ok.  Tamp down when and how   Yeah... no.  Bill O Reilly s failure to tamp down his penis destroyed his legacy.  Sad that even O  39 reilley going along with the elftist lies.  And hes right  There are many people that disagree with this leftist rhetoric. It will get worse before it gets better. We are in for a ride. The right is pissed off at the communist leftist trash stache bastards.  I wonder for how many protesters it was just about Trump  It seems like they want to put it all on Trump just to ignore the actions of all these other congressmen and senators. Take Trump out of the equation and I still think people would have cause to March  You are all idiots. Who posted this  Stop throwing Trump under the bus. A handful of idiots that were immediately denounced and told to go home don t destroy a legacy. The leftist media is destroying his legacy by burning the 1A and controlling the narrative.   It s not about Trump  it s about O reilly  turning.  That we can agree on.  Russeman has his approval numbers UP after Jan 6th.  Legacies don t work that way. What WILL destroy Trumps legacy is Biden and the Dems. They will try to undo everything  every policy  every bit of good that happened the last 4 years. If Trump did it  they will undo it
t3_kueznj,Greg Gutfield announces this is my last tweet has message for those who like the purge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kueznj/greg_gutfield_announces_this_is_my_last_tweet_has/,If you  39 re still on Twitter  get off. I deleted mine 3 or 4 years ago. It  39 s been toxic since the 2016 election.   Leaving Twitter and the leftist places that take our money   or make it from ads we generate by visits    IS winning the battle.  It  39 s 99.98  bots  Yesterday I was on the fence about deleting it  I had only just signed up a couple months ago to follow Trump  but since had found some other good conservative people and news sources to follow. This morning I decided to go through with deactivating my Twitter  only to find out I can t... gives me errors every time. Tweeted support a couple hours ago  only reply so far is other conservative with the same issue.  Just get banned  problem solved   Deactivated mine in October. Was tired of their bs but didn t see this great of a purge happening.  When I closed my account yesterday they told me I had the wrong password several times in a row  even though I know it was right. Finally it accepted my password but then said  error . At the 10th try  or so  it finally deactivated my account.  They  39 re probably stopping users from closing accounts. I had no troubles closing mine on Friday. I imagine the mass exodus that followed the Trump and allies ban has them shook.  I just deactivated mine just now. Took all of 3 seconds.  What kind of device do did you use Twitter on  I just restarted my pad and tried again  logged out and back in  used the same password to deactivate  says  oops  please try again later   On my phone but logged in on my laptop and deactivated.  Guess I should try it on a computer  might just be an issue with the mobile apps  Mine said  sorryToSeeYouLeave or something. I thought they were happy some people leave.  It is a common tactic by leftist corps trying to prevent user bleed after being little fascists.  Social media feeds of controversy  if there are no conservatives it will become boring and people will leave. The same reason why  a href   r politics   r politics  a  comes to this subreddit all the time  what is the point of engaging in conversations with people that think the same as you  It becomes boring  Twitter is already that way. Conservatives don  39 t use social media as much  Let them stay in their echo  get complacent  lose future elections. It will be sad though as they try to spread more and more social justice  but hopefully not every big org listens.  I wonder just how many users they have lost due to this   They don t care clearly.  Because Liberals are crazy and actually willing to support what they believe in. Conservatives lay down and accept what the master wants. I bet half the people here still have Amazon Prime because it  39 s  quot convenient quot   What are the conservative online retailers  I m trying to look for alternatives.  Find what you re looking for on Amazon and then go order it from the manufacturers website. A lot of places offer free shipping or cheap shipping. That s how I did all my Christmas shopping. I ordered nothing from amazon and it felt good  This sounds like more work   Did you have to track the packages   My point proven lol  I don  39 t deny it. I  39 ll do if I have to but it  39 s worth exploring more options even if they are slightly more convenient.  I personally had no issues  most packages arrived via UPS and companies emailed me the tracking info. Walmart I know has started selling some 3rd party products on their site  meaning they aren t liable if you aren t satisfied. Not sure about target. But as long as you verify it s Walmart or target actually selling it  and not 3rd party  should be fine. It s a little more work I suppose  but worth it to me. Honestly I ve found the quality of Amazon s products to be a bit lackluster of late clothing feels cheaply made  etc.  Good luck   Why should they  Now when they cleaned the user base  they are reopening for business with right values to start to bombard the  left overs with. We didn t lose leaving. We won.  I ve been trying to deactivate as well. My guess is they re keeping people from doing it in order to protect the stock price. Illegal.  Mine too.... Never used it but anything to screw their User numbers and hit them in the advertising pocket.  The only tweets I ll miss will be from Andy NGo.  That s interesting. I read somewhere Andy also identified some Antifa. Is it true   Agreed  I can t wait for his book to come out next month.  Whenever I see a leftist cheering for this sort of thing  I want them to read First They Came   None of these groups have been allied with Nazis.   It is mind blowing how people don t understand this.  Reddit  39 s general population are 12 year olds with zero world experience or education.  Also  Reddit is a small population in comparison to the millions of Americans that are out there. Think about it  we live in a country with 350 million people and only 150 million voted. That leaves at least another 100 million that didn t vote. The left are delusional  I agree  but I also think this hyperbole regarding the end of our country is also disingenuous. There s too many people that don t have any interest about what goes on because they don t see any effects outside of their local and state governments.  This happened with Chris D  39 Elia  he was very vocal about supporting BLM and white guilt stuff  then got decimated by the same mob  OMG. That is so true. Thank you for sharing this. I have saved this and will pass it on.   removed   Deactivated my account as well. Waiting for Trump to build his own platform.  Do you know of any good Gmail alternatives  I  39 m trying to decouple from Google as much as possible but so much is tied to my email account.  I don t.  I have been using Microsoft 365  iCloud  and DropBox all alongside Google solutions.  So it was easy to migrate.  Microsoft seems to be the only company not engaging  which makes sense since they had to face trust issues back in the 90s and 00s .  I m completely invested in iCloud for family photos and media  HomePods  Apple Music  Movies  Apple TVs  etc  and email.  I m selling my Amazon stock Monday.  It s a crap shoot right now  but I m not blindly giving any company my business or investment moving forward.  Hell  I m even seriously thinking about running for office.  I censored Twitter March 21  2006 by never creating a account the day it came online.   The best thing to do is ignore the MSM. Their social media. They will implode on each other if they have nobody to blame.  For the last four years we have heard the Dems claim we are in a constitutional crisis  now we are. I guess they were just a little early.  Never been on Twitter. Cancelled Facebook years ago because they were cancelling and dioxins conservatives  back then. Saw the same leftist basyards on all the other platforms too so never signed up. Signed up to Reddit because it seemed like the last place left but it too has been overrun. Parler shutdown. Not sure where else to go. This subreddit will probably be shutdown too.  Carrier Pigeons   Right     Guttfield to the Trump News Network  Yes please.  Overall  704 Following  1.6M Followers

Putting aside the complete and obvious lie that is that statement...who protected you  AOC   Came close to something nearly happening  What   Lmao that part is already stupid. Let alone when you add not a single house member died. I don  39 t even think they were injured.  The more I hear from the Democrats  the more I am convinced we are headed for a civil war.  I honestly believe they are trying to incite a civil war.  In a time when they should be desperate to calm the population  they are pouring fuel on the fire.  I never thought I would see this happen in my lifetime  and here we are staring it dead in the face.  Best of luck everyone  we are going to need it.  How hyperbolic of her  Excause me  No members of congress came anywhere near stubbing their toes.  lol. what a moron.  Since she has been in office  all she has done is fake outrage at stuff and says ignorant things she had no understanding of over and over.  She actually made a video talking about her first term  quot accomplishments quot . It  39 s really sad. I won  39 t link her video but here  39 s an analysis of it.   AOC must be held accountable. Impeach the btch   removed   My eyes rolled so hard my testicles got sucked up and replaced them.  They were just looking for bread to feed their families.  Yes  Sandy  of course half of the house came close to dying. The half that was stuck in a closet having to listen to you screech.  Hahahahahahahahahaha wow. This is fucking pathetic  No we didn t  Yet they all somehow forgot all their many weapons and explosives at home...  Exaggerating a bit aren t we   So  wait  you  39 re saying people are dangerous  So  we should make sure to loosen gun restrictions so the rest of us can protect ourselves     Insert image of Trump thanos snap   Thats ridiculous. Nobody even had a weapon as far as I kno   removed   Ew...that  39 s a disgusting thought.
t3_kugsel,Months Ago Democrats Blocked a Resolution Condemning Mob Violence,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kugsel/months_ago_democrats_blocked_a_resolution/,Yup. Every single prominent Republican loudly and unequivocally condemned what happened in the Capitol building within hours. Need me one prominent Democrat who condemned anything that happened with BLM all of last year  Condemn  Shit the VP elect was calling for more violence and spearheading an effort to post bail for anyone arrested in the mob violence that plagued our cities after George Floyd. Cities released violent rapists  pedophiles and murderers back on to the streets in the name of covid. Looters were quoted as saying the looting was reparations. There are cities that renamed streets and public plazas after the mobs. Billions in property damage was responded to by saying they have insurance. The idea that Democrats care about the fundamental well being of our country was tossed out the window in a perfect storm this last year while everyone stood asside and watched the massive train wreck our country became.  When any particular party or group is against condemning violence  don  39 t equivocate when you get it. Violence is just that. But we wonder what their point is. Are you in favor of violence because certain groups are so good at it and you don  39 t want to speak up against them because you might lose a vote   Agree. Violence is violence. You don t get to pick and choose what violence is wrong and what violence is right. It s all wrong.  The left clearly has the ability to pick and choose  even support some violence  so long as it serves them.  And they get away with it because the msm covers up their hypocrisy.   quot By any means necessary quot  is their motto and shows they will engage in exactly what you described.  ThEy Ve bEeN cOnDeMiNg ThE ViOLeNcE fRoM tHe BeGiNNiNG  By calling trump hitler  and Maxine waters calling for anyone in the administration to be publicly harassed anywhere they go. Blm and antifa just did what they were told to do  remember they are just ideologies not actual organizations. It  39 s time patriotism and true Justice reform became and idea too.  They were all good with BLM and ANTIFA.  If the Congress is going to make a resolution about this  then Republicans should not support it unless it also condemns BLM riots.  Republicans should use their time to address the 6  months of leftist rioting violence destruction and demand that it be included. At the very least we would get to see Democrats refuse to condemn Antifa BLM and show their true colors even more.  Funny how politics always seems to swing around whether its the Supreme Court nominations or this

t3_kup8j2,Sen. Joe Manchin is open to statehood for D.C. Puerto Rico,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kup8j2/sen_joe_manchin_is_open_to_statehood_for_dc/,Of course he is. He was never going to be a wall against the democrats in the senate.  well he is a wall against the  2 000 checks  s  He  39 s a Democrat. Ie  he lied for power.  D.C. was created to be the nation s capitol. It is not supposed to be superseded by a governing state. As for Puerto Rico  there is an annual or semi annual vote to see if citizens want to pursue statehood. They ve had this vote ever since being picked up by the US...  And they don t want to   I don t even think PR would be that liberal give how religious it is  but DC should never become a state  If he refuses to eliminate filibuster  does that mean republicans can just filibuster the statehood bills   Yes. Who knows if he ll really refuse that though.  Yep  for everyone who thought he was our  quot friend quot .  We are well and truly f  39 d.  If Joe Manchin had any principles  he would not be a Democrat. Put a fork in us.  I m sure Murkowski and Romney are too. So it doesn t matter  Manchin is showing his true colors here.  If you actually think he  39 s a bulwark from the far left base of his party you  39 re a credulous rube.  This dude just doesn  39 t wanna get reelected  He s 73 I wouldn t want to be re elected either  Buckled already.  We are fucked.  Making these two territories states will be the end of the union.   Eh I suspect Puerto Rico could be much more of a swing state than people think  but to make DC a state would be nothing more than a blatant and evil power grab for democrats  How is this guy west virginias senator  Can  39 t they recall him  The population is red  they just elect this guy cause he built a reputation over decades  which he is about to destroy   DC won t happen and Puerto Rico has been stuck between half of Puerto Rican s wanting independence and the other half wanting to become a state.  Very few in Puerto Rico want independence. What most of those against statehood want is an enhanced version of the current territory status  Eh I m not too sure if PR would actually want to become a state in the first place... No matter how much the left floats the idea.  Pretty sure they are begging to get in  unless we stop them.  Which is funny because I thought the United States was a terrible country.  I wish we would just cut PR loose  grant them independence   They  being the government or the people though   That s misleading because the party that opposes statehood has been boycotting the referendums  So if everyone participated  the referendums would have failed   It feels they should either be independent or be represented  right   PR is very important for several reasons. The US has these territories for a reason.  Sure as long as Jefferson and Lincoln become states.  Don  39 t forget about Texas splitting into 5 states   Shocked I say. Just shocked.  The 52 states of America  Are we retarded 
t3_kuij07,Article Of Impeachment Against Trump To Be Introduced Monday In House,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuij07/article_of_impeachment_against_trump_to_be/,McConnell already said this won  39 t make it to the Senate floor until January 19th when the Senate reconvenes.    Lol a political party can put together articles of impeachment within a week  but drags their feet on anything that may actually cause actual change.  BUT WHY IS PELOSI PANICKING    WHAT IS SHE AFRAID OF THAT SHEH AS TO REMOVE TRUMP SO FAST            Nothing.   It  39 s never  quot nothing quot   Ok  then simply wanting to force a vote for the senate. See who has the balls to oppose.   Its never that simple.  What are they going to impeach him for  He didn  39 t explicitly endorse the riots  and he explicitly called for peace while they were happening. You can argue that it was just for appearances  but it will be much harder to prove that in a trial. Also  refusing to officially concede isn  39 t illegal  and all of his attempts to nullify the results of the election were legally taken to courts.   What reason   That was already answered by the last Trump impeachment.  There doesn t have to be a valid reason anymore   the only thing that matters is how many in the House will vote for it.  Here is what I think the real reason really is   I ve always said they  the Democrats  have wanted revenge since Bill Clinton was impeached.  It  39 ll be abuse of power  which is what they do when they don  39 t have real charges.  They can  39 t prove actual sedition so they  39 ll say he abused his power by doing x  which is what they did last time.  They  39 re not concerned about actually having a reason to get him  they just want to do it.  Gotta make sure they twist that knife in the back for good measure.  Has nothing to do with Trump anymore. This is their attempt at a knife twist for the whole GOP. Big Tech is now licking Pelosi s taint. You watch  this is all about getting GOP congressmen on record. Anyone who votes against impeachment is going to be  cancelled . Social media will purge more  more woke companies will stop donations to anyone voting against it  etc.  You re not wrong  What  specifically  did he do to warrant impeachment  Tell the people storming the capitol to stop  At the worst he was inadequate  but impeachment can only be used in the event of  quot high crimes and misdemeanors. quot   So addressing COVID isn t a thing anymore   Not until Biden is sworn in  then it  39 ll be about investigating Trump.  BLM activist gets released from raiding Capitol and they want to impeach a Trump    Wtf   strong  em V  em   strong  is for...  Less than 20 days remaining in his presidency  and this is what our representatives focus on while the country is falling apart.  Dem and Rino Politicos  it ain  t over   2 years to next house elections.  While the democrats play partisan politics  people are dying and businesses are crumbling due to the pandemic.  I see this is how they  handle the pandemic .  Pathetic.  Anyone with the knowledge  is there enough there to impeach him  Could they really be successful   Mitch said he won t look at it until after he s out of office

Nothing better than silencing people... it  39 s like they  39 re slowly making 1984 a reality  They absolutely love it and don  39 t even realize that if the President of the United States can be silenced then they can. And party loyalty won  39 t save them forever. They  39 re still not elites  they  39 re still targets and fodder. We are just in the way first and they  39 re fine with us being taken out first and subjugated. I hope sooner rather than later this comes home to them.  Why Anthem would do this is a mystery. Universal healthcare would effectively end the entire industry including their company.  The executives would be paid out once they close tho.  Dems policies would buy out exsisting infrastructure then put the framework in control of government agencies. Billionaires would be made overnight as politicians spend our money to fuck over our healthcare system. Remember that before the current administration took over the VA was guilty of letting patients die in waiting rooms because they were so poorly ran. That  39 s what we are in for under single payer healthcare.  I am pretty sure  they will figure out the way. Something like supplemental insurance.  Ah yes because so much health insurance is sold in the UK   So does this mean they will stop making laws that benefit these companies   If they were smart they would reach across the aisle to the average Joe on the left that had been saying corporate money ruined politics and say they are not getting corporate money anymore.   strong  em How come they never did that in 2016   em   strong   Good. They will easily make up the deficit with grassroot donations  by just advertising this withdrawal.  BOYCOTT  The list of companies that are considering this boycott is growing.  Boycott the boycotters.  It s the only way.
t3_kulpyo,Major Companies Begin Suspending Donations To Republicans Involved In Biden Certification Challenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kulpyo/major_companies_begin_suspending_donations_to/,Why do we allow corporate donations anyway   Everything that has gone on with this election should be a huge wake up call for election reform and campaign finance reform.  Because the congresscreatures who set those rules all receive large corporate donations   Good question.  Only donations to Democrats and only censorship of Republicans so Democrats can gain more and more control.   quot Hotel giant Marriott International  the health insurance network Blue Cross Blue Shield and bank holding company Commerce Bancshares  all told Popular Information  a political newsletter run by ThinkProgress founder and editor Judd Legum  that they will stop donating to any member of Congress who objected to the certification of the Electoral College vote.  quot    deleted   I think email snail mail campaigns could be as effective or a good supplement to boycotts.  Most of them are likely going along with this because their touchy feely marketing people are swayed by leftist noise on social media.  Make some directly targeted noise in their inboxes.  Guarantee they  39 ll pay attention.  So  they re going to go from almost nothing to actually nothing   Political persecution just like NAZIS did back in the day. It just shows how much unity emanates from their hearts.  Monero.

There is no way to fix that image lol. Her comebacks are funny at times but it always comes off bitter regardless.  Nobody cares what Monica Lewinsky s boyfriends wife thinks.  This is the only way I will refer to this bitter hag from now on.  If Hilary runs again  the Republican party should have Monica Lewinsky as the primary candidate just for fun.  She lost and spent 4 yrs going How   Why   Like a crazy cat lady  Apparently she never got over the fact that America hates her.  Why won t she just go away.

He said that it  39 s not necessarily what you said  it  39 s what the people who heard you talk interpreted your words to be.  If this becomes the norm  then politics is going to become an impossible slog.  It  39 s just outrage culture permeating into the highest level of politics  And as the left continues to step on the constitution and bill of rights  the 80 million voters that are pushing for censorship of Republicans will have their right taken too. Out of those 80 million supposed voters I wonder how many think that in Marxism they will be considered the elite along with zuckerberg and pelosi    removed   11 people died during one blm  quot peaceful protest quot  i didnt hear a single word about it mate...    then how about the right wing is full of nazis  white supremacists  that the police are acting like stormtroopers  that mitch McConnell is killing you by denying healthcare. that trump is a fascist. that tulsi gabbard is a russian asset.  No  that  39 s different. Because....  Words do matter. Kamala said the riots needed to continue after the election  and now the left is mad because they did continue but not the ones they wanted.  Every single person who gets arrested or questioned over why they went into the Capitol needs to say  Because Kamala Harris told me that we needed to riot and continue rioting after the election to see change.   I m just glad you aren t the one writing the law on what constitutes as inflammatory and inciteful rhetoric  Jesus Christ.  Bro   flip it around. If BLM said and did the same thing  I doubt you  39 d be on this sub saying that. I  39 m also glad rddit doesn  39 t get to write laws  lol.  I absolutely would  because those are pretty common phrases repeated across the political spectrum and in no way inciting violence. It would barely cross my mind if some BLM activist said  we re coming for x  or about fighting something because they do it all the damn time. Yet I ve never considered that level of rhetoric to be associated with the riots during the summer  so don t even go there and pretend you know what I would say.  Ok  that proves my fucking point. All I was saying what that the rhetoric was obviously inflammatory  and the other guy said it was fine and not a big deal. Glad we are on the same page  Huh  Why would that prove your point  I specifically said the type of rhetoric you mentioned is not inflammatory even if it was said by BLM.  BLM did billions in damage and destroyed countless livelihoods  So would you or would you not say BLM used inflammatory rhetoric  That was the original point I was making.  Are you insane. You sound like a raving Liberal who uses the term Hate Speech...when the ACLU even says it doesn  39 t exist and has no Constitutionality.  Who the hell is downvoting this  It s simple truth  Ok  now do Democrats and the BLM riots. You know the difference  Everyone  including Trump  denounced it and told them to go home within the hour. What did the democrats do  That s right.   quot These bastards are going around telling the truth  and now people are angry. Stop this violent rhetoric at once  quot   It  39 s like when Adam Schiff came out with his own version of what the Ukraine call said...and everyone just ate it up. Barf.  This is what I ve noticed a ton of politics has been recently. Most of the conversations I see aren t actually about what was said  but what people think your intentions are.  intresting as pompeo is supposed to be a deep state guy  How is Pompeo avoiding negative press  Or am I just not seeing it   This is so true. I see so many conservatives acting like if they side with the media and against trump  all of a sudden the media will  quot like quot  them. In reality they  39 ll continue to smear you and you  39 ve gained nothing while subsequently alienating the vast majority of trump supporters who still believe in the president and consider stochastic terrorism to be thought crime bullshit only ever applied in one direction.  Pompeo   quot we  39 re planning on a peaceful transition into a 2nd Trump term quot   That was weeks ago  what about it   Are you joking  Your positing this like he just stated it  when he stated this weeks ago. Things have clearly changed  according to who  your blogs   The President of the United States. Did you watch his Twitter video  Oh wait...  lol  Go ahead and think about two facts before sucking down more of that koolaid   Trump stood up for the ppl  the most important thing  but the people  establishment GOP  didn  39 t back him up against the left. his presidency is over and the problem is bigger than we all thought   removed   its good in the sense that conservatives  39  eyes have now been opened. i think Trump just accelerated the rabidness and attack from the left. another GOP McCain or Bush type would  39 ve just slowed the onset of this war from the left for a few yrs or a decade.   we already are winning this. everything Trump has been saying for the last 4 years is true and it  39 s all going to play out  with proof  in front of the American public with the whole world watching. and it  39 s going to be glorious. none of what you  39 ve just seen matters. it  39 s a farce. a show. a literal coup. and Trump let them do all of this. he gave them exactly as much rope as they wanted  and they came back every day hungry for more.  i hope you  39 re right but it sure as shit doesn  39 t feel like we  39 re winning lol. it feels like we  39 re getting stabbed in the front and back. and it  39 s so toxic right now to be a conservative  whether you  39 re silent or vocal. but we gotta keep the fight up even on social media bc otherwise the left wins and the next generations don  39 t know any better   removed   good advice.  I  39 m really surprised Pompeo is defending Trump at this point  not because I don  39 t think Trump needs defending  but because Pompeo always struck me as Establishment  given his political roots and bosses in the past.  Pompeo has been a solid Trump loyalist.  He s not. He s been rock solid this whole time. Imagine the truth he sees being the scenes.

Do you think the song  Fortunate Son  has a special meaning for the Biden s   Wow  I definitely feel the unity  s  Then why are Hillary and Bill and Hunter still not in jail...     I m confused. I feel like I m seeing  a href   r politics  r politics  a  articles being posted in this sub. Then they re awarded and applauded  What gives   If you see an award  95  of the time  it is from leftists trying to draw attention to their propaganda.  Especially if it is one of those weird emojis.  Lmao. Like the fucking mask one  I remember when it was verboten to even mention charging Hilary for her violations of Federal Law.    Pretty ironic for a man literally surrounded by scandals and allegations who is completely protected by the media and fellow corrupt authoritarian politicians.  Unless  of course  you re a Dem.  Then  Justice be damned  Shut up  man  Let  39 s see how this one ages   unless there is a  D  next to your name.  That just tastes of sweet sweet iron  some might call it a bit irony.   quot Unity quot   Trumps leaving office and still living in these guys heads. I think a fair amount of people on the left are gonna regret Trump not winning because he won  39 t be in office to bitch about him all day and night. Though I  39 m not expecting the coverage of Trump to go away lol.  The left is its own worst enemy  and has NO problem eating its own. As soon as Biden takes office  Democrats will start bitching about him  too. Just wait.  Pot meet kettle  And yet you and Hillary are still walking around free  And yet here I sit still waiting for the crooked elitist in the Democrat party  Hillary Clinton  to pay for their crimes.  At least our vote kept her out of the oval office.  He is a fucking liar and hypocrite.  Can I ask you a question s  without getting into an argument with the whole fucking internet  I  39 ve been curious about this for a few months.   It means you re sitting on the sidelines  wondering why the fuck we decided to have a winner takes all system. 1  of the vote should be 1  of the representation in government. Instead  half the country feels like it s losing every election  How odd of you to say that  big guy.  Holy shit how far up his own ass is he when he says this crap.  HAHAHHA now THAT is rich   Omg thats hilarious  One word   strong HUNTER.  strong   this guy hahaha  That  39 s fucking rich.  Trump isn t above the law  but Democrats like creepy Joe sure are   That s rich coming from you.  Does he not realise that 70  of this is big teck being anti conservatives. The other 30  is a message to Biden and the dems saying  quot do what we want you to do or your next quot .  Says the head of the Biden crime family  Good  He  39 s gonna do something about Amazon  Facebook  Twitter  Google  and Apple  thank God   Do not know that  but sure hell protected those thugs you took your knee. You dumb stupid weak sleepy corrupted shitty idiot.  Biden and the Democratic leadership are bullies. They resent Trump because he out played them for four years. Now they have power. They are going to use any and every method to punish Trump and Trump supporters. They will use big tech to silence anything that disagrees with their agenda. They will use the media to paint their cause as just while they put a knee on the neck of anyone who gets in their way. Biden has always been a bully. Look at the comments he has made even as his mind fades. Look at Nancy. As people were going hungry  she ate her fancy ice cream and held up relief for political reasons. While many common people have been fooled by the Democratic leadership  the Democratic Party is run by and ruled by evil.  It s like I woke up in opposite land  That s rich coming from him  Really  because it sure works out for your corrupt crime family and your crack addled degenerate child                                                                You re the one in power Biden  Lmfao yeah right  What a bunch of hypocrites

They re planning a lot more than cancel culture.   Re education or purging.  Oh the horror. Not that  I m pretty positive a lot of these people arnt cancelling Trump because they want to but because they feel like they have to or they ll be cancelled by cancel culture  I ve been wondering this myself. Do they really think this is good for their companies long term  Or are they just pandering for easy positive  and short term  headlines   2nd one  All it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.  Oh  that will change everything.  Screw the pga who gives a shit what they have to say

Orwellian doublespeak  Communism started with cleansing of those who got in the way  And continued with killing off the useful idiots  looking at you lefties.  The correct term in this case is Communism.   I  39 ve said it before   American kids these days ain  39 t tough enough for Communism.  I mean  they sure ain  39 t Russian.

A bunch of cave dwelling folks with ak 47  39 s and some explosive devices fought back and stalemated our military and they beat the Russians outright.

You don  39 t want to to be accused of looking at or distributing  child pornogrpahy. Joe Biden is covering for his criminal son  it makes you wonder the crimes the Joe himself has comitted.

Biden should be in jail  100  lie on both counts  and he knows it because he directly benefits from it.

Screw your sense of justice.  Either he  39 s a stupid  corrupt piece of shit... or an arrogant  corrupt piece of shit.  That s what the 2nd will be when only the very wealthy can afford the licenses and taxes for guns  mags  carry permits  and good lawyers if they ever have to use their gun.

t3_kug3x6,Congressman Cohen to introduce resolution to abolish the Electoral College,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kug3x6/congressman_cohen_to_introduce_resolution_to/,It  39 s going to take an amendment to the constitution to abolish the electoral college.  The democrats don  39 t care they will write legislation and then try to fight it through court. All the while using the MSM to drum up support.  It s like you ve seen them do this before...who knew   While big tech censors dissenting voices.  Are they hoping to run their lawyers ragged  Everything being proposed right now is unconstitutional and is going to get fought in the courts.   They don  39 t care. They have full control over congress and the executive branch. They have also been talking on and off about packing the supreme court. They are on a pretty large power trip and I just don  39 t think they care about what is legal under the constitution anymore. Plus they know the media will back them up 100  of the time  and with these crackdowns on free speech  they know the opposition in the media is continually being silenced so they wont have that to worry about as much as in the past.  They ll have to go through the Supreme Court to just pass a law  won t happen.  I don t think they are thinking that far ahead. Also I m not entirely sure they won t just ignore the constitution and when the Supreme Court tries to stop them  if the court actually acts  will just ignore pack the court.  All the Dems have to do is threaten to pack the Court and it will roll over and let them do whatever they want  just like it did when Roosevelt threatened to do so.  It  39 s funny because Biden was quoted  before this current run  that packing the court is crazy  ridiculous  and should never be done.  Save those videos to your personal drives.  Why  So we can watch them from our bug out locations later   The MSN is going to whitewash this story.  I know.  I m just making the point of no one cares but us what politicians have said.  Yeah  because the courts were concerned about upholding election integrity... Wait  no they weren  39 t.  This is one of those issues the courts will either take up or the people will lose confidence in the system. The electoral college is very specifically spelled out in the constitution  and ignoring the system of checks and balances prescribed in the constitution means betraying your oath of office. Congressman Cohen here is attempting to betray his oath of office.  Does anyone have confidence in the system right now   I don  39 t get it  why would anyone believe the system works anymore.  Because daddy Zuckerberg tells me to  BINGO.  We were never truly in control of the situation were we  They played us all like fucking fiddles and we blindly marched to their tune right over the cliff and into the trap that was the capitol storming didn t we   They control congress  they control the executive  they control the courts  proven by how many election cases were thrown out explicitly because the court just didn  39 t want to examine the case   and they are going to force control of the supreme court. They control a vast majority of state and local political offices and the nation  39 s entire beurocratic system is full of anti conservative Dems  down to the clerk signing drivers license applications. They control education and academia  and they control the media. All opposition is silenced or actively being purged  calls for political genocide are growing. If you think they  39 re going to stop at  quot unconstitutional quot  then you  39 re in for a very rude awakening when they start really pushing everything they want through with no opposition. Burying your head in the sand or trying to pretend like you  39 re one of the good ones isn  39 t going to save you.  They  39 re hoping to pay enormous legal fees to litigate nonsense  so that these politico law firms can then donate the money back to them.   It  39 s a money laundering scheme.    Trump had 100 000 people at his rallys in Pennsylvania  in Arizona and in Georgia  there was no way he was going to lose those states  and there  39 s no way the Dems could cheat... oh wait.  They need to win qualified majority as well. But they already have MSM support for that.  No it won t  the constitution is only worth what people decide it s worth.  We could have presidents last for life if nobody was capable of enforcing otherwise.  It will happen...  Since when have democrats cared about the Constitution   Why waste time  Let s just go full socialist in the first 30 days  Faster than that apparently  we are only on day  10   Might as well  not sure if you have seen it but they have already put up a large list of gun control bills as well.  Wow  you  39 re right.  H.R. 127  Here is the list so far that I can come up with   If they do away with the electoral college  add more states  or stack the courts  I would wholeheartedly support the formation of the United Conservative States of America.  I think we all will. But we get to take the name United States of America. They are something else now.  It  39 s a stupid fucking idea  but at least this is the proper way to attempt it.    Ratification isn t necessary anymore if the courts don t have the guts to take cases.  Also there would have to be someone to challenge it.  Unless they successfully keep conservatives divided and get large majorities in Congress 2022.   removed    removed    removed    removed   Lmao. Never will there be a republican president again.  Defeatist attitude  never give up.  Especially when it s about liberty  They literally just stole two elections back to back and the only people who cared enough to show up were labeled terrorists and denounced by both parties and the media.  NO REPUBLICAN WILL EVER WIN AGAIN is a statement of fact.  Go jerk off to your Trump shrine while the rest of us continue to fight  Enjoy your  quot voting quot  while they rig the election.  lol  Are you minding me  If that was to happen look who controls a mass majority of the states.. it s cities with deep blue ties  So far they  39 ve introduced gun restrictions to take away 2nd Amendment rights  now the abolition of the Electoral College. Can there be any doubt they are going to try to do all those things Trump  et al warned us about  Too bad so many didn  39 t listen  now we all pay the price.  That check isn  39 t going to be handed over I don  39 t think  I could be wrong though  seems like there are still a lot of conservatives in complete denial. They think the GOP will come riding in and save us all  we are such fools.  Yeah the states won  39 t put up with that shit  This is how you will turn a democracy into a dictatorship  with a puppet leader.  Didn  39 t the SCOTUS just rule that Texas was not able to tell other states how to run their election processes....essentially   layman  39 s terms....     So  how would getting rid of the electoral college be any different....    Scroll through my comments  I have been saying this for months.  BE VERY AFRAID OF WHAT IS COMING  A DICTATORSHIP     The US is now a one party country  in 4 years will be a Socialist country and we got a chance to watch it  front row   SC will be flooded and Puerto Rico will be a state.  Done and done   Oh yeah  the US will also lose its status as the world  39 s reserve currency.  So that  39 s it  California and NYC are going to decide who wins the election from now on  Might as well tell the other States no not bother voting.  Here we go  The fall of the Republic is near  That is a bit above the paygrade of a resolution  kind of requires a constitutional amendment.  How to impressively fail.  Why bother  they found a way to steal the last election so just keep doing that and let the illusion that votes matter keep everyone quiet.  Why not establishing monarchy  while we at it   No need. With new rules on counties doing free unchecked unrequested mailing of ballots  there were counties where 99  votes were sent by mails  Republicans will never win POTUS  Senate or Congress.  We need to impeach joe manchin now and get a reliable republican. What are you doing west virginia

t3_kvimmy,Hockey analyst fired for saying Not even any woman here to disrupt your concentration when discussing the NHLs bubble,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvimmy/hockey_analyst_fired_for_saying_not_even_any/,Most reasonable women would roll their eyes and laugh at this. It s just stupid and silly   not a brutal attack on all women. The only women with a thin skin are the ones who have subscribed to the 47th wave of feminism where women don t even exist anymore.  AKA the ones that can  39 t distract a man. Feminazis are always female incels.  This wasn t the reason as for why he was fired. To put it lightly  Milbury is a blockhead. A lot of people hate him because he crosses the line quite frequently with his very hot takes. If anyone is wondering who this guy actually is  he played for the Bruins and went into the stands and beat someone with their own shoe.  We should start a list.  Any woman with half a brain would laugh at this. They know they distract men  and most of them enjoy doing it.  It  39 s only insulting to women that can  39 t get a man  39 s attention. Make no mistake  they  39 re the ones  quot outraged. quot   I wish they fired him over being a shit commentator instead of empty virtue signaling. At least he is gone.  He would be hired elsewhere if we had a competition of ideas. Too bad all the good ideas are censored.  Big fucking deal. Mike milbury is kind of a dink   but now that I think about it  I enjoy his analysis.
t3_kupkwt,Russian Dissident Alexey Navalny Decries Twitter Censorship Of Trump Compares To Kremlin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kupkwt/russian_dissident_alexey_navalny_decries_twitter/,Don t be fooled by this guy. He s the male version of AOC in Russia  Putin still shouldn t have tried to kill him  If that s actually true then I do agree with that. I m just not convinced it is true. Putin has degrees of corruption just like any other politician or political leader  but I don t believe certain things the media says about him  with good reason  Putin probably has an actual degree of corruption considering he was a kgb spy.  Okay  and there were presidents who worked for the CIA. All politicians are corrupt but remember why MSM keeps demonizing Putin like they do Trump  I  39 m not arguing for nor against Alexey but comparing him to AOC is wildly inaccurate. Both he and Putin fall outside of the American left right paradigm.

t3_kufbgj,Lead singer Tommy Vext from band Bad Wolves has been forced out over his conservative political beliefs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kufbgj/lead_singer_tommy_vext_from_band_bad_wolves_has/,Their biggest hit is a cover song.  So the rest of the band must not have been creative powerhouses.  They  quot updated quot  the lyrics for Zombie and I was just not a fan  the Cranberries version is 100 times better.  To be fair  I do believe Dolores was supposed to do the vocals but she died right before they were going to record so the guy doing the vocals was a last minute thing and meant as a tribute to her.  It wasn  39 t an awful cover  but I do think with the updated lyrics the song lost its power. It went from being about the Troubles  or I guess end of the Troubles to being just about modern warfare  and I didn  39 t think it resonated the same way. And you are spot on with Dolores  39  vocals for the song are just unbeatable.  The thing with Zombie is that it s a protest song about a very specific terrorist bombing during a very specific time by a very specific group that s no longer relevant  so re releasing it 25 years later and NOT changing the lyrics really wouldn t make any logical sense. While I wish they just left it alone  it is her song after all so if anyone has a right to change the lyrics it would be her  and who knows what the updated version would have been like had she not passed. Now with her passing the band was in a spot where either they have to scrap the project altogether or release it not just with different lyrics but with completely different vocals. Must have been a pretty tough spot.  You re entirely correct that the Bad Wolves version was basically going to be a new one including the original lead vocalist  Dolores  from the first song. She did die. I believe all or most of the money generated from the new cover was donated to some charity as requested by Dolores s family  em or  em  it was given to her family.  And I still prefer the original.  A singer can always find a band... Back to the garage boys  your 15 minutes is up.  Leftism is a cancerous cult.  Damn it I really liked that band. I m sure they will go to shit now like every other band that breaks up.  David Draiman did well with Device.  Hopefully Vext too.  Disturbed didn  39 t break up though  that was just a side project.  They were on  hiatus  for YEARS.  That s a shame  he had a nice voice. Saw them live a few times as openers for FFDP.  Where is Biden and all his unity and healing talk now   He is counting his 10   We are being pushed to create a conservative only society.  They re coming for all of us.  You could say he was ...... a wolf in sheep s clothing.  Before everyone grabs their pitchforks  it is quite possible he quit because he was sick of them and their politics  not the other way around like most are currently assuming. It doesn t seem to really say one way or the other.  He stated as such   I thought that all of them are conservatives  Also  didn t the former lead singer  guy who was just let go  from Bad Wolves sing a few songs for FFDP when their lead singer took time off   Never heard of them.

Men like Randall Lane may be abhorrent  inconvenient  and unfit to be American but the ultimately unfortunate truth is they are far from alone.

Can confirm police violence is only accepted and absolutely necessary when dealing with any Conservative.  Leftists stand so frivolously against the death of a Capitol officer  which is sad and my deepest sympathies go to the family  but did they forget their objective for the summer was to defund  belittle and bring harm to police  They weren t outraged at that. If they weren t turning a blind eye  they were egging it on. Party of incognizant hypocrites.  They didn  39 t give a shit about dead cops until it  39 s politically convenient  it  39 s sickening.  Your mistake is pretending that they have morals or values beyond concentrating political power for themselves.  My city had two officers shot during the riots and it  39 s sub was clearly cheering about it.  This cop is just a political prop to them. They didn  39 t suddenly start caring about police right now. This is the democrats trying to get away with murder. Actually  the murder of Ashli Babbit.  It was only a matter of time.

Drives to the next house   I can just see that being a Family Guy cutaway  This is some fifty shades of grey stuff lmao  I was hoping it would be the Tom Hanks in the grocery store pasta.  Too bad he couldn t have enlisted the help of Jehovah s Witnesses   they are professional door knockers    My life would be complete.  Yeah so Pence hates  him btw  Has that always been true or just since the 6th   Apparently just since the sixth. Imagine sucking up like an industrial grade vacuum cleaner  and you still get tossed under the bus.  I  39 d say for a while now. Pence didn  39 t support him in the primaries  and in 2016 tried to replace trump shortly after the access hollywood tapes got released. He is also party responsible for flynn  39 s ouster and the extradition of Julian Assange.  Something that  39 s been slowly building I think.  Always  I would pay for this to happen to me.  Tbh I wouldn  39 t mind it  Pence   quot get in loser  we  39 re going conspiracy spreadin  quot   It wont be Pence driving...   Yo I would love that  I  39 m guessing he  39 ll realize there  39 s a whole dedicated press conference room in the WH  with reporters on standby. He  39 ll just write tweets on paper and call hasty press conferences to read them to whoever is there.  I bet they would just ignore him  honestly. It took them 4 years but they  em finally  em  realized that if they ignore him he has no power.  I was disappointed to hear he  39 d been banned from Twitter  but a friend turned me on to a new guy by the name of Ronaldo Trumpo who seems to agree with the President on almost everything.  Oh what a coincidence. I came across this fella on Twitter  Ronaldinio Trumpinio. He also agrees 100  with Mr Trump s ideas.  also  John Barron also seems to be in alignment.  I gotta go look that guy up   Huh  he sounds like Ronald Reagan fused with Trump  This is so good lol  If only he had a press room in the house he lives in with 24 7 access to major news networks.  and you know that at least that Acosta cnn guy will be there.  bring popcorn.  While I appreciate the satire  let  39 s not forget that inside his house is a press room and a podium. He can still address the nation the way presidents before him did for decades.  You can  39 t not love this.  I shared it on Facebook because it made me chuckle and all I got was an angry react from a friend who loves Trump.  I mean that would be cool though to see the president at your front door. I  39 ve never meet a president before.  I have been within 20 feet of Trump at rallies before he was president  and then was about 100 ft from him at a rally as president. Pretty cool   Literally had lunch with him in Palm Beach at a sales motivation event with Tony Robbins. He was the same man as he is now. He told stories and jokes. It was a great experience.  Nice  I want to just have a lunch or something with someone like that one day. Not talk shop or anything  just  quot Oh  this meal is great. Reminds me of that time I was in Charleston. You ever been there  quot  and let him just carry on about whatever.  Damn that s pretty cool  my parents actually met Donald Trump about 15 years ago at a fundraiser in our small town he did  they still have a picture of them standing next to Donald trump and it is really cool to think about  So many people downvoting so hard lol  It  39 s 85  upvoted  bro.  At the time of my comment every comment was negative.  Every comment i put on here  even if it  39 s not political like this one  starts out downvoted.

It s crazy today my pro trump posts are getting crazy upvotes  I usually get into the negatives.  I don  39 t understand why anyone not able to comment is able to vote.

Trump could literally end world hunger and people would still hate him   Donald Trump puts millions of food service workers out of jobs    He only did it to try and get people s votes   It  39 s true  I did. I shamelessly used people  39 s emotions to farm karma.  I definitely don  39 t like him but I would give respect where it  39 s due.  He ended war basically in an entire region of the world... no credit given  i mentioned this to my left facebook friends  i was swamped with replies downplaying this and really how unimportant it was.  guess i need to watch cnn to for better opinions.

Chances are it s being upvoted by people from  a href   r politics  r politics  a  but it seems there s a decent few people here who can take a joke.  Some conservatives. Some  Politicians are going to have to take note. Maybe this will create a resurgence of campaigning by train. That would be a sight to see.  Everyone in the GOP probably sighing a breath of relief seeing that  He didn t shout it  he declared it.

Eff those a holes.  When should I be expecting him  I ll join.  The fact that Twitter banned him for spewing nonsense is hypocritical when that  39 s what half the people on that accursed site do  and they get away with it just fine...  Islamic terrorists  leftarded anarchists  and demented blood cult despots calling for the eradication of the Jews are still on Twitter.   The level of commitment.

t3_kuix5l,Arnold Schwarzenegger likens Capitol riot to Nazi attack on Jews,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuix5l/arnold_schwarzenegger_likens_capitol_riot_to_nazi/,The left has been waiting for this four years  Of course they re going to run with it. They are going to fit four years of their anger into a couple weeks.  Ain  39 t that the truth. I  39 m thinking they may have jumped the gun though. After the dust settles  in the average American  39 s mind  this is not going to play into the  quot WORST THING IN THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLIC quot  drivel they  39 re spouting. And if it does we  39 re really in trouble. But I  39 m hopeful this will be another nail in the coffin of media  social and legacy  credibility.  Oh  you mean like the rioters in Kenosha Who burn down buildings and  killed people  Or like the residence of Chaz   ...or white antifa rioters who burned down  30 million federal project homes which house poor black people in Minneapolis  Or white liberals burning small businesses owned by Indians  Asians  Blacks  and Latinos and justifying it because  quot they have insurance quot    Officer David Dorn  rest in peace officer  was killed by a black man looting his friends store.  Good call. I am so out of it today  It s fine. I am too  Doesn t fit the narrative  sorry  Or like the liberal rioters who did the exact same thing during the Kavanaugh confirmation  except that they were welcomed in and allowed to disrupt the proceedings    Let  39 s imagine how the 2020 summer of riots could of been different if there was this type of condemnation.  I didnt know he was a propagandist too  I thought the guy who compared the capital riot to 911 was retarded.   It s not that they re out of depth. It s that they re reading a script. One cannot be so shallow and blind.  I m not so sure...   removed   Same  Exactly this. I don t support what the rioters did  but you re right in the fact that there has been a massive overreaction to what occurred that is doing further damage and driving more people to specific sides  if you will.  The worst part is they make it even more redicuolous each time they talk about. They are like dads talking about the fish they caught 10 years ago.  Look  it was  em this  em  big  I have a right to be proud of it   What s even worse than  em that  em  is this is being labeled as  brave  by mainstream media news publications online. The lack of awareness is baffling.  The roids  quot pumped him up quot  but killed the brain cells. smh   removed   If anything Arnold  this was a Reichstag Fire for the Democrats to erase conservative voices.  Exacto mundo. Only what took Nazis 5 years from Reichstag Fire to Kristallnacht.  When the overreaction is worse than the action.  And has lasted like ten times as long  Except that the only thing that parallels nazism is the democrat response to the occupation of the capitol building.  Suddenly lawmakers are Jews   Godwin  39 s Law is permeating every facet of life for the worse.  Sounds like something a Nazi would say. I  39 m off to report you to the wrong think police.  Arnold your looking like a Steven Seagal...  This shit is out of control. These events are not even in the same universe with respect to comparing to one another  and it degrades the horrors of what happened to Jews under Nazi oppression.  No one ever accused this guy of being smart.  Had child with his maid. Talks about  quot eating is not cheating quot . No different than Bill Clinton  aside from being not as smart.  Weird thing for an Austrian to say. Does go to show there may be a coordinated effort as Biden made similar Nazi references. Hard to tell because that  39 s been a common thing from Democrats for years.  talk about pissing on holocaust victims. what a shameful thing to say.  Is it just a coincidence he  39 s Austrian  or...   Totally the same thing. They took all the dems and threw them into camps where they starved them  stripped them naked  shot them  burned them and gassed them. It was strikingly similar.  Get back in the choppa Arnold.  Excellent use of projection lmao  Does the cia have you pushing too many pencils   Republicans are going to destroy their own party.  A true example of  quot those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it quot . These idiots feel like they are on the right side of history until they aren  39 t.  Truth is it  39 s exactly like hitler  39 s overtaking of a country they just think they are the Jews not the nazis.  How does he  em compare  em  these two events  Not even if you compare styles are they similar or mean the same thing  Windows were broken  that s it.   Coming from the man who allegedly had a collection of and enjoyed listening to Nazi marching anthems when he arrived in America.  This is the exact same reaction the nazis would have had for the Jews if they had revolted to build support for exterminating them  Arnold  39 s father was literally an SS officer.  It  39 s on record.  He lost all my respect.

t3_ku6v3s,Amazon Booting Parler Off Its Web Hosting Service,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku6v3s/amazon_booting_parler_off_its_web_hosting_service/,This is fucking insane   removed   Almost every app you use pays an AWS subscription including Reddit  Sure  doesn t mean I can t try to limit what I give them. Not getting my  13 a month anymore for prime  and everything that I can I will source elsewhere now. I spent   5k on Amazon.com last year  bet you that it s under a few hundred bucks or less this year.  So this is the prequel to 1984...  Amazon hosts 40  of cloud hosted websites on the internet. Seems extremely problematic that Amazon can simply pick and choose which sites they want shut down across almost half of the internet  True but one isn  39 t obligated to use the cloud. The cloud is a convenience. You are still empowered to purchase and host your own servers. Also there are several competitors within cloud  even outside the big names AWS  Azure  GCP.  Yes  if you have a few billion laying around  and time to build buildings  buy thousands of servers  and lay fiber  and program them.  Uh  you just rent rack space at somewhere like hurricane electric  buy some servers  switches and firewalls. A lot of companies could save money by running their own servers. AWS is great for startups but after a certain point it s cheaper to host it yourself. I don t know how many users parlor has but I doubt it would be more than 200k to move to a self hosted model  Tough on short notice.  Yeah  true. I was just pushing back on the uninformed post about cost.  It  39 s not near that complicated. I worked for a company that was dependant on AWS and we moved to our own Cloud which saved us a ton of money and gave us better control when issues came up.    No  more like 100k in hardware and a few k a month for rack space. Long term it  39 s actually cheaper than Amazon.  Google has spent billions in infrastructure  obviously a smaller operation would be cheaper.  Democracy dies in darkness   em  What I remember about the rise of the Empire is... is how quiet it was.   em   They don t like free speech  But Amazon does like slave labor  since they continue to sell products made by Chinese slaves in concentration camps.  They are also not exactly kind to their warehouse labor either in the states.  This is just bezos kissing the ring to continue anticompetitive practices.  Or conservatives  They didn t like free speech ever since they banned the sale of confederate flags on their site.  The response by the left to the Capitol is completely disproportionate. Parler literally didn  39 t even do anything. It has nothing to do with Trump.. This past week and next will be a defining moment in American history  assuming we actually still have honest historians in the future. Although based on how things currently are  I am not confident at all that history will be accurately written by most historians. We are already seeing tons of revisionist history and lies being spread around all the time  Facebook also deleted the WalkAway page.  This one is the most disturbing to me. Literally nothing to do with inciting violence. Was clearly just removed bc it goes directly against the Democrat positions  Parler is rapidly transforming into  quot The NAZI Network quot  in the fevered minds of many far leftists.  People used the excuse that parts of it were like a cesspool  and I guess no one has ever even seen twitter lol   removed   Just canceled Prime  it was the least I could do to say  thanks  for letting me know they have no morals or backbone.  They could be forcing us to wear shirts identifying us as right wingers and many here would continue to force us to  stick to our values   This is horrible for the AWS brand. No one is going to want to use AWS when they can and will shut off your site if you get  quot cancelled quot .  Wrong most the liberal idiots will think they are safe till it is there time.  The hypocrisy. One of their UK employees suffered a fatal heart attack whilst working   lay undiscovered for ages   but when he put the wrong item in a bin he was corrected immediately.  How big of an issue is this really  Assume that I know nothing about web hosting  why can t Parler just move to another service    strong TL DR   I don  39 t know how reliant Parler is upon AWS specific services  but this looks  strong   strong  em very  em   strong   strong grim for them as a company.  strong   They aren  39 t on their proprietary stuff. So they can move the ceo said they have talks on going we have a but of hope.  I  39 m not a Parler user  but I hope they can make that jump. Competition in the social media sector is sorely lacking  especially given the current climate. Facebook  Twitter  and Reddit need some healthy competition to remind them they can be replaced.  Thank you so much for the well informed answer and the time it took you explain all this   Glad it helped   because there are only so many cloud hosting services  and all of them are going to refuse to take Parler  39 s service. Microsoft  Google and Amazon are the big ones but even the smaller cloud hosting services rely on these giants as well  if they try to offer parler a safe harbor then they risk the same fate. Most of the internet runs on services provided by these companies  or is supported directly by these companies. Even if Parler hosts their own datacenter  their own physical building and bare metal computers  the tech giants could make their DNS servers not route to their website or route to a black hole although it would be a big move to do such a thing... i  39 m sure the tech giants have some clout over the root DNS servers too but anyway  their only option is try hosting their own physical location s  which is going to cost way more  and if any natural disaster or  quot Natural quot  disaster happens their probably done with.  The CEO basically said they are done if AWS drops them  Not true. Their latest statement is that they  39 ve built from bare metal so they  39 re not reliant on the AWS infrastructure. They believe they  39 ll be able to be back up within a week  What s aws   Amazon Web Services.  A cost effect way to  pay as you go  for web servers  databases and more.  Thanks for the info. I didn t realize they and other companies hosted services like that. I thought those companies had their own. But I can see that it s quite expensive. It sounds like a market that could be worth something if someone started their own data center. But I don t know the in and outs of that stuff. I m sure it s quite expensive.  This post will really be in the weeds  but I do this stuff for a living so I ll explain it a little further for anyone who is interested. There are really three ways to go about it   For your first example if someone made their own data center they would still have to follow their IP s TOS right  I can see that being in  violation  somehow and the company could be purged or stripped of their internet for whatever reason.   Ah  I remember when NN was being pushed hard on this site and every sub had something to say about it. Interesting to see the affects from the push. I could tell Reddit s over reach was too much when they did that and you could see their reach during 2016 for certain.   The internet of the 90s was great. You could setup your own website using a computer that sat under your desk. Do that today and your poor computer would be crushed by the sheer number of Chinese bots trying to hack your website.  Not in 24 hours.  They need a lot of infrastructure so they used Amazon s servers   I guess not realizing that Amazon would ever consider pulling the plug on them.  Google and Apple did the same.  They will be back in around a week.  This concerted attack on Parler makes me think Democrats plan on doing something this week and they need their corporate masters to keep us all from communicating.  Throwing Trump in jail   And then they will be DDoS  39 d.  I  39 m going to miss this sub when they ban it.  I have been an Amazon Prime member since the service began several years ago  but no more.  Bezos Amazon has crossed the line.  I am dropping my Amazon Prime membership and I will no longer buy from Amazon.  Several other businesses offer online shopping with free delivery and no membership fee.  Walmart and Homedepot even accept Paypal for payment.  I  39 m done with Amazon and will be finding an alternative e mail service to gmail.  Important  If you are iPhone the way you stop Apple from deleting Parler from you phone is   I m so confused. On what grounds are they doing this  What violations has Parler committed  Catered to a conservative crowd  Fuck off Amazon  They have to sue. It  39 s as simple as that. Companies can  39 t hide behind being independent. It  39 s obvious these tech companies are conspiring  and that  39 s illegal.  What happens when we find out the rioters were Apple and Google users as well   Oh  nothing   Gab has its own server so... also they are developing their own device  Clouthub  Yikes   This greatly concerns me professionally.  My organization is working on a large project that s hosted on AWS.  If they are willing to do this  I can easily see them shutting us down too. Definitely a hot topic for this week s project meeting.

It definitely sent a message  but the consequences on the whole of the right are much more drastic than the message sent.  The fools didn t realize only Democrats are allowed to do that.  143 people  no violence as per the article you cited.   removed   Look at the bills on gun control the house is already pushing.  Not good.  Well for one it would help if government wasn  39 t so partisan. The Democrat voters are bitter of the lack of bipartisanship during the Obama years. So that doesn  39 t help. Then the polarisation of current politics doesn  39 t help either.   Well government is partisan so we just have to deal with it.  What is your suggestions besides  quot cant we all just get along quot    Yiu really think the GOP wins a lot of elections when Texas eventually turns blue  Let  39 s face it  moving a bit further left may help draw in more voters.  Oh I dont think the GOP will win another significant election again ever  regardless of how much they compromise their principles to attract supposed moderates.  Now that the leftists control everything they are just going to make it even easier to commit fraud by removing any and all verification of voters.  This will be covered up by their surrogates in big tech and media who will spin it as some significant gain in voting rights.  The GOP is done.  How can the left even say what happened was a riot   Portland was  is  a riot.  It doesn  39 t excuse breaking windows to try to get in  or acting foolishly with going into the capital.  It just didn  39 t look like a riot to me.  And  yes  the left and the media will jump on anything if it  39 s against Trump.  I  39 ve never seen so much hatred for one man in my life time.  Persecution backed by government during a period of four years guaranteed.    x200B

Beyond that  numbers are as trustworthy as Kungflu stats.   quot I have evidence that will lead to the arrest of Hillary clinton quot   If they just link things to the riots it ll really turn people.  s  So he was doing his job and responding to a riot and now he s dead via suicide.

Gab is experiencing surge and twitter is allegedly losing users.  Twitter won  39 t let people delete their accounts apparently.  Glad I never created one  As of when  You can always deactivate it.  glad i was able to delete mine yesterday  why they wouldn  39 t allow   Probably to stop the mass exodus  which looks bad for them. Stock will dip. It shows how many were only there for conservatives. Might cause others to leave as well.   A large drop causes their stock to drop. When they sell ads they claim x number of users etc.   If your account is suspended  they literally will not let you delete your account.  Thats what I and others are saying  I think. People are trying to delete an unsuspended account and Twitter wont let them. After you send a request to delete  they suspend the account.  2050  just find ur own planet bro   em Then proceeds to blow up our planet  em   This is going to end poorly  For who  No one in the government is coming after Dorsey that piece of fuck.  For the country.  Silencing half the country by force isn t going to win anyone s opinion over  all you do is piss people off further.  There is no unity here  only division.  Take away peoples voice and you only increase the chance for physical violence.    Yes it will the left is cheering what is going on  I doubt it. The only reason 2020 was a  quot crazy quot  year was because or corona. 2021 will be more of the same.  Parler has an excellent case for antitrust.  Pretty sketchy Apple and google ban them within hours of Twitter banning Trump...  That  39 s called a cartel. Big tech is a cartel.  It  39 s what we call collusion  which is definitely illegal.  Like it ever get through the court system.  The courts will just weasel their way out of this citing some technical impropriety.  If only conservatives could appoint more judges...  Perhaps not but the merits are good   deleted   Maybe they can crowdfund. Although realistically sites like GoFundMe would probably take them down.  Parler functions also in Europe. They could make a complaint to the EU Commission that would gladly use some hammer of justice to get some rightness to the world.  EU definitely isn  39 t an ally to conservatives. But I agree if they have a beef with the tech companies  it might be an avenue to get retribution when obvious collusion manipulation is at play.   removed   Actually big companies very often do make complaints to EU. Just  a href  https   www.wsj.com articles slack files eu antitrust complaint against microsoft 11595423056   7E text The 20complaint 2C 20filed 20Wednesday 20to widely 20used 20Office 20productivity 20suite.  rel  nofollow  last July Slack left anti competition complaint  a  against Microsoft to EU authorities. It is completely valid thing to do  especially when the media and corporations claim that they are just acting as corporations   business as normal. If it is business as normal  then filing anti competition complaint in foreign court is also business as normal.  How so   If it makes you feel any better  everyone still hates Dorsey.   For the left. They went too far  They always do. That s why I m not as worried as some. They always push too far and voters put them back in their place.  I don t appreciate being called dense. Do I think voter fraud cost Trump the election  Absolutely. Do I think Democrats will get away with that in every state in a non Presidential election year  2022   Absolutely not. 2022 is going to be 2010 on steroids.  Jack is a billionaire psychopath. The only way this would end poorly for him is if all conservatives boycott twitter and more importantly  Cash App and square. Cash app and square is where he made his billions. If every conservative small business owner and consumer refuses to ever use square to purchase or sell stuff he would make a tearful apology.  Tom would never do this to his. He just wanted to be our friend. But seriously social media was a mistake.  Never felt bad about deleting him until this comment.  Tom was a good guy.  I sense this is going to cause a lot more anger in the country.  I too sense a disturbance in the force. I pray there s no more violence. I also fail to see how this doesn t embolden the die hard Trumpers who already see everyone is out to get him. Big tech is just confirming many suspicions of freedom loss and encroaching communism  You  39 re more admirable than me. I don  39 t see a solution that doesn  39 t involve protest. The big tech companies will assist one another to avoid competition arising.  Well  if we actually had a free market  maybe. We don  39 t  not with big tech at least  its all cronyism. But I agree.  I guess that  39 s the irony. For the market to be free  it needs to be protected from monopolies and powers like these. But the law that protects us doesn  39 t mean anything because the incoming administration is on the same team as these massive corporations.  You  39 re missing the big picture. This is deliberate  they  39 re trying to piss people off to cause further division and violence.   That s not surprising. More division causes more unrest  the perfect environment for the government to step in and  save the day  aka goodbye freedoms  Good. People should be angry. The public forum becoming an echo chamber isn  39 t good for anyone.  This is a worldly concern. All the french politicians  tweeted xd  about it  What   What did they say   These tech dweebs think they  39 re untouchable.  They are untouchable. Every progressive on the internet is applauding this move and justifying it as an exercise of corporate free speech.  They are untouchable.  If a Trump administration couldn t stop their monopolies  do you honestly think a pro big tech Biden administration will    Trump didn  39 t even try until like 4 months before he had to leave office.    Dave Rubin  Woah. That is just kind of evil. I could understand if Jack wanted to comment on this by saying something about how getting rid of Parler helps to get rid of hate speech and prevent future attacks on the country  and continue to push their narrative. Instead he puts out a tweet with a heart and the image of the top charts and parler no longer there. Parler was trending number one on the charts and was a threat to Twitter  now it no longer is because apple and google got rid of it. With the context of this tweet  it really shows that Twitter was more focused on keeping their monopoly instead of helping to fight off hate speech.  Jack is a fuckin piece of shit. Plain and simple.  What a complete dick.  This is awful. If you check the popular page on reddit  all you  39 ll see is every sub supporting this guy  and other companies  censoring conservatives. Pathetic.  Popular page is usually toxic filth. The past few days its been nuclear waste level of crap.  Leaving Twitter and selling my stock.  I just barely got into trading  I  39 ve gotta figure out how shorts work by 4am    WeBull   gt  Sign Up   gt  Deposit money   gt   quot Options quot    gt  Buy  quot Put quot   That plunge was beautiful   Twitter is going to destroy itself and I could give a shit less. Do they really think advertisers are paying to have their products marketed to the Antifa BLM crowd  No. They aren t paying big money to market to people who can t afford to buy their shit. Eventually  they ll chase off most of the productive members of society and be left with a bunch of people who are unemployed  drowning under student loan debt that landed them nothing more than a job at Chipotle  have severe mental health addiction issues  etc. Those people don t have money to spend on the bullshit that gets marketed towards people on social media. Twitter s main product  advertising  will plummet in value. It s gonna be hard making that 100k bribe look like a sale of a legitimate advertising space when their ad space isn t valued at nearly that much anymore.   I think you underestimate how many affluent people are currently on the brainwashed spell of wokeshevism.  Yeah but those people aren t spending money on the cheap shit being advertised to Twitters target demographic. If I m reaching out for Twitter to advertise me  I m selling cheap consumerist bullshit  not the stuff that rich people buy. There s a reason a lot of people have never even heard of some high end brands. Those brands don t need to advertise because the people who want that shit know it exists because of its reputation as a product  not some marketing gimmick.  Saw Jack on joe rogans podcast and weasel is such a good explanation.  Was great to see tim pool call him out on everything he said but he  39 s such a slimy fuck he kept dancing around them.  I never knew I could hate a person as much as I hate Jack Dorsey.  I see he  39 s too ashamed to have that peach fuzz he calls a beard in his profile picture.  Woke Rasputin and Android Zuck v. 2.0   deleted   I respect your point of view but I feel it is mistaken  AWS got big because of government contracts. This will only lead to more division and more echo chambers. This will push everyone into bubbles which will overtime make Americans more and more disconnected from one another. People currently are warming up to the idea of a divorce  which is terrifying to me  and we aren  39 t even at the point where people can  39 t communicate with each other yet. Once one side can  39 t see what the other side is actually saying all they will have is even more straw mans and misconceptions about one another. The government is fully controlled by Democrats at the moment so good luck hoping their opposition get a say in anything.  Everyone needs to leave twitter now. I know Parler and Gab are struggling at the moment  but one or both or something else will break through. It is going to be a mess for awhile. Hopefully this sub hangs on.  He only owns like 2  of Twitter. We are going after the wrong person.  Where is his real net worth   Square    deleted   Bruh...Dave Rubin isn t the subject of this post. He s replying to scumbag Jack.  Oh nvm then I don t understand anything about Twitter  Yay the only post I can comment on without a  flaired user  attached to it  It s hilarious to read the other post and comments about censorship when you guys do the same fucking thing. Whiny bitches  Something something private platform.  But my freedom of speech   Republicans are more worried about likes and followers rather than an attempted coup on the country. Treasonous bitches. You guys ask immigrants to speak the language and assimilate but yet I don t hear a word when you have a white supremacy bitch walking around inside the capital with a rebel flag.

I absolutely blame obama and his rhetoric for making it fashionable to use racism as a crutch for something you don  39 t like and in politicians case anything you want to get done.  That  39 s racist.  lol wut      I can t say I m surprised  but the way these Dems have turned this into a race issue is just appalling  Not everything has to do with race  Stop pulling that card    Chose their whiteness over democracy  says the woman who is choosing division over unity and politics over helping those devastated by the shutdowns.  Democrat politicians are so disgusting. They make everything they can about race. Terrible people who never should have power over anyone.   strong Disenfranchise  strong  is the word of the month.  People saw whistleblowers complaints  under table suitcases of ballots  counted without poll watchers  we saw 4 30am 140k votes for  quot D quot . No ne bothered to investigate and then courts dismissed complaints as  quot no standing quot . People want fair elections  where integrity concerns are investigated  not swept under the rug.  Oh god this fucking hag is just asking them to do it again  I love how Skeletor thinks  now that Demonrats have usurped our democratic process  she has the right to flout her   39 morality  39  in our faces.

It was a DEBATE steven  maniacal laugh   Because he spent several decades of his life actively renouncing and apologizing for his past in the KKK  and spent much of his tenure as a politician voting for and supporting policies that would positively affect black people.  Yes  Democrats are very forgiving of Democrats.  Ted Kennedy murdered a woman and they forgave him before she was even buried.  You  39 re absolutely right. How could I have been so blind.   I think it takes a bit more than an apology for being a recruiter for a terrorist group that raped  tortured  and murdered black people for over a century.   In 1964  Byrd led a filibuster against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He also opposed the Voting Rights Act of 1965  as well as most of the anti poverty programs of President Lyndon Johnson s Great Society initiative.   In fairness the Johnson Great Society initiative is a collection of some of the worst legislation our country has ever had introduced.    But apparently I learned that the NAACP apparently didn t support the 1964 and 1965 civil rights acts.  The thought is more a critique of the Democrats  39  hypocrisy in canceling anyone and everyone on the right who said the tiniest thing they don  39 t like 30  years ago  but they can forgive their own people who change  no big deal.

Nothing the Democrats did or want to do positively affects black people or any other type of people  except politicians and insiders .  And the KKK was founded and run by Democrats.  Byrd actually used his kkk connections to jumpstart his political career as a Democrat  and while making ritual denunciations for the wider audience  never changed his voter base.  Because it wasn  39 t Donald Trump that eulogized a klan member....  And said if  desegregation happens we are all going to be living in a jungle.  de  Oops yes you are correct. Desegregation. Thanks for catching that   lmao they ve already moved to calling other republicans  literally Hitler  and Trump isn t even out of office yet.  He keeps calling people nazis. Hey joe  this ain t it.  Unity sup TM  sup   That is actually seriously super insulting and offensive to the Holocaust survivors that are still out there. Joseph Goebbels was a sick  evil son of a bitch who was partly responsible for the murder of millions of  innocent loved ones.   They have run out of things to compare to. Once it got worse than  literally worse than hitler satan  there s nowhere else to go really. It s sad how much they hate. Trump Derangement Syndrome is a real thing.  Yep exactly. It  39 s a horrible and insulting comparison.  If it  39 s a big lie  conduct an investigation. Let  39 s do a thorough audit. Remove any doubt.  This.

Oh how our dystopian novelists of the past  Huxley  Orwell  Rand  etc. got it all too eerily correct...  That s a crazy interesting comment to put into perspective. I m willing to bet we ll be the closest to an authoritarian nightmare as you can possibly get. America isn t built for the upcoming factions...  Betting that things will be worse seems to be where the smart money is at the moment.   Excess deaths have been historically normal since July or so.   quot Covid quot  deaths may see a huge surge  but total deaths are the same now as they  39 ve ever been.  Sadly  many of the dead would have likely expired from their pre existing conditions anyway.

I hope for the better.  People need to realize that Goebbels was referring to the tactics of their enemies in his  quot accuse your enemy that which you are guilty of quot  quote. He wasn  39 t talking about what the Nazis did.  The man of unity...   I will be a president for red states and blue states  no matter who you voted for   Joe Biden   Funny  he looks every day closer to Josef Stalin  in how he conspires with his close circle on ways to make anything that makes him uncomfortable  quot dissappear quot .  He never sniffed little girls.  More like chernenko  a sickly enfeebled place holder put into power by shadowy desperate actors to prevent reformers empowered under andropov from continuing.  Joe Biden is a traitor  Don t worry.  Give him a few seconds before he completely forgot what he said...  The funny thing is  I haven t seen him look like the feeble idiot he was looking like back in October. Now  I have no idea if this is intentional media suppression  I mean  obviously they are not going to allow him to look bad   or if there s a chance of the feeble old man act was a charade  Since the election is over  he can limit his media appearances. Biden has suffered a mental decline over the past decade or so  but it  39 s only really apparent when he  39 s caught off guard.   I just said the same thing yesterday  I think they finally fine tuned the cocktail of drugs hes on.  Plenty of pharmaceutical jacking this dude up...   We should you unite guys    I  39 ve seen the things Cruz has written over the past 2 months  and Trump style  quot rigged election quot  rhetoric ain  39 t it. He was demanding a commission to investigate the claims formally  which  after the unmitigated disaster that was Giuliani  39 s and Sydney Powell  39 s circus  should have been an easy demand for both parties to make just to put to bed the unrest. You don  39 t quash fears of illigitimacy by telling people to f  39  off.  Man  it did not take long for the world to enter full swing dystopia. I want off this wild ride  No. We need to take our country back. This is much bigger than any election.  I watched the fraud happen live on election night and then again during the Georgia runoffs.  I don  39 t need Trump  Ted Cruz or anybody else to tell me what I can clearly see with my own eyes.  Obiden is a feeble  senile old pedophile that the Liberals are controlling like a puppet on strings.  And by doing so he shows who he fears in 2024  Following up a speech about lies with a disgusting lie is so Joe Biden.  Interesting how he has been doing just that for months. Democrat Privilege.  Not spreading lies when you re telling the truth.  To date not a single audit has taken place on the election.  We have 99.9  more evidence than we had in 2018 when we started impeachment on trump for a single whistleblower.   Now we ve had tens of them along with hundreds of affidavits  massive statistical anomalies and of course all that pesky video proof.  Don  39 t they know the more they talk about it the more people are going to start questioning if it  39 s true   He  39 s out of his basement. Nothing can hold them back.. They will just pour it on now...   deleted   I just searched for  quot Pence quot  on Twitter. Don  39 t. Just don  39 t. It  39 s a shit show.  Why    If anyone is the reincarnation of Goebbels....its Biden.  I  39 d say Zuckerberg and Dorsey are more like Goebbels. They  39 re the propaganda arm  after all.  Fair enough   Nice bit of defamation there biden  Important  If you are iPhone the way you stop Apple from deleting Parler from you phone is   Lol that s rich coming from anyone on the left.   When we make apt comparisons to hitler about their actions and beliefs they invoke Godwin s law   He  Fucktadred elect  is already demonizing his competition for the 2024 election.  With biden being silent on the censorship of conservative voices he  39 s just accusing others of what  39 s he  39 s guilty of himself. Supporting efforts that are far more nazi communist than any Cruz has said or done.  The most disheartening thing about the election is the media s lack of interest in the fraud. If the allegations are false  show us don t tell us. In 2016  NPR actually tried to find  fake news.  So why won t they do some investigative journalism now   Afraid of what they might find. Same thing with Hunter Bidens laptop when journalists legit said its not their job to investigate things.   a href  https   youtu.be fNQAbF33gFM  rel  nofollow  https   youtu.be fNQAbF33gFM  a 
t3_ktyrpe,Twitter Banned At Least 60K Conservative Accounts,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ktyrpe/twitter_banned_at_least_60k_conservative_accounts/,While this kind of censoring is happening  people still act like Trump is the sole reason why the US is in such a divided state.  Trump was only ever an effect.  Yep. I know two conservatives who were banned this week. They just  like  and retweeted conservative tweets. Buckle up everyone.  It wont stop at banning people on twitter  facebook  etc.  It will get to banning and suing any site or person with opposing views  just watch.  Already happening.  Look at how Apple and Google are deplatforming Parler.  Watch the  quot hate speech quot  laws that are coming to prevent that. Calling it now.  They are trying to get tv providers to drop Fox News now too  It will he websites next  the cancel people will start harassing web host sites to remove anyone they don t like.  Amazon web services is no longer hosting Parlor  They  39 re going to bring back  quot net neutrality quot  because  you know  they have to protect the inventivness of the internet.  The internet is decentralized. Android ppl are side loading parler fwiw.  I  39 m surprised they haven  39 t created a web interface.  there are some blockchain based social media sites.  I am looking at steemit currently.  I wish more people spoke up when YouTube banned Anwar Al Awlaki videos  which they did after Republicans pressured Google .  Time to move to 4chan  It s scary how many people are supporting the destruction of freedom of speech.  I have a trans friend who is stupidly against freedom of speech like she doesn  39 t understand that it is freedom of speech that allowed her to be a her publicly now without getting attacked for it or whatever. Of course she thinks she gets attacked all the time and actually never has been... She told me that when Trump was elected that roving bands of anti trans we  39 re going to come for her.   YOu sHUt uP nOw   Its freedom from your kind of speech.     And Reddit is along for the ride .  They  39 ve successfully redefined  quot inciting violence quot  to mean disagreeing with them in any way  Twitter when politicians journalists and half the Democrat party excuses or blatently riots destroying lives   I sleep   Make this and post it EVERYWHERE YOU CAN message me and I ll upvote all of them.  They have already redefined conservatives as racist  sexist  bigoted  homophobic  fascist  neo nazi  white suprematists. Therefore  any word they utter is hate speech.  They already said that was  quot hate speech. quot   Tp be fair  disagreement with the left usually ends in violence  by them to us   When you tear out a man  39 s tongue  you are not proving him a liar  you  39 re only telling the world that you fear what he might say.    removed   They wouldn t want to start a civil war  all the conservatives have the guns  Never underestimate someone.  They have been buying guns at a record pace this year.  Not to mention  they control almost all forms of communication.   removed   They won t because it s their mirror reflection. It s the same people.  Some of them won  39 t be woke enough or say the wrong thing  and boom banishment.  The purity test comes for all. I saw this in real time earlier  people arguing the economics of victim hood when it came to China  39 s recent post about uiygurs. They couldn  39 t decide if its worse for uiygurs or minorities in America...  Are you kidding me      No.  The lack of self awareness and the hyperbole of self entitlement.  How the fuck are minorities worse off in American then the Muslim Chinese  Reality isnt their strong suit. The only question is whether we accept the ones who get the axe once censorship comes for them.  Depends if they wake up. But once a useful idiot... always a useful idiot  Give it time.  Liberals are a bunch of sheep following billionaires.  Even if racists are being censored  and by and large these aren  39 t those cases  but I  39 ll humor the argument for a moment.... Would they really rather racists have the opportunity to ban together in solidarity and force them to gather in the shadows rather than in the open where everyone with half a brain can see them for the moronic hate mongers that they are   R politics is a cesspool   removed   Just become the conservative version of ANTIfA  Social media outlets have no right to decide what constitutes racism. It baffles me that people don t grasp that. Social media outlets are not courts  and they don t grant due process. The only reason this stuff should be able to happen is if someone broke the law  which can be determined only after due process. That should not be controversial.  I  39 m pretty sure they would want free speech gone at this point. Any one remember  quot free speech is hate speech quot     There s a Reddit  crisis line  fucking LOL   deleted    Takes a long drag from cigarette ..... you couldn t handle her son....  The direct message people are the definition of loser. They  39 re hilarious to engage. They have no thoughts of their own.  You re giving them too much credit. They ll never get banned because they can t think for themselves. Many of them will likely believe whatever they re told to believe  If history is any indicator you are right  Maoist China . They will never exercise all of the their demons  the left will continue to move the line to remove people that don  39 t fit their ever shifting mold.  The amount of injustice in the world takes a negative logarithmic shape. The supply of actual bigots continually diminishes  so the woke mob must tighten the noose of acceptable behavior to satiate their desire for self gratification. This is why the left eats itself.  Stop sounding so smart. Jk very eloquently stated  It would be a shame if all 60k of those people sued twitter.  Except thanks to section 230  it would go nowhere.  Thanks for nothing GOP   LOL   An angry Twitter employee sent me a message.  They re pathetic   Please copy and paste the text. I d love to hear what the soyboy  or girl  said    Unfortunately  when I was given the option to accept or ignore  I hit ignore.  So I don t have the message saved.  But the gist of it was them quoting my OP  then writing  HAHAHA   Good thing we can afford the best lawyers.   I think the play is someone needs to sue Twitter for defamation. They ll use section 230 as a defence  saying they re not a publisher. The counterpoint will then be showing all their moderation   censorship actions and argue that section 230 doesn t apply to them.  I don  39 t see how a case like that could possibly make it into court.  I don  39 t think you understand how 230 actually works or what it provides. It doesn  39 t protect them from repercussions for allowing them to choose what content is allowed on their platform. It is actually the reverse  it protects them from liability for what IS posted on their platform. These are all services provided by private businesses in a free market  they can choose what to do and have those freedoms to do so. This is a core tenet of small government  free market conservatism.  Sued them for what  It  39 s a private company they can do whatever they want.   removed   They are a platform not a publisher. Platforms don  39 t ban people for political reasons because like the town square or the phone company  they are not held accountable for what is said there.  Private companies are not above the law. They cannot discriminate against people and suppress free speech. Like any other business that needs to follow the laws.  If this sub wasn  39 t already established  it would  39 ve been gone in a matter of months. It  39 s only a matter of time till they come for this sub. Enjoy it while it lasts. Social media is a disease and getting censored might ironically improve many people  39 s lives.  This sub is my last political sub in subscription. If this happens  i do not have to do anything. I will be automatically cancelled as a political user.  Serious question where the hell we gonna go with this is gone  I ve tried discord but it s not organized into coherent threads. Guess I m an old man now but seriously we need somewhere to convey truth.  I asked myself this exact question earlier and came to the conclusion that the right either fights for their right to exist in the same space as the left  or we make our own platforms which are always at the risk of getting removed. I wholeheartedly believe that this sub isn  39 t gonna last for much longer  after that lord knows where conservatives can go. Not  a href   r politics  r politics  a   that  39 s for sure.  Nah fuck that. We go to politics and even the playing field  Of course they did.... Mass censorship... But it  39 s only ok if they do it...  And only if it happens to us  Social media is cancerous  Let them destroy their platform. Conservatives are productive members of society. Advertisers will follow the money to other platforms.  What other platforms. I don  39 t what to have a to have a   39 conservative only  39  or   39 liberal only  39  sites  that will cause people to become absolutely intolerant of anyone who doesn  39 t think like them. I get not having people who are doing illegal things  but I don  39 t believe that  39 s the real reason anyone is being banned. It  39 s purely  quot because we don  39 t want you to have a voice quot   and THAT should be illegal.  I hate to say it but advertising targets left minded people. Uneducated consumers who overpay for stupid shit by and far have left leaning mindsets.  70mil people are a huge demographic. We ve learned to swallow left targeted advertising  so they don t think they have to appeal to us.  Just deleted my account.  You should all do the same.  Just did an hour ago and not regretting it  5 minutes ago  I hardly used it anyways but I surely don t want them to be able to count me as one of their users.  I was one of them.  I guess I should feel honored.  And what terrible and evil thing did you do  Fess up...  What sickens me is all of the  quot republicans quot  still blaming trump and condemning things that weren  39 t wrong. for instance people who just simply attended the rally are having to apologize  step down from positions  etc.... even if they didn  39 t do anything violent or enter the building etc.... All the dumb republicans going right along with it need to be voted out.  At some level trump has to be aware of the winds out there and the information seems to be that he doesn  39 t know the pulse of what  39 s going on.  I knew this was possible.  You just had to look at thedonald to know it was possible.  Generally  I  39 m a fan when that website was being good but tossing treason flags at everybody is bad.  The rolling rally part  that  39 s good... but man the wheels came off.  At some level I don  39 t blame their frustration levels  I really do... but the states did jack all and you expect some savior moment if you zerg rush the capital   That ain  39 t happening.  Lin Wood ain  39 t delivering documents from a chariot from heaven.  I support the right of private companies to choose with whom they do business. The argument that the company is large or popular enough that it should be deemed a  quot Public Space Square quot  doesn  39 t sound very conservative at all. Sounds a lot more like what socialist countries do  nationalize private business and put them under state control.  Or the fact that 3 of the 4 biggest tech companies just killed off the competition for the other members of the elite club.  That is monopolistic.  That is antitrust law territory.  While I believe the government often needs to keep their hands off they made this monster.  They gave them more protections.  These companies are the new Ma Bells.  I agree. I think they are a company  thus they have the right to host not host whatever content as they please.  Do you realize that you  39 re missing the point  This was a coordinated effort by the biggest names in the tech world to silence and shut down competition. They  39 re literally strong arming businesses out of their market share. And people are willingly jumping off that cliff to support this.   removed    removed   Yeah. New pictures have been dropping. More to come.  We are at war. Have you ever listened to Steve Bannon  39 s war room   Lmfao. He s literally a pedo crackhead who sold Russian and Chinese access to his father  the now president elect and CNN cried Russia and wonders why we don t take MSM news seriously.   links please   If Trump had truly lost  none of this would be happening.  Oh look at all the awards for this great news.  It  39 s always wonderful to see censorship in action.  Praise be to our tech overlords.  It s time for American s to ban Twitter.  Safe to say Freedom of speech doesn  39 t exist anymore  They didn  39 t ban my account. Must not be conservative enough. Or maybe it  39 s because I only have 82 followers.  Xi  Biden cultural revolution is here  I just don  39 t see this as censorship.  These are private corporations.  They can pick and choose who they do business with.  Important  If you are iPhone the way you stop Apple from deleting Parler from you phone is   Only 88 million more users to purge... This might not be a sustainable business model  Jokes on them  I banned myself first. Account deleted.  Don  39 t comment in this thread. Reddit will be next.  Global technocrat elite don  39 t want critical thinkers with differing ideas and that  39 s obvious.  I guess they re now a publisher.   removed   That  39 s kind of an insult to parasites.  This is so ridiculous. If we can get this under control now  there will be no limit to who they cannot ban. Trump is the most powerful person in the free world and they have banned him  Do not become dependent on any particular social media platform or online forum. Especially this one. Be ready to have to look for new locations online to have any discussions that would be considered wrongthink. In fact you should already have found some by now. If you depend on anything too much  it will be too hard to figure out how to do without it when the choice not to use it is no longer yours.  The whole thing is to cause panic and avoid conservatives spreading hunters laptop drops.  This just proves that they ve been planning this all along.  Mine was one of them.

t3_ku4aim,Hang Mike Pence trends on Twitter after platform suspends Trump for risk of incitement of violence,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku4aim/hang_mike_pence_trends_on_twitter_after_platform/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  https   discord.gg conservative  a   I just searched for  quot Pence quot  on Twitter. Don  39 t. Just don  39 t. It  39 s a shit show.  There is no rational reason to go on Twitter... ever.  It  39 s a bunch of seething TDS  39 ers calling for the public execution of Donald Trump.  If you don  39 t have mental health issues  spend an hour on Twitter and afterwards  you will.  Twitter remains the single best way to keep up with breaking news. It  39 s inherent to the structure of the platform where everyday citizens can read and see tweets in real time as opposed to waiting for full articles to be written after the fact. It  39 s full of bullshit and people I don  39 t ideologically agree with  but when real shit is going down you  39 ll find out breaking information from twitter first before any other source.  Yep. They can literally call for Donald Trump  39 s death but how dare you ask for free and fair elections    Some users were quick to point out that the trending item was not due to fresh threats  but rather that users were circulating a video from the Wednesday riot at the U.S. Capitol.  Using their own logic  Doesn t matter  Users were using Twitter to spread violence. They need to be deplatformed  Are we all missing the bigger point here  Trump is such a narcissist that he threw Pence  his loyal right hand man  under the bus and put Pence s life in danger. Trump knew Pence cant change the votes and used Pence as the fall guy.  No amount of loyalty to trump is ever enough. If you aren t willing to completely beclown yourself  Giuliani style  he will eventually throw you under the bus.  Or if you attempt a violent coup and fail  trump will throw you under the bus. This is what he does. To him  there are two kinds of people. Those who can be useful to him  and the scum of the earth.  Agree  So many things   Let s be really clear. A slightly different chain of events yesterday  and some of these terrorists may have gotten to Pence. He was rooms away from a dude with zip ties asking where mike pence was.    What I  39 m trying to understand is how was the security this soft to even allow even the slightest chance of anything happening  Like  quot a guy with zipties quot  was allowed to be a perceived threat against the second in command of the most powerful country in Earth  Wasn  39 t zip tie man unarmed  Where was the secret service  Hell where was any security even amounting to what you see at a concert venue or something. Wtf  Trump is a lying  bullying  narcissist snake. I voted for Trump and gave him a pass on peddling lies about mass fraud thinking he was just trying to save face. I cant believe he would go this far to throw Pence under the bus.  Reminder that Twitter and other social media is not representative of the real world  But Trump gets banned for inciting violence   Brigaders coming down hard on this tiny thread  It s not like they have anything better to do with their lives   removed   Its only bad if conservatives do it. Otherwise threats of violence and doxxing are not only allowed  they are encouraged.  The people chanting this were trump supporters.  I doubt that.  You think the people waving trump flags and storming the capitol chanting  hang mike pence  are on the left   Source  Because i didint hear or see people chanting  quot hang mike pence quot  during that shitshow.  Lol Fox News  Because they have been such a bastion of truth....  Are you seriously incapable of clicking the hyperlinked part of the article that takes you to a video  aka a primary source  No wonder you re unable to defend your points and choose to deny reality instead.  Some people just refuse any information that conflicts with their pre established conclusions.  Then actually prove it was the left. So far there has been zero proof that it was anyone other than Trump supporters.   What I don  39 t get is why conservatives absolutely MUST have a psychopathic narcissist to advance the conservative agenda  Is the Republican Party so devoid of honorable people that trump is the only way  I don  39 t believe that.  It isn  39 t that  they are being ignored by both parties  and only one party allows for gun rights and is anti censorship  in terms of only political speech   the otherside is anti gun rights and is pro censorship  in terms of political speech.   This is the true story of this past year.  Looks like years to come as well  Dems in control  time to get away with everything. Dems will protect them as long as they are on the same side.  And big tech just sits by with this obvious hypocrisy. Per usual. There are rules for democrats who hate trump  and then their are rules for us.  Important  If you are iPhone the way you stop Apple from deleting Parler from you phone is   And Twitter bans everyone that says this is violence.  Parler APK version here..... Bypass Play Store   DM  me if you  39 re still having trouble. You may need to scroll partially down and get Version V2.6.9... Happy to help if needed.

All news articles i have seen done site anything specific.  The readership of Arstechnica is in favor of this move   foolish and shortsighted. They re conflating those who call for violence with everyone else who uses parlor.  Yes. Once they go to central bank digital currency  they will be able to manipulate your bank account directly.  They ll probably only allow grocery transactions. The social credit score in action.  You give them too much credit.  Scary times for 1st amendment  What does this have to do with the first amendment   Let me help you understand something.  A total free market is anarcho capitalism.  If that isn t becoming obvious to you now and you re still not seeing a problem with this then I m not sure how else to explain it.  The Constitution should reach beyond just the government.  The constitution limits what the government can do to its citizens  not what citizens can do to each other.  I think apple  google  and Amazon are wrong to deplatform parler but bringing the first amendment into the argument isn t the right strategy.    What happens when large multinationals work closely with political parties to coordinate in a way that maximizes profit and power for both. Does the multinational still count as a private citizen  free to suppress who they will  or should we begin to consider tightly coupled public private entities differently   This is  a href   r Conservative  rel  nofollow  r Conservative  a   not  a href   r Libertarian  rel  nofollow  r Libertarian  a . If private companies do shady stuff that  39 s against our principles  free speech being one of the most important  if not THE most important of them   we call that shit out.  Cutting off channels to a select group trying to speak freely is the same as stripping the first amendment from them.  Everyone has the right to free speech in the US.  The  right to refuse service  cannot override this.  Take a look at the rights to be heard during the civil rights movements.  Thanks   I thought it was obvious   Try real hard  and you might be able to figure it out.

Considering the first decade of his career was essentially blackface comedy  I m surprised he isn t cancelled already.

Since Democrats have a history of dragging truck drivers into the street and beating them to death.  Yes   Treat them to their own medicine to have them experience how evil they are.  This would be awesome.  If America is to move forward then this undoubtedly must happen. Farmers must withold their produce from blue states. Truckers must refuse to deliver goods to liberal cities. Small businesses have the right to refuse business and deny gainful employment to any Democrat. Many talk of a coming Civil War but economic sanctions first and foremost can avoid the violence that war would bring  Amazing how people are so happy to throw away their rights because it is against someone they don t like. Until it starts affecting them  but it ll be too late.  Thats the thing. They don  39 t think they  39 re taking away their rights. What they  39 re excited about is our rights being stripped from us while they get to keep all of theirs.

t3_kukcpd,Clyburn House may hold impeachment proceedings after Bidens first 100 days,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kukcpd/clyburn_house_may_hold_impeachment_proceedings/,They ve got impeachment on the brain.  Is that even legal  I mean  can they take away his right to run for office after he leaves the office   Impeach a President after they  39 ve left office  Next will they impeach FDR for the internment camps  Truman for dropping the bomb  make another run at Andrew Johnson  How about Washington through Grant for owning slaves    Of course. It s about preventing Trump from standing again. They re obviously not stupid and know it wasn t an insurrection but a riot made worse by the capital police dropping the ball   they re pushing this narrative to sell the impeachment. I won t be surprised if behind the scenes many of the republicans in the senate at least want them to do it.  Why wait 100 days  Begin impeachment proceedings  strong against Biden  strong  the day he takes office.  No no  they ll 25th amendment him just after 2 years so kamala can serve 10 years  Start impeaching her too.  These people are insane.  It  39 s a waste of time in my view. If you want Trump to settle down go the next 10 days  squeezing him in a corner is the last thing you want to do..  It  39 s like they  39 ve never read any history books. This is literally the situation Julius Caesar was in. The Senate wanted to prosecute him for all manner of crimes  real and imagined  while Pompey tried everything he could to get him an escape plan. His only rational option was to cross the river Rubicon.  Stop wasting my money  Half of it went overseas and now they want to spend it on Trumps impeachment as a treat to all of us Americans.  I wanna see Dave Ramsey get drunk and go over the US spending budget.   Unite   Impeach a man no longer in office  What  They are terrified he will run again in 2024. They just don  39 t get it  they are projecting their hated of us  regular plain working Americans  onto Trump. It  39 s us they hate  he is just our ambassador in Washington.          I just don t get it. There s so many other things they could focus on.. but they want to waste our Money and time on that shit..  What would be the point of impeaching Donald Trump after he leaves office   I know there s a lot of talk  but he s not going to run for president in 2024.  I m sure he ll endorse someone  but he s not going to put himself through that again.  I understand  even if I think it s ridiculous  impeaching him now.  But once Joe Biden is sworn in President Trump is NO LONGER president.  What would impeachment even do   It  39 s about sending a message. They hate anyone not aligned with the establishment.

Trump wasn  39 t too vile to associate with during his presidency up until now even though people were slinging dangerous terms like  quot Nazi quot  around back then too. It  39 s just a convenient time to pretend you want nothing to do with him.  I am an old lady. I never thought that America would become a country that weaponized freedom of thought.  You ain t old if you were born in 66. But yes it has become the  thing to do.   If you are the right your thoughts are evil and must be stopped. All the more to know that we are on the right side of history and propaganda and Braine asking from the left is just going to get worse. Be prepared for a fight. As they won t stop here.

I m told Ben Sasse is a putz  With Senators like Ben  who needs democrats   I mean  they literally called the federal agents stoping riots stormtroopers and didn  39 t apologize.  The left doesn t truly know or want to know history. When they saw stormtroopers they thought Star Wars.  I  39 m so sick of this bs working on people  You have conservatives here in compete denial.  Sounds about right given his  we love you video   Yes he was clearly singling out the hundreds breaking into the Capitol  now you know the tens of thousands outside protesting peacefully.  Same excuse as Charlottesville then   Why is this upvoted   Probably because people  myself included  are frustrated of trump s inability to call out and condemn his supporters who say or do bad things. Instead he gives a confusing statement that allowed his opponents to argue these statements are actually supporting the bad behavior. His  we love you  video was a great example. If you watch the entire video he s basically saying the rioters were justified and then says to go home. Not good enough. That video is what made me lose faith in him.  How did he say the rioters were justified exactly   Here s the transcript   I didn  39 t think there was anything wrong with that speech. Majority of the people inside the Capitol didn  39 t even do anything  that  39 s a fairly appropriate response. I also feel a little sympathy despite not accepting what they did.

Not saying they should have broken in  but they sure do like to pretend they survived an all out assault.  BLM calls that a  quot slow Tuesday quot   I don  39 t think it was great either but compared to what has been going on  it was absolutely nothing.  Exactly. I  39 m getting downvoted  but this just really paled in comparison and I don  39 t understand the reaction level.  I  39 m told Bens wife  39 s boyfriend is delighted as well.   quot I read it on a bathroom wall...  quot   More  I heard it from an anonymous source   I guarantee it was the Dems who were delighted  Dickless over here.

It s political  his state really fucked up the election and he s trying to deflect the heat.  He s retiring in 2022.  You re correct  I was just counting the term years from his last election.  I ve edited my comment to remove reference to re election.  Thank fucking god  he s such a piece of shit senator anyway. I m so ready to MAYBE have the chance to vote in an anti establishment guy. But knowing the PA republicans  there s a fat chance of that. The politics of my state are way too fucked up. They didn t throw their weight behind Scott Wagner  and now we re stuck with Furher Wolf who doesn t get near as much bad press as he deserves.  This massive attack against Trump is just to remind the population that if you are not a political insider  you are not allowed to run for President.  And if you dare to vote for an outsider  you ll be punished.   deleted   PA is controlled by Philadelphia. The only republicans that come out of New England are RINOs  Sad but true. Its disgusting how that one mess of a city controls the entire state.  We have a few good ones at the state level.  Unfortunately we have a few areas that are quite crowded and known for corruption.  Kinda kills it for the rest of us.  They  39 re so eager to impeach him when his term should expire in less than 2 weeks  doesn  39 t that feel a bit off   Of they vote to impeach him again he cannot run for president again.  That s not true. Unless he is convicted by the Senate  being impeached means nothing.  He has already been impeached. He wasn  39 t removed from office. The senates job is to convict and remove from office. An impeachment is just an indictment not a conviction..  In 4 years they probably won  39 t have a pandemic to use for rigging an election.  This will prevent him from being eligible.  You re underestimating how far Democrat s are willing to go to rig an election.  Trumps best quality is his ability to get people to remove their masks.  Weve seen it from the left  and now were seeing it from the fraudulent right.  Hah that s a joke. Toomey is so corrupt.  Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey ... what happened to that poor guy   No one knows or remembers.   One day he was in office.  Next election he was just gone....we heard he had just 1 vote.   Oh that poor man  what s his name again   Pat something.. Pat Romney   I think he s not seeking re election.    Go figure  And pelosi didnt commit treason   She tried to start a military coup  When  She went to the joint chiefs and tried to have them take his power away.  Basically  asking for a military  coup. They told her no because  of that  Lmao. What a piece of shit  I hope you mean her  Of course  Exactly. Treason.  I still dont see what Trump said in his speech that is impeachable or led to what occurred.  He could have not even made a speech and they were going to blame him.   That  39 s what it comes down to.  This is what I came here to say  too. I watched the entire speech live on air and heard nothing wrong  except normal Trump rambling . I think it s BS he called Pence a coward  but maybe that s just me.   He did and said nothing. They are terrified that he will declassify documents which will show their crimes.  Didn t Trump call him a RINO recently  Sounds like wittle Toomey s feewings were hurt.   removed   Toomey has hated Trump all along. Fuck him.  The Deep State really wants Trump to never be able to run again. Gotta protect the swamp at all costs.  Wow they really don  39 t want to get reelected do they   Dems don  39 t have to be worried about reelection. They have proven american and the court systems don  39 t care about cheating to get into office and we are destined for many years to come democratic control. These are the end times for the constitutional republic we all learned to love.   em top  em  republican...  As opposed to a bottom Republican like Lindsey Graham.  Toomey is a RINO cuck and always has been. I m disgusted that he represents the conservatives of my state.  Being   You are looking pretty small at this moment. Put the shovel down.

They re lost Billions now   Bunch of feminist idiots   I find it mind boggling that a company would insult its entire customer base.     yep  if I recall they even had the audacity  stupidity  to launch their anti men campaign during the Super Bowl  Boy I didn  39 t even know about this one. Glad to be enlightened.  Get a DE safety razor and save a ton of money. A handle costs no more than a Gilette handle. The blades cost  20 for a year supply or more  depending on how often you shave  your hair and such. Plus you can really go down the rabbit hole and get nice shave cream like Taylor of Old Bond Street and make shaving something you enjoy.  I ll need to check that out. Thanks for the info  Yep  corporations care about buying power. They seem to think pandering to Dems will yield them the most dollars. Only way to change it is to prove them wrong  I haven  39 t.

If everyone on Twitter only repeats what everyone else says  why read it   Why post anything   who cares about what Biden says if it  39 s poltispeak   Twitter like all social media thrives on strife. The most active conversations are between arguing individuals. If a whole  quot side quot  of an argument decides to leave they have no one to argue with and engagement declines.   Let them.

Like... there are subs that post unmoderated  unverified age pornography and it goes unchecked. How is this different  Parler moderates. It just doesn  39 t arbitrate every little thing said.  Ditto Snapchat  which basically exists for underage people to send nudes to one another  and everyone knows this...    Personally I don  39 t like the tag that Parler is  quot conservative quot .  I would hope that free speech and protection of free exchange of ideas would be a non partisan issue.  What  39 s even scarier is how many people on the left think they  39 re so woke and yet totally blind to the corporate control that they claim to be against.  Narrator  it isn t.  That s just not true about Snap anymore. In the past it was definitely a major selling point of the app  and even subtlety advertised as such  but at this point the app has many other larger draws.  I think the point being made is Parlor is being removed due to  lack of moderation  yet a LOT of platforms have a REAL lack of moderation and things like child porn get posted to the platform all the time unchecked  Reddit  Twitter  Snapchat  yet the apps will continue to get to operate because liberals.  The thing is parlor is not even conservative. It  39 s been around for a few years and didn  39 t start out political. Everyone and anyone can go on parlor and they do. Conservatives have been flocking to it as of late however because of the censorship going on with the arrest of social media.  Being a pedophile isn t as bad as being conservative these days. Pretty fucked up.  Many of them call it pedosexual now. Fucking disgusting  Parler moderates  they post the rules and when users report rule breaking posts the Parler moderation team manually reviews the reported content. If it breaks ToS  which includes breaking US laws on non protected speech  such as incitement of violence  CP  unlawful threats  etc.     em as defined by our courts  em   then the content is removed and the user is warned or removed from the service.  Reddit has the right politics  Can  39 t have apps that actually believe in that pesky 1st amendment. Everyone must toe the uniparty narrative.  Apple is fine with children dying to mine materials to make their phones though.  All of this posturing by Google and especially Apple is all posturing. It  39 s the same as Nike decrying violence in the US as children labor in sweatshops. It  39 s a farce to get people to buy their products  1984  Social media blocking their competition before they can get popular.  One might call it collusion.  Only if one had a spine to enforce one  39 s call.  I call them scared that they might lose market share.  How are those slave labor camps going  Apple   Google did too  they  39 re trying to get a monopoly on this stuff.   Hang mike pence  is trending on Twitter right now. I bet they ll take action against them as well  s  Unreal.   It s funny they cite lack of moderation. In their terms of service they say you provide the content for you page and you take care of your own page. If you want to block or ban people who are causing issues  you do it.   That  39 s where we are at in the world right now.  THIS IS THEIR GOAL. This is exactly how they want people to think. Don t think for yourself  let the government think for you. Nothing you do can be wrong if it was approved by the government.  Ah yes  censorship  Moderation is the P.C. word for censorship. Users of Parler didn  39 t sign up for that. It  39 s about the free flow of ideas whatever they are.  Moderation  You mean patriots refusing to conform to extreme left wing propaganda.  Big tech  We need to have unity  Whoa   deleted   At this point they are driving the fuel tanker straight into the flame.  In this new digital age  to protect our 1A rights  either Facebook and Twitter need to be free speech platforms. Or the government needs to make their own and make it illegal to take anything down. This censorship is a direct violation of our rights. Stfu about this  private company  bullshit. This is much different.  I m sorry but some of the people on Parler are nut jobs  they deserve the right to speak but I also have the right to say they are crazy  Sounds like an apple boycott coming....  They banned it because they re totalitarian fascists.  I updated my iPhone settings so it won t delete apps I already have installed with updates.  I disabled automatic updates after Reddit forced that stupid  virtue signaling BLM icon.  Thanks for the tip.  Where do you do this   Settings   gt  screen time   gt  content and privacy restrictions  gt  iTunes and App Store purchases   gt  deleting apps   gt  don t allow  Yikes.  I guess I don t really need a MacBook Pro... gonna get the cheapest iPhone I can find too... fuck big tech and fuck these billionaires and the politicians bent over for them.

That will be two bunches of easy Electoral votes for Dems every cycle  along with new additions to Senate and Congress.  Great....  On a surface level  yeah add more states. Cause  thats what we need when we can t even keep the same constitutional standards across states that we already have.  You can resolve that problem of representation by assigning all residents of DC belonging to either Virginia or Maryland.  Ohhh I think these states will want their land back  All of the land that was originally Virginia  essentially Arlington and Alexandria  was ceded back to Virginia in 1846. While I agree the the best solution would be to shrink the actual district to just include the federal building around the mall  both the Maryland government and many citizens groups in the district have said they do not want the land ceded to Maryland.  If DC is granted statehood...then California should be allowed to split into two states. One Conservative and one loony leftist.  As a member of Commifornia  I agree with you 100  and I would be moving to the Conservative part.  Wonderful   Same with Oregon and Washington  Ore  amp  Wash state should merge into one state. Called Northern California. Then split down the middle north to south. The eastern part could then be absorbed by Idaho.  They  39 d just encourage migration from the left side to the right side to flip it left.  Scary but possible. We would have to  em build a wall  em  to maintain our independence.  ...and so it begins    Never will they get the 38 states behind it.  What could be worse then allowing election fraud to push mandates   The only way dc becomes a state is an amendment we ll be fine

t3_ktw3mn,Twitter allows Hang Mike Pence to trend hours after Trump ban,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ktw3mn/twitter_allows_hang_mike_pence_to_trend_hours/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  https   discord.gg conservative  a   Twitter should be banned for inciting violence  I heard Apple and Google are removing the apps from their respective stores  s  Repeal 230 please  The Useless and pathetic GOP overturned Trumps veto just to keep section 230  and take away Trumps ability to remove troops from the Middle East   Useless and pathetic is the best way to describe the GOP right now. Its going to be almost impossible to get control of the narrative with big tech social media in control.  The the only thing that will fix these issues is lawsuits.  If only they could get sued over this without a government protection.  Yes   removed   Although to be fair  the  quot hang Mike pence quot  slogan was uttered by pro Trump protestors. And there are pictures of them setting up a gallow. That  39 s very unsettling.  But they let it stay up despite being extremely violent  It doesn t matter who all posted it   Twitter should have banned them all for inciting violence.  I never supported or excused the behavior of those involved in the capital riot.  I m just pointing out the hypocrisy of people and organizations that are selectively outraged and excuse violence or threats of violence that they agree with.  Big tech companies control the flow of our communication  and they are clearly demonstrating their selective censorship.  Context does matter. If the reason that it is trending is because people are talking about the fact that some people went to the capitol building and said those words   then yeah  let if trend. People should know that happened. It  39 s horrible  and twitter shouldn  39 t hide reality.   What a surprise...  Isn  39 t it trump supporters screaming that   It doesn t matter who s saying it m  Twitter should of took it down.  Fuck Twatter  Twitter said they had taken corrective action.  Fuck twitter pos website  Isn t the bigger story that people were rushing the Capitol building  with the VPOTUS in it  chanting to kill him  We can talk about twitter and all. But Trump literally turned on Pence  called him a coward  while stoking this angry mob.   I think they are both important take aways.  Trump fucked up big time. And the big tech companies  39  responses are also big fuck ups. It  39 s just shit all the way around unfortunately.  Because Trump is gone. Their monopoly isn t.  You have  em no  em  foresight do you   Censorship by big tech and the media is exactly why we ended up with a mob of angry trump supporters storming the Capitol in the first place. More censorship is going to stoke those flames. I think it s a pretty important takeaway  personally.  Big tech abusing their monopoly like power to control free communication is a huge issue.  It s the new MySpace.    Only a matter of time  Not fair to bring MySpace down to their level  When will y all realize this has nothing to do with a logical reason to ban Trump    Rules for thee and not for me .  Can we go back to walls being racist   When you realize Twitter bans based off of political beliefs and not actual policies.  So its time to ban 58k people if they  39 re going to be consistent about their own rules  Can we just stop giving a shit about twitter in general now  It  39 s such a cesspool.  How long do you think a tweet like that would last if it said Kamala Harris instead of Pence   It would ve been to taken down before it even got put up  Wait why Mike Pence  I thought he was now a  savior  to the left since he disagreed with Trump  The insurrection rioters were chanting this in the white house. its trump followers not the left who started this  Oh wow  ok  Apparently it was right wingers who started it. But its bs to pretend all ideologues on Twitter weren  39 t joining in...  Goodbye twitter  you suck. Cancelled early this morning.  Were all about anti violence here at twitter  Twitter is the ultimate shithole  Twitter is a hot mess right now and so is everyone using it. I don  39 t have it but if you do I suggest deleting it for a week until the initial madness or the ignorant fizzles out  Yeah but those posting it aren  39 t the POTUS.   deleted   I really think this is a violation of the law and Jack Dorsey needs to be arrested for allowing his platform be used as a means to threaten the life of a vice president. THis man is a fucking criminal and needs to be charged .  That s the rub   if Twitter is a  platform   he gets legal protection from what other people post  but then he has to allow diverse political opinions.   Since Twitter is picking and choosing what they like  they re acting as a  publisher  so they shouldn t get legal protection.
t3_ku5rwm,Amazon cuts off Parlers web hosting following Apple Google bans,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku5rwm/amazon_cuts_off_parlers_web_hosting_following/,This is just a quid pro quo between big tech and the democrats. Democrats get their opponents censored  meanwhile big tech gets to remove their competition and the Dems promise to leave them alone.  We re witnessing the death of the American republic in real time  It  39 s scary and it  39 s much faster than I ever feared.  It started back in the late 1960 s. Some of us have been watching it creep slowly over the years. The leftists just have more power now because the GOP after Reagan turned into wimps and started out Dem the Democrats.  Trump forced their hand. Better this than a slow boil.  People of America NOW KNOW.  This is true.   Watchung the left cheer this shit on online is even scarier. I didn  39 t want to understand what it had to be like in the purges of China  USSR  and the nazis.   removed   The damn we need to be better people are screwed and are such an issue  Just cancelled my prime membership and will close the whole account if they follow through.  BOYCOTT THEM and all the other Sellouts  This is honestly getting insane.  Cancel prime  The fact that these billion dollar corporations feel so confident to brazenly do this is really scary. They know they will have no repercussions for silencing mainstream conservative figures and creating a chilling effect for anyone not radically left.   In the future this will be asked  Where were you the day free speech died on 10th January 2021    Well thats before the Constitution Restoration then came and leftism in America was gone.  It took 48 hours from its removal from the play store to its total shutdown. Big tech came in and said if you thought you could find free speech on your own you were wrong.  Did they state that a specific TOS was violated in order to do this ban   I mean  this is insane..  How can this be legal   Coup completed  On orders from Xi Jinping....

t3_ku76c0,Parler could be SHUTDOWN from midnight Sunday after Amazon warned it would shut its servers off,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku76c0/parler_could_be_shutdown_from_midnight_sunday/, em Got banned  em        Watching everyone declare they re finally cancelling their Amazon Prime accounts as well as suggest moving to ebay to make online purchases has me quite confused to be frank. One of my biggest concerns through the pandemic has been how to help small businesses during shutdowns. That s been a talking point all over this sub as well  especially as lockdown has driven margins for Amazon even more sky high than before. But alas i find it intriguing that so many here obviously did nothing to  em use the free market  em  for the benefit of the things they vehemently claim is important to them  small businesses   but instead let the free market use them.   Everyone has a line. This just happened to be it for many.  I only ever use Amazon if I can  39 t find what I want in the store. I  39 m super old school and like walking into a store and picking up what I need. I hate ordering things online and having to wait for it to be mailed out.  The same logic applies to Parler  they didn  39 t have a backup plan for being canceled by a know left wing organization like Amazon. Same with the people that refused to transition from Twitter to Parler. And before you get all hung up on small businesses  where do you think small businesses get some of their products from  What about the self employed people that sell products on Amazon  So while it  39 s true that we did too little too late and that we need to support more local businesses we have to acknowledge that large businesses like Amazon exist for a reason  they provide services to more than just every day consumers. We need to organize efforts to get people unhooked from these left wing tech companies and media outlets.  Amazon helps small business a lot more than Walmart or other big box stores. Most the time when you shop on Amazon you  39 re actually buying from a small business. Even when it  39 s FBA. Just avoid buying  quot AmazonBasics quot  products because those are made in China and distributed solely through the Amazon system.  if you aren t comfortable masking up inside local businesses then just buy directly from small businesses online. Amazon takes a cut off the top even if it s the product of a small business with the promise of  faster shipping . Take the  6 hit and put more money in the hands of people in your community and less in the hands of Jeff Bezos  My small business sells on Amazon and we  39 ve increased our revenue significantly by using FBA  so I see  quot canceling Amazon quot  as something that will hurt people like me.   Were are watching the digital purge escalate dramatically. In just over 24 hours  the president was digitally unpersoned  millions of voices online were silenced  and millions of people are publicly calling for genocide. Including members of the government. And all you guys can think to say is  quot well  I guess I  39 ll cancel my subscription. quot   And what are you doing about it   Calling people out on their bullshit  researching whether running for state office is a good idea for me  and I  39 m ready to take more direct action if the opportunity presents itself. Like the other guy said  it  39 s not going to stay digital for long  we need to be ready to fight back.  We need a completely different digital setup for the conservatives. I have replaced many liberal apps on my phone.  People who think this is just digital are fooling themselves.   So how is this not a breach in contract between parler and AWS   AWS is claiming Parler is breaking their TOS by not censoring their users when if they call for violence  which means it is within Amazon  39 s right to terminate the contract.  lefties running coercing  courts    One less bill I guess  Color me surprised. Looks like my Prime subscription is def getting canceled. Was already considering it based on Bezos and the ineffectiveness of the service all last year but this seals the deal.  Just cancelled mine   Suck it Amazon.  Well now it s obvious it was completely planned out.  Not before Amazon can forward all of the patriots that are registered on the site to the 1619 project and the Lincoln project to be out in the list of supporters for trump.  Can boycott all you want  Amazon is still going to be around  and   most of the small businesses going out of business now anyway will force more people to use Amazon. It  39 s a delayed effect since there were the smallest amount of bankruptcies  ever in 2020  but once all the protections run out from COVID there will be mass bankruptcies  you will be forced to use the giant corporations that were able to stay open because Gov said so.  Amazon is going to piss off 75 million amazon customers. Good luck with that...  A lot of people have no idea this is going down. We are far more informed than most people. There are huge numbers of people who have no clue what parler even is.  Yup my family just canceled our prime membership  I m going to shop more on eBay.  I noticed many resellers on amazon are also on eBay.  Same.  Just cancelled mine.  Done.  Man... Mine was still running on the student  cheapo version too even though I graduated a year ago.  Damnit... Cancelled.  No one is cancelling  Any ideas on how the cancellation refund works  My prime renewed a few months back  wondering how much they ll stiff me for cancelling now.  If they don  39 t give you the refund on your first request they will eventually if you continue to contact them.  They  39 ll probably try and stiff you for the full price. You can always try doing a charge back and dispute the charge with your credit card company though if they won  39 t give a pro rated refund.  Generally you  39 re cancellation takes effect when the service would run out.  If you want a refund you  39 ll have to go through their CS.  Which.... Not that good.  It  39 s fantastic for package returns  at least in my experience.  But for memberships... Not a clue.  I  39 ve dealt with AWS and they are atrocious.  Amazon committing suicide  Looks like I will be buying local. No more Amazon.  If you are a conservative  don  39 t use Amazon for your web hosting.  They could disrupt and disarm your business on a dime.  Get out of your house and go shopping at your local stores. Novel idea. Right  I  39 m not talking Wal Mart either  Rebuild America.  Thankfully I live in a very small town  1300 pop   and local business is the best way to get anything  as long as you can find it in stock. Which most of the time you can  if not they order it and two days later they have it for you.  No business in my town or the next town over  2300 pop  have been shut down. I will always support local small businesses over big retailers if I can and I know most of these communities feel the same. Beeter business  better people and its the neighborly thing to do.  There s other web hosting services out there  azure  but it s kind of hard to transition your apps services smoothly overnight.

t3_ku60yh,Free Speech Platform Gab Reports 750 Increase in Traffic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku60yh/free_speech_platform_gab_reports_750_increase_in/,Yeah. Servers are currently undergoing maintenance as I speak. I believe this maintenance involves adding even more servers to handle the exponentially increased user total.  Most of alt tech is racing to buy servers.  Minds  Gab  Rumble  Parler  they  39 re all getting massive spikes in people.  And next the ISPs will claim they are violating their policies and will shut them down as well.    I believe Gab has their own server infrastructure  so while their growth has been incredibly slow  big tech will have a hard time shutting them down.  The point is the ISPs and the other infrastructure providers will be next.  That is what just happened in Hong Kong.    Why   Gab hasn t had an app in a long time. They had all this happen to them a couple of years ago after the synagogue shooting. After that they built their own infrastructure so they can t be deplatformed by companies like Amazon. That s also why it s really hard to get on right now. They ve had to order and install more servers to handle the extra traffic.  Good. I can deal with the reality of them needing time to scale up. Ill join them.  Nice to see they have some resistance to deplatforming  They  39 ve been several steps ahead for the past couple of years just by using plain common sense. What happened to Parler should have been easily predicted.  I was blown away that parler was using aws. I  39 m an idiot for assuming they wouldn  39 t make a huge error like that.  Amazon is gone from this household. GONE  I have 2 shares in Amazon and 2 more in alphabet. Think I will get rid of them  There is no app that can hide from apple and Google  if it  39 s removed from the app store it  39 s all over. You  39 d need billions and billions of Capitol just to compete. Google would attack you  it would take 10 years or so. Were all fucked.  Then again  on android you could download the app straight off the internet and install it.  Well Gab isn t an app anymore. They ve streamlined their code so the site runs better on your phones web browser.  So wait  Apple and Google are banning Parler because they  refuse to moderate  and risk inciting violence  yet they also won t allow gab app on their stores even though they DO moderate against violence and comply with their guidelines. So what s the common denominator here other than free speech social media   Control.  Monopoly  Decades of political refusal to take all kinds of monopolies seriously is really coming to bit us in the ass.  I saw that Gab CEO is releasing a Gabphone  It s a pixel without anything google and improved security as well as a different OS. Sounds interesting.  Pinephone runs Linux and is open source iirc.  This is what s gonna happen. Free market thinkers will find a market. I hope it happens dinner rather than later.  Free market wanters just gotta wake up and get their asses off Facebook and Twitter for it to work.  I m hoping Elon makes a move.  He s got so much at stake though. If anybody would put principle against profit its him. But his life  39 s ambition is Tesla and SpaceX he  39 d risk throwing that all away  right at the point where they are achieving his dreams if he too openly went against our new overlords  Personally I hope it happens breakfast rather than later.  Hope it happens  quot dinner quot      Yep. Sunday barbecue and all  That phone will sell like hot cakes. I  39 d be in  that  39 s a no brainer.  Make a Parler. Make a Gab. Parler is in a fight to stay alive right now  while Gab has it  39 s own servers. Parler is more popular right now  Gab is more secure.  Guess we know what the next target of the authoritarian left is.  They ve already been after the CEO he s banned on both app stores and his family is blacklisted from VISA apparently  Takes time to expand infrastructure ...  Expect them to.  Gab run off of the mastodon platform if I recall  which can be distributed. Can t stop the signal.  Yeah it wouldn t even load for me  I can tell they got that much more traffic  Gab was just removed from the apple store  Gab has  em never  em  had an app in the apple store.  I was wrong about that. Someone told me to sign up and get it in the App Store. Saw it wasn t there and thought it was removed. Sorry about that.  They had an app  There wasn t one yesterday on the App Store.  Pretty sure they haven  39 t had an app for a long time. Its web based and streamlined for mobile use   removed   It s impressive that gab is surging without an app... is it wishful thinking to imagine a world where smartphones held a little looser grip on society  Something about it being on you all the time... it s chilling to me. Cant we just do some things on a laptop at home    Annnnnnnnnd it  39 s gone. Google play deleted it  it  39 s all gone.  Hmm.. Still up and working for me.  Just use the website.  Annnnnnnnnd it  39 s gone. Deleted by AWS.

The hatefulness and bitterness in the sub is toxic. And quit blaming Dems for everything. Start being accountable for what your party does.  If you want to see racist toxic people being glorified by there own party you can go back to upvoting the top comments on  a href   r politics  rel  nofollow  r politics  a  bud.  Your inferiority complex with  a href   r politics  rel  nofollow  r politics  a  is palpable. Again. Start being accountable for what your party does. Blaming and whining about everything is not a good look  bud.  Accountability  Of what  Of who we vote for Are you accountable for the policies and actions of the Obama Administration  No you re not. We all vote for the people we hope will lead our party in the right direction. Hope is all we have  we can t possibly know what will happen down the line as we re not fortune tellers. And talking about blaming and whining about everything is rich from a liberal. That s what you ve guys been doing for 4 years strait  daily. Every post and thread on the Internet for 4 years from your party has been whiney sad attempts of hurting Trumps character. Hypocrisy is not a good look  Bud.  Look at all the name calling. You wonder why you get shunned from  a href   r politics  rel  nofollow  r politics  a   yet a quick glance at these comments and you find out why. Calling names on the Internet has got to be the most beta thing ever.  If you express an idea that deviates even a little from the MSM  39 s narrative on  a href   r politics  rel  nofollow  r politics  a  you get shredded by the mindless drones. So get out of here with that  quot name calling quot  bullshit because they are way worse than here. The left demands your obedience the right tries to convince or agree to disagree way more often.  Derp  You complain that all the tech sites are banning you for posting hate and racist messages and yet everything you write is irrelevant and name calling. You can keep it up here  I guess.  You got an extra chromosome or something bud  Just calm down and take a deep breath. Its not a wiener don  39 t take it so hard.  Don t be angry when they call you names when you do the same.    can you define the word palpable for me. it doesn  39 t seem like correct word choice  It s an advanced word that fits perfectly.

Everyone will be forced to choose which side they will take.  It s the Republican party  not the conservatives. Most republicans are so spineless and corrupt that they ll bend over and backstab you to keep their titles and money. I say screw them all  screw Romney  Murkowski  the whole Bush family  Graham  and any other spineless republicans. I m a conservative before a republican  and it s time that all real conservative republicans ditch this party and start a real grassroots movement party.  I second that.  The problem is the people voting. They keep voting in the same idiots that don  39 t do anything productive or useful.  Hank Johnson   dem  After seeing all the shit that went down in 2020  and  em again  em  in the Georgia run offs  I  39 m not sure anyone is actually voting for these people.  I agree 100 . Just on getting stimulus money to people that need they have failed miserably.    I thought that was going to be the tea party  small government pro freedom conservatives. I still wonder occasionally what happened to them. That s the wing of the party I identify with more than establishment Rs  Honestly  They made Sarah Palin one of the leading figures of their movement  and it was a big mistake. She just didn t have the chops  intellectually  personally  or politically  to carry the Tea Party forward and the movement died on her back.     Character assassinated by the leftist news.  What happened to them you ask  They became Trump supporters  the ones that go to those rallies are the same people that were the tea party.  Enjoy handing all power to the democratic party for a generation. Face it  the GOP has you over a barrel. Abandoning them is no different than voting Democrat  because in effect that is what you are doing.   Conservative movement I  39 m not so sure.  Republican party  yeah.  I don  39 t know what you mean by this or how it relates to murkowski.   Trump movement is nationalistic  not conservative. He used the Republican Party as a vehicle  then trashed it into a lake when it didn t serve him any longer. He has set back conservative policy making by decades. Our saving grace is an improved Supreme Court. That s it.  Lol... Tea Party movement  would like to have a word with you. The GOP establishment fucks conservatives not anti establishment outsiders. Ron Paul was a libertarian conservative that used the GOP as a vessel to energize his base  Trump is a populist  nationalist that used the GOP. The last Republican conservative that actually won the presidency was Reagan and then Bush Sr abandoned Reagan conservatism and gave us Clinton and Bush jr. Trump injected new life into the GOP and gave conservatives a platform to fight back. Trump was never a conservative  thatbwas never his contribution to the GOP  your entire point is a strawman.  Nah the choice is between conservatives and Donald Trump versus the Republicans. Unless you think Murkowski is a stalwart conservative.  Not OP  and I have been nervous about saying this on this sub for the past couple of years  but I don t actually think Donald Trump is a conservative.      Trump himself is not conservative  he is still a largely conservative president by almost any standard. I don t agree with your definition of social conservatism  but hey agree to disagree.   deleted   Let her go. Time to primary a lot of these swamp  Republicans   Sarah Palin threated to Primary her in 2022 a few months ago.  Murkowski has lost a primary and won a write in. She  39 s not going anywhere  Palin needs to return to the cause and get it done.  Yeah  more swamp  that  39 s what we need.    I d rather Palin in there than this fraud we currently have.  You  39 d rather have Palin  the person who was running mate with legendary RINO John McCain  than literally any other challenger  No thanks.  She s not perfect but she s better than Murkowski as far as I can tell.  That  39 s not better  that  39 s just different.  If there s someone better who can get it done I d support that person.  Murkowski inherited her seat from her father. She did nothing to earn it.  Plain has supported Trump more often than Murkowski.  As opposed to the supposed non swamp that is proving to be the swamp  such as Cruz and eyepatch guy   Ranked choice top 4 in Alaska  she  39 s good. Murkowski lost her primary in 2010 and won a write in. Literally nothing will take her out  The Republican Party is dead. They can t stand on a message or principles. They tossed Trump under the bus in the end. I for one don t care about Murkowski. She s already gone. And you can t count on her to vote for anything important anyway.  Trump threw himself under the bus.  Voting to  object  to the certification was mathematically impossible from the start  considering that the the Democrats have the majority in the house.    People on here are so fucking short  sighted. Imagine what would happen if the parties were reversed. A Democrat incumbent refuses to concede and demands Congress overturn the election. Analyze the evidence the Trump team has put forth and ask yourself if a Democrat brought that forth  would you support them staying in office  The Trump team hasn  39 t actually claimed voter fraud in court more than a few hundred votes here and there  not nearly enough to overturn the results. By their own admission they aren  39 t even claiming they won in actual fact. They simply want millions of admittedly real votes thrown out on a technicality.   I ve come to realize that a TON of people  left or right  don t actually care about  democracy  as they claim.  It s nothing more than a talking point   they would welcome a monarchy so long as it aligned with their views.  Agreed. It  39 s because everybody thinks in terms of now with no regard for the future. Let  39 s say you have a guy you really like who  39 d make a  em great  em  king. Great. Not unprecedented. What happens when he dies though  What if his kid is a complete moron who drives the country into the ground  No recourse  sorry  you  39 re just gonna have to suffer until he dies. Want to change it before  That takes a high stakes violent revolution.   Just because Trump does Trump doesn t give the R s free reign to abandon. Regardless how you feel about the D s  they stick together. One can condemn Trump and even his words while at the same time maintaining that the Capitol nonsense wasn t his fault  and support impeachment  25th Amendment  or resignation.   Just a lot worse than I thought.  Can Romney and Sasse follow her   As a Nebraska native  fuck Ben Sasse.  She  39 s not a republican  No  but she voted for Republican leadership  which like it or not does matter.   Control of the Senate lies in the majority leader  39 s hands.  that  39 s committee control as well as the legislative agenda.  In a closely split Senate  a Murkowski could decide whether the Republicans get to do anything at all or if only liberal bills get to the floor.  Toodles then.  Probably was just looking for a reason to board the dark star.  We need to shun the RNC.  Let them fall.  We have to rebuild.  We can  39 t keep using the same avenues.  And if anyone thinks that this would just result in total control for Dems forever  there is precedent that shows it might not. When the Republican Party was founded in 1854 with abolition as its primary separating issue from the Whig party  the vote split gave Democrats a 66  majority in both houses and a win in the 1856 presidential election. However  the election of 1860 turned the tide  as Republicans took control of both houses and installed the first Republican President  Abraham Lincoln.   Exactly this. Everyone understands what s going on. It was true then and it is true today. Gut the GOP and create a new party that has a party constitution that does not allow for RINO style players.  She is smart. She knows that most of the spineless republicans who turned their backs on Trump will get torn apart soon by the vicious wolves in the democrat party. She decided to joint the pack.  In other words her personal hatred is so much she  39 s willing to turn the back on the supporters who elected her through a  em write in campaign  em  just to make herself feel better.  Aren t she and Romney the biggest RINOs in the senate  This doesn t really surprise me. But hey  go join the Dems even though they didn t condemn any violent riots over the summer.  Mittens can go with her. They already have the senate for all practical purposes  Ok  bye.  If she wants to join this democrat party  she was never a conservative  Would anyone notice   Fucking why   orange man  perhaps orange man not as bad as you purport   Lisa Murkowski to Alaskans   Fuck you    she has always been a traitor  We needed the two Georgia seats to make the Senate Romney proof  but apparently also Murkowski proof.  That  39 s why the race was doomed to fail   Republicans have lost faith in the party as a whole and it has very little to do with Trump. I don  39 t give a shit at this point  any politician that denounces Trump or supports more status quo bullshit isn  39 t getting vote. They can eat shit. I voted for Bush  McCain and Romney.. never again.  Don t let the door hit you on the way out.  The big question is whether they have 50 votes to take out the filibuster  and it  39 s not clear to me with defections that they do.  Murkowski even as a Dem would be highly unlikely to vote to remove it.  So long as it remains  the difference between 50 democrats and 59 is irrelevant.  Don t they need 60 votes to remove filibuster   No it  39 s basically a taboo that keeps the filibuster in place  minimum is 50 votes to get rid of it but that would be a real escalation  Right the problem with getting rid of it is that if the Right gets in power they would use it against the Left.  See Harry Reids removal of the Filibuster for judicial nominees vs McConnell doing the same for SCOTUS.   If the Republican Party has become nothing more than the party of Trump  I sincerely question whether this is the party for me  she said.    For someone as desperate to hold onto power as she is  not sure what kind of clout or authority shes going to have in a party that sees her years as a Republican as irredeemable complicity.  Nothing would meaningfully change  Leave she is as republican as democrat anyway  Good riddance. Leave now.  Oh no. Anyway  We need a law to prevent this kind of BS. If you were elected under a specific party and want to switch after the elections a new electoral process should be held in place to ensure proper political party representation.  Does she think people are voting for her  They are voting for Republican Party. Trump is the only one who can claim people are voting for him.  Can t fault the woman  the CCP money must feel real good when the Chinese pour it all over you.  Easy to take money when you don t have a soul or moral compass.   deleted   Traitor.  Good riddance. She s a goddamn RINO anyway  and it s not like republicans have the balls to get shit done with the majority as it is. Weakness.  Whether she  officially  leaves or doesn t leave is irrelevant at this point   she votes democrat all the time anyway  and Schumer is already speaker.  It  39 s like switching shirts for these people  so who the fuck even cares.  They  39 ll be expelled anyway so only Democrats will be represented.  She might   Thought she already had.  Ah...another traitor.  What a shocker. She  39 s one of the squishy RINOs anyway. If she goes  no great loss.  What would change if she left gop  Presumably if she really held moderate conservative values she would still reject packing scotus  ending filibuster.
t3_ku8wa3,Amazon Boots Parler Off Web Hosting Service,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku8wa3/amazon_boots_parler_off_web_hosting_service/,Here is a perspective many have overlooked  these purges of conservatives by social media reveals a long overdue truth that conservatives must learn. Republicans cannot expect to campaign and govern via social media when those very platforms are run by people who wish you dead. Just as it was blessedly ruled that the devout are under no obligation to bake cakes for gay patrons  so too do these private companies have the right to deny service to those they oppose.  Colorado v Masterpiece Cakes was a very narrow ruling which exempts artists from being forced to create art that they don t want to.  That is a very different thing.  Sounds a bit like you re saying create a second America.  There are already two Americas  It s certainly headed in that direction.  Or at the very least a second internet. What do conservatives do when ICANN won t issue them IP addresses due to  harmful content    Easy  now create the financial and tech infrastructure to support your platform.   While this is true we still have to do something. Our biggest bargaining chip is our money. We have to start somewhere.  Yes we do  but how do you proceed  Boycotts will not work alone.  Boycotts combined with investing and spending money locally and spending money patronizing business that share common interests in opposing censorship is a good start.  And distribute on what hardware exactly  Do they make their own phones to run the software   Not yet. But the demand may be there and where there  39 s demand  there are always people who are entrepreneurial enough to step in and meet that demand.  Exactly. It s time to stop consuming products from companies that think of you as a piece of trash. What self respecting person would do that  I understand that we don t have as many options today because we are all trapped in a situation of our own making. We trusted these leftists and thought that these are just intellectual differences. Turns out that they don t think of you as their intellectual equivalent.  What needs to happen is people supporting conservative type and owned businesses over the easy route of Amazon and others.  Exactly. We need a Constitution for conservative businesses. For example  no censorship should be one of its rules and any business that breaks it needs to be kicked out of the club.  That baker doesn t own a large share of the baking industry whereas these social media companies in fact own large sections of the social media industry. You re overlooking important facts.  Doesnt change anything. We put ourselves in a reliant position on big tech and now it  39 s coming back to bite us. I  39 ve been social media free for over 10 years. I  39 ve never understood why conservatives support the linkes of FB  Twitter  etc...  I don t use those either. However  this is the purpose of anti trust legislation because some companies will get very big and powerful.  Insane  Guess it s just a matter of time before this sub gets censored too.   No we wont. We don t peddle stop the steal  release the kraken  QAnnon bullshit here.  Ohh my sweet summer child.  Oh ok they  39 ll surely leave us alone then.  You think it matters at all what anyone says here other than  conservative    Moderate apparently means clueless. Like I have said  spread your cheeks and smile  surely they will use lube this time.

The headline alone is a smack in the face of service men and women who have sacrificed for us.  Elections are the embodiment of the Constitution on the tangible and personal level. If the Constitution is now now worthy of personal sacrifice  we have lied to servicemen for decades and the country is truly dead.  The fuck is this Commie bull shit  You are a joke and your paper is a joke.  I mean  considering elections determine almost every aspect of our lives  I d say they re worth sacrificing a lot for  So the freedom to be governed by the people that we choose to put in office is less important than living our day to day life  How can we live our day to day life if those in power put laws in place that take away the life that we enjoy  How can we live our life if those that we duly elect are withheld from being in those positions due to fraud and unconstitutional laws   Paywall.

Britain. Australia. they  39 re all watching.  This has been said so often but nothing seems to happen. What does it matter if we all know  They get away with it and we all just make frown faces and carry on.  Impeachment for dementia.   That will surely stick when Biden won t even remember his own name.  So many are cheering it on though   that s an ominous sign of how badly America is decaying.  She looks more and more like a clown every day. I mean  she legitimately looks like John Wayne Gacy in his clown costume.

Ted Cruz to Resign,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuhcub/major_player_in_texas_politics_calls_on_sen_ted/,Love those clickbait headlines.  So Democrats demand Republican resign.  Shocking.  The Chron is  em not  em  a  quot major player quot . They  39 re a shitrag  and their editorial board is even less useful than that.  LOL  leftists can STFU and fuck off.  I know people have lost their minds over the Capitol Protest and as a result our democracy is in great peril and question right now  but perhaps the citizens of Texas should decide Senator Cruz s fate in 2024 and not the media  I know that s probably a radical suggestion.  How dare Democrats speak of  political opportunism . They have been acting despicably since the events transpired. They are treating this incident in the same way the Nazis treated the Reichstag Fire.   This is Biden s repeat the lie often enough and it becomes the accepted  truth .  Cruz  39 s objection to counting the electoral votes was not because he was convinced there was fraud on a scale large enough to flip the 2020 election but to perform an audit over 10 days to convince Americans that such large scale fraud  em didn  39 t change the election.  em   Exactly   and that tells you everything.  You don  39 t need to memorize every detail of every grievance linked to every state.  You just have to know that they could have easily and conclusively put any doubt to rest   and chose instead to avoid and deter any attempt at any kind of investigation.

I think that will be the biggest casualty of covid.  Because the idiot legislature gave cuomo all the power back in March  It  39 s like freaking darth sidious  Compare this idiot trying to personally dictate a vaccine rollout  the inevitable shit results  and the lack of media coverage  not to mention killing thousands of seniors  to DeSantis in Florida who rolled it out by allowing doctors  hospitals  and health care networks manager it  you know the actual professionals  and in turn he is ambushed by CNN journalists trying to attack this plan.   deleted   Because they don t want covid to go away. It s a perfect excuse to trample people s rights and shut down churches.  Including 2 groups that weren  39 t included in phase 1A would have easily used up this amount of vaccine  those over 75 and ALL health care frontline workers.  This is what gov run healthcare will be like.  a href   r politics  r politics  a   I  39 m a disabled vet and I laugh at anyone who wants public healthcare  they can  39 t even get it right for the small percentage that has served our country.  AMEN. You ever sit in your local VA ER watching another vet writhing in pain  or outright bleeding  you ask the attendant doing crossword puzzles to do something  and it s always that same lady.  SIR SIR  dripping with condescension  we are working on it  literally does fucking nothing  goes back to crossword puzzle.  I know some folks who do a  em lot  em  of EEO law against the VA.  Their admins are downright evil  incompetent rats.  They will destroy the careers of good doctors for their own bureaucratic gain  and they never fire the despicable people who have cost the country millions.  I fucking believe it. The rats that are hired sit there and condescend to you  and treat you like garbage most of the time.   The hospital in Tampa is pretty good in terms of actual care  but ya the admin staff is awful. I don  39 t even bother half the time because I know if I call for anything I  39 m looking at an appointment 3 6 months away.  Same for me  I can  39 t wait six months for care. It  39 s insanity. People who want a free ride on the government have no idea how bad the quality of that ride is going to be.  Being in the military myself I  39 ve long since learned that nobody takes care of me like I take care of me. It  39 s sad for all the people who have  more or less have themselves to rely upon for care down the road because of the ineptitude of government health care. That  39 s why I save 26  of my pay  because who knows what the fuck it  39 s gonna look like in 40 years.  Ya  nothing like waiting 6 months for a simple appointment. I  39 d pay for private insurance of if could afford it. The  quot affordable quot  care act made sure it was unaffordable though.  Good thing trump solved alot of those issues though.  Right... I wish  but doubt it will ever be fixed.  Like every president says...  I was told by a leftist on here that there was no danger of that happening when I warned them.  Some guy told me that national healthcare was free as well  because you dont have to pay at the point of service.  When I pointed out things like doctors and medicine cost money  and have to be paid for through increased taxation  he said it was ok  because everyone could get much more healthcare out of the system than they paid for in tax.  So socialized medicine is like a perpetual motion machine.  And somehow it will be Trump  39 s fault.  Should have gave him more.  s   a href  https   www.google.com amp s amp.statesman.com amp 6567380002  https   www.google.com amp s amp.statesman.com amp 6567380002  a   That s fine but that s not the point here. The problem is cuomo bashing trump for his plan and then suing because he didn t like the responses he got and then turning around a fucking it all up anyways.  Cuomo bashing trump is low hanging political fruit  and to be expected. The issue is government inefficiency and incompetence on both sides of the aisle and failing their citizens.  Yea I know and I m not disagreeing. I m just saying that it s being pointed out because of the circumstances that led up to this. It s not news because of the results here. It s news because of what has been happening regarding the bashing and it absolutely should be called out.  You have to work at being as incompetent as Cuomo. He s fucked to every step of the way re  Covid. And because we live in a world where dunking on Trump is more important than saving lives he s been showered with praise for it.  Still can t believe He has a effing book about how well he did with his response to COVID.  He really is trying to kill everyone in that state isnt he   Ah its okay.  Hes a media darling.  They love him.  You should be prosecuted for this. This is gross negligence honestly.  That boy is a totally and positively incompetent noddy.  Meanwhile in FL  DeSantis has been rolling at the vaccine as quickly as they can to hospitals and put a directive out there to make sure those 65 and older are the first to receive as they are the ones with the highest fatalities.  Free market good.  Government bureaucracy bad.  He wants it to get worse.   Don t give them vaccines if they re going to waste them  What a disgrace  more incompetence...  Holy shit this is ridiculous. There are plenty of people who do want the vaccine and probably cannot access it  and these materials are going to waste. And then this asshole demands more  What kind of fucked up universe are we living in right now.  His job should be on stage not ruling a state. What a    From the start our governments  39  response to the COVID 19 pandemic resembles a bunch of monkeys humping a football.  It ll all be blamed on Trump  Those nursing home patients you killed weren  39 t enough  eh Andrew   And he wants even more vaccines sent to his state...  If they make us get a card proving we got the vaccine  I know a guy  just saying....  He is such a pathetic loser  Can we arrest him   You  39 re telling me he let 66  of doses he was sent expire because of his phased plan.  The same crime of a Wisconsin pharmacist  but on a much larger scale.    Throw that shit in the gutter lol you  39 re an idiot or a brainwashed fool to take a rushed and experimental vaccine that doesn  39 t even prevent transmission. Why would anyone trust the pharmaceutical industry to make a safe and effective product when they can  39 t be held liable for damages

At least Tom was an actual friend.    Woodstock 2021.  Turn their own language against them.  It doesn  39 t matter when no one cares. They know this. The left is just running in circles to defeat their enemy. Integrity is a lot harder to master than virtue signaling.  It s the beginning of the end. Same thing happened in Cuba when Castro and his party controlled the radios and no one else s opinions could be heard.  I can t stand Twitter it s a giant anti Trump circlejerk it just annoys me to my core.  Unsure if I can comment on this. As a liberal  left leaning Brit  fairly sure I d vote Democrat across the board  I agree the Twitter management of this is slightly concerning  Ah  that uniquely British talent for understatement.  We re being gaslighted by not only social media and the MSM but now the president and vice president elect  I already get down voted more on this sub than on any other.  And except for a few brave redditors  there is little discussion left here either.  Just occasional conservative posts with 100 responses saying that biden is super awesome and we should hail the new socialism.  Biden is the most centrist milktoast option they could give you to appeal to middle ground people. Why the fuck do people keep calling him socialist. He can  39 t even see the end of his own nose past all the crime bills  blue dog war mongering and corporate funding. Socialism my fucking ass.  People worry he has dementia and is controlled by others.  That  39 s because he does and he is.  Have you read literally any of his policy. Such as in the first 100 days giving citizenship to 11 million illegal immigrants. His hard stance on guns wearing to ban all online sale of guns ammunition and attachments. His literally coalition with bernie to overhaul healthcare. His talks about free college. His want to re implement transpacific trade agreement that was to far left for even Bernie sanders. Should i go on. The man aint even close to moderate and there were others in the democratic party that are far more moderate than him  such as Tulsi Gabbard seemingly the only principled democrat that ran this election  and even she isnt very moderate.  Biden is an idiot with no self awareness or principles except for lust for power.  Grew up in Delaware with him as my senator.  He is not a socialist  but will 100  do whatever the socialists tell him to do.  I m not having children. Not giving leftists 1 more human to indoctrinate into thinking giving up everything to people who have grievances against them will bring them happiness. The left can rot out its base.  The day this sub dies  is the day I lose one of the only place where I can actually talk to others about my political view.  Find people you like add them on discord and just chat.  What s the first thing a dictator does  Media blackout. People s Republic of America. In 3 or 4 year this comment will put me in jail.  It  39 s also worth noting that 50 years ago  some on the Left busied themselves with bombmaking and assassination attempts.  The Weather Underground is still being promoted as heroic by the left to this day. They bombed the Capitol building.  One of their kids is the District Attorney for San Francisco.  This is the future  generation z will have to deal with the United States becoming more authoritarian and left wing. The only thing we can do is set an example for our kids  and hope the next generations fix the issues that are coming.  As someone who leans left  I peruse this subreddit specifically for these reasons. Feeding off one side leaves people uncultured and unwilling to find middle ground. I like to keep in check by seeing both sides and trying to find my own opinion. I know many people who feel this way but unfortunately extremists on both sides have made things hard     Only one side has the power to ban people and deplatform.  Hell even KommieHarris approved endorsed their antics  rioting ...   The smile on her face as she gleefully declared this terrifies me.

I can t believe that s the quote. He only said positive things. Wtf. I m just floored. How the fuck does this get the president banned    I thought Trump got removed from Twitter for inciting the violence  Is that his full tweet   He also posted a video calling for people to be peaceful and to go home.  Fucking A. I can t believe that s the quote. He only said positive things. Wtf.  Trump Derangement Syndrome.  Yes this tweet got him removed for inciting violence.  It  39 s tricky when you think 2   2   5  It s actually 22. Prove me wrong  There was zero inciting violence in his speech. I think what got him removed was suggesting that the election was stolen  But I may be wrong. I do know that I listened to his speech and there was nothing remotely deserving of a ban  even by their standards. But now they know that Dems control all aspects of government and social media  so there  39 s no fallback for doing what they want. Its free game on conservatives now. Every day that I  39 m not in jail for being conservative is a blessing.  Yeah  my understanding of the  quot rule violating quot  tweets is that he said the election was stolen amidst all the pleas to be civil and go home.  Praised his supporters.  The praise and the stolen election lines were concluded to be inciting violence.   Do we know how many people have died from the BLM  protests   I m sure plenty.   Jack Dorsey is a piece of shit.  Yes.  Also yahoo headline brags that hillary is trolling trump about twitter.... which just proves yet again the dems don  39 t care whatsoever about the capitol situation. They just care about childishly trolling trump and making up nonsense that he caused it.  The left are hypocrites  but do not care.  There were a lot of tweets about the riots that happened  Twitter isn t going to do anything about the tweets of the people who made them.  Anyone who  39 s not a brainwashed sheep is aware of the incredible hypocrisy on display here. This is par for the course for the Liberal media and politicians.  But they would never see it  They don t even want to consider the right be it moderately right or centred as anyone but a bigot. That s exactly how they get people to walk away from the bs  This is just blatant hypocrisy on twitters part. They need to ban anyone regardless of who they are if they incite violence  etc. same goes for Muslim extremists  alt right  leftists  CCP  be straight across the board when giving out the ban hammer. Just makes sense  There exists a plurality of American voters who are irreperably and happily corrupted by the poison of progressivism. You cannot debate with these people and you most certainly should not respect them as your  quot fellow quot  countrymen. A reckoning is needed regarding the complicity of both the conservatives and liberals in allowing this scourge to enter the mainstream and it is long overdue  You can t respect people that don t respect themselves.  I  member     I also like how they all of a sudden like the police after they have been saying defund they police for the last couple of months. They are so worried about the police that got killed now because it helps their narrative. When the LA police officers got shot out here in LA all they would post on politics was about that damn reporter and nothing about the actual cops that got shot in cold blood. I can t even blame them tho  when you have all of social media and the news telling you what to think you can t expect anything less.  Jack Dorsey  among other countless morons  does this hoping one day celebrity minorities will say  quot Oh look  he  39 s one of the good white people. quot    Edit  liberal minorities.  I stand corrected.......and in solidarity with folks like you.  As a minority I can 100  agree with what you ve said. Not all  but a huge group of leftist minorities will never be happy.  That feels racist...   removed   The rioting and arson by BLM and Antifa in Seattle has gone on nightly for MONTHS.  Mainstream and major social media are the propaganda wing of the Democratic Party  so they will ignore suppress any negative news regarding left wing violence and amplify any regarding right wing violence. We  39 ve known this was the case for a long time  that any right wing response was going to be met with non stop news and would give the left the  quot right quot  to become even more authoritarian. They wanted to trigger a right wing violent response over the summer  to be juxtaposed against the  quot virtuous quot  BLM marches   but it never really materialized in any large scale way.  Master Jack DOES live in a strange  strange world.  Lmao. And this one is active calls for violence  it isnt just twisting words and assuming what they say like the left does  Love when people praise Floyd  dude was a piece of shit. Violent criminal  not some hero to look up to.  But they are always going to believe they are on the right side of history.  Yea the left loves to reward violence  as long as its in support of their cause.  Rules for thee not for me  Yeah but Trump saying stop the violence is definitely inciting violence

I don  39 t have the time nor the energy to argue about the obvious purge of conservatism from liberal media  but this specifically refers to TRUMP named and themed subs.  Sure thing snowflake. Lick that boot harder.  We will all be found guilty of  wrong think   inabsentia  very soon.   THEY KNOW WHERE I LIVE. COME AND FIND ME.
t3_kudtog,Biden Says He Will Defeat the NRA While in Office,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kudtog/biden_says_he_will_defeat_the_nra_while_in_office/,Accused rapist vows to disarm women.  Meaning the end of the 2nd amendment. And I believe it will happen.  It s only the end of the second amendment if people actually give back their guns.   The good thing is I can only imagine how many guns are floating around that never had ownership transferred after being sold private party. I know there s a BUNCH of them out there. Good luck fed bois.  I hope your not forced to find them...   Sorry  covid20 mutation. Too dangerous for me to come in with my guns  just do universal mail in license applications. I m sure everyone will be honest.  As did I  the wreck is undivable out in lake notyers  Well they are cutting off ways for conservatives to communicate and organize now.   Were you preparing for Normandie   They re already trying to pass laws that install registries for gun and ammo purchases with mandatory waiting periods for but guns or ammo.  Manchin won t vote for this shit  Im under the suspicion that 90  of the Republicans in Washington are RINOs.  They are going to come for your guns and as soon as someone physically pushes back the Republicans will come out and say  quot this is not who we are quot  and endorse taking your guns away. As far as I  39 m concerned these people cannot be relied on. A few yes  but the majority  no.  January 20th is a cold shower moment.  The whole Capitol thing was a setup. They tried to create a huge scene  but when it didn  39 t go the way they wanted they still pushed the narrative like it was a massive uprising.  I saw the videos of police officers opening the Capitol doors.  I  39 ve been reading a lot of viewpoints and you  39 re spot on. Have you seen the video of the shooting as a staged scene  At first I thought it was someone who did something stupid  but honestly it does look almost perfectly staged.  Thanks. I dont want to be spot on but I just cannot help it.  Haha the business end maybe  You mean like this   No thats a start...   is that before or after he cures cancer   Didn  39 t know the NRA was competing for office.  He  39 ll have to beat the NRA to it.  Bahaha most under rated comment of the day.  His efforts would be better spent defeating our illegal gun issue which has been terrorizing blue states.  Quick  everyone just started calling the nra an idea and he won  39 t do shit  Well... time to donate some more money to the NRA and other 2A groups   And while Biden is distracting us with this  he will be selling out America to China.  Fisting is illegal in some states...  Yes  we know China Biden hates the constitution if it doesn  39 t get him 10  of the bribes.  Text   That  39 s funny considering most of the violent gun crime is committed by BLM types and others in the black community. Likewise  illegal immigrant crime is also highly dependent on stolen firearms.    strong Whatever happened to just firing a shotgun out the back door   strong   The NRA better move out of NY and quit banking with Wells Fargo if they want a hope of survival.   removed   Not with the current Supreme Court  They  39 re packing the courts chief. SCOTUS cannot save you.  Do you actually think they ll actually pack  I don t think it ll end up happening.  Biden has already said he will set up a council for 180 days to bring him recommendations on restructuring the SC. Remember for a moment that the common belief among the left is that Trump packed the SC already so adding judges to  quot balance quot  the court would actually be  quot unpacking the court. quot  It is going to happen. At the very least  it will be strongly attempted. They have until 2022 at least without the right having a real say about it.  He also said he wasn t a fan of court packing and didn t want to turn the Supreme Court into political football. I m not defending Biden or anything. I want the SC to stay conservative more than anything  but I just don t see him doing something so radical. Even if Biden was on board  they would need the votes in the Senate as well.  51 votes  which I think they have after GA.  50   VP

Alright. Good for him. End of his career anyway may as well go out attending an inauguration.  I hear there s a nice lunch afterwards.  No no don t. Pence is done with politics after this anyway  Agree... and it sucks because I was looking forward for Pence in 2024...   Desantis 2024  Love Desantis but he needs to serve two terms as governor before he s ready for the national stage.  Trump had no govt experience and Obama was a jr senator. Why 2 terms  More time to get mired in the swamp. He s ready now.  Obama was a shit president and trump has a lifetime in the private sector  the two aren t comparable.  By the way he  39 s leading Florida through the pandemic and how he talks to the press  I  39 d say he  39 s ready now.  I agree  he ll be ready in 2024.  Exactly. Desantis reacts to the media like they are they are a pesky fly. He ll swat at them but at the end of the day they are nothing to him and he has bigger fish to fry. Trump was embarrassingly thin skinned around the media and the media freaking loved it.  He d be in his second term by 24   deleted   Love her but she needs to run for local office Congress first. Would love to see her on a national level but I think that s a few more years away.  ME TOO.

Do you know how much more some of these people can take before they see it  cause I don  39 t know anymore. I thought lockdowns  riots all year long  a questionable election  and most of the other stuff that happened last year might wake some people up  but I guess not.  I fear you  39 re right and they  39 ll even have a harder time now  Dems control every level of government  control every single politician that was to hold their career  control bigtech  control hollywood and control the narrative.  Nah  fuck that guy.  They come for the guns next  Already are. Newly proposed bills to require a gun license for firearm purchases as well as ammunition purchases. Further  they proposed bills to require a gun registry.  Logic like this is why we re in the situation we re in.   BINGO. And I m probably the outlier here and considered a  conspiracy theorist   but I don t believe Biden is going to be sworn in. I really believe it s going to military tribunals...and then  four more years.  That is conspiracy  big time. Biden will be sworn in  the question then becomes how long until Kamala becomes president afterwards.   Lol  as I already stated  it s an unpopular opinion. I happen to think you re wrong. Never in my 39 years of life have I ever been a conspiracist. But look at where we are at now...who  in their right mind  would have believed all that s happening now    Pence has always been the model politician for behaviour to balance out Trump.  Swamp loves the swamp  He shouldn  39 t bother. It  39 s a big sham anyway and the Democrats are proving in spades that they can  39 t and won  39 t live in the same country with conservatives.  Hes just trying to save face. He knows his career is over  What a loser. Never voting for him  Of course he will. The man is a snake  thinking only of his own 2024 run. We must remember when he is part of the primary in a few years.  It  39 s virtual   Biden fixed the corona virus  So he can witness the arrests.  What planet do you live on

But NJ hates those who follow the law.  Fellow NJ resident here.  NJ gun laws are absolutely draconian.  It s sad that we are so close to PA that actually allows their residents to exercise their constitutionally protected rights.  NJ is a trash heap in so many ways.  It s becoming unlivable.  I have a feeling that PA will face some more restrictions in the near future as well. Just a feeling  This is still some typical  rules for thee  bullshit. If you or I tried to carry a gun in DC  we d still be arrested for it.

Democrats with power are going to use that power to silence the voices of opposition. The msm is already in their pocket and will justify this theft of free speech. What other freedoms do they intend to rob us of in our best interest  of course.  s  It s just more of the same.  All the  Tech Giants  just want a giant echo chamber to scream their leftist wackjob beliefs into.  No decent  no other opinions  no speech unless it s the  right kind  of speech.  I hope their companies and profits wither and die.  I hope new businesses rise and put them out.  Really  I hope their 230 protections get yanked.  There is no point in them having it at this point.  Amazon sucks now anyway. They are slow on deliveries  half their products are wrong missing when delivered  and their customer service absolutely sucks. They act like nothing is their problem. We need to focus on American products regardless if they cost more to purchase. We need to break away  from everything that is China.  I ll say that Amazon sucks as executives  but I think you re wrong about everything else. There s a reason they dominate their market...  Maybe i just kept getting the short end of the stick. I quit using them 6 months ago. Anything i need or want  i search for a product that is made in the U.S.A. Yes  they have dominated their market  but we might want to start changing that.

Says the guy who made up News to degrade GWB.  I didn  39 t know that Mr. Fake News still lived.  This is one of the things about people that blows my mind and it  39 s prevalent in this interview.

t3_ku7tns,Seven out of 10 Trump voters OPPOSED storming of the US Capitol by MAGA mob  but they still want the president to finish out his term and not be impeached survey finds,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku7tns/seven_out_of_10_trump_voters_opposed_storming_of/,What the left isn t admitting   99.999  of Trump voters had nothing to do with the capitol building protest.  say 100   out of 75 million    0.99999866   99.999866  None. I understand being upset with our elected officials but quite frankly those who got violent and breached the capital are not welcome in conservative communities.  They are not.  Instill don  39 t see where Trump can be blamed for what happened.  And I  39 m pissed off that the GOP isn  39 t standing up for him.  Nothing in his speech said go storm the Capitol.  I  39 ve read and heard actual dangerous rhetoric from Dems and our media.  If anything I blame Rudy for stoking the fire more when he straight up said trial by combat like WTF Rudy could you have picked a worse choice of words  If you put on your tinfoil hat the  quot riot quot  seems like a setup. The cops just move out of the way and let all the protestors in to the building. The cops even seem to be encouraging the protestors at times.   Woah man where s the overblown hyperbole like the media what you to believe   It would be like wasting a huge amount of tax dollars to try to fire the guy who  39 s got less then 2 weeks left... and it will amount to nothing in the end this time as well.  I think the idea is to get it through the House now  and convict him in the Senate after the new Senate starts. This would make Trump ineligible to hold federal office.  This shows exactly why the democrats should not have control right now. When your motivation is vengeance not logic and reason no good will come of it.  This has been the past 4 years and they re not even in power  it s going to get worst. They hate Trump more than they care about their constituents.  Trump tried to drain the swamp  and now the swamp is trying to punish him for it. That  39 s what this gas always been.  I like that term   39 gas  39   In 2022 I am only voting for a rep who will promise to impeach biden once a month  I m angry at Georgia Republicans. I know they were angry at GOP  but look at what Dems are doing after they also got senate. It might be the end of our democracy.  It doesn  39 t really matter what you do  say  or believe. Currently  the radical left is just frothing at the mouth to destroy  em everyone  em  who isn  39 t affiliated with them.  Their own hatred will be their destruction.  a few dozen kranks doing what the vast majority did not.  I feel like those seven will change their mind once they realize what congress just did.  Will anything come of this though  Sure fucking hope so  Those 7 don  39 t understand what is at stake at the moment.  I definitely strongly opposed it at first  but the way that the Republican Party and Big Tech democrats have been acting ever since  I m frankly dissapointed it wasn t bigger  Correction

But the tech firms double standards are absurd.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ktt8q3/why_is_twitter_censoring_trump_but_not_the_ccp_no/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  rel  nofollow  https   discord.gg conservative  a   The leader of Iran  a terrorist country  has been calling for violence to Americans for months. And he still has a Twitter account but DJT  a sitting President  does not.   He literally tweeted for the elimination of Israel a few months ago.  Twitter still allows Dr. Mahathir Mohamad to post  even though he once posted   iTs JuSt SaBeR RaTtLiNg  I guess he  39 s still mad about the Battle of Tours.  It sounds like the problem isn  39 t that Trump was censored  it  39 s that these other accounts aren  39 t censored. Just like you can  39 t go on TV and call for your supporters to kill people  you shouldn  39 t be able to incite violence via social media. No matter who you are.   The problem is the inconsistent way in which the rules are applied. It  39 s obvious the rules only apply to conservatives  so conservatives should in turn vote with our pocketbooks  so to speak  and not use their site. Hitting these companies financially is the only way to they  39 ll change.  Now you see how we feel about the criminal justice system  Just speaking logically and not emotionally  I would be interested to see what would happen if conservatives left Twitter in large numbers. Twitter makes money from advertisements  so the only way that would cause the company to take a hit is if other companies who targeted conservative users stopped selling ads on Twitter. I almost never see those types of ads on Twitter.  Precisely my point. Fewer daily active users results in lower ad prices results in lower stock price. Simple as that.  Well  no... it results in less ad revenue.  Prices could easily remain the same.  Yes  that might lower the stock prices.  Ads can be targeted. I have my suspicions that there are orders of magnitude less conservative ads on those platforms than other types of ads  but even if they exist  the algorithm may determine a better one for you. Hard to say.  Considering Facebook has been losing people in droves for years now  I don t think it will work  and besides  conservatives needed the electoral college votes to get Donald Trump elected in 2016. Had it been only popular votes  he would have lost in 2016. Conservatives don t have the numbers to vastly change how a social media company decides who and when someone is banned.  Let them eat gay cake   No it s the opposite   none of them should be censored.  It  39 s a service  not a product   and a free one  no less.  When the terms are updated  you  39 re free to leave. If you want to control that  you need to buy Twitter or vote to regulate it.  I think we passed the era of being able to tell your supoorters to be violent against certain other people with the death of Hitler.   I think you re technically correct but from an ethics and practices point of view  I think it s a slippery slope. I m not sure how much you know about the actual intellectual implications of publisher vs platform but it does matter in terms of legal liability and also just in terms of business ethics.  You are complaining about the fact that all censorship should be prevented on a subreddit that regularly only allows flaired users to comment on major events  and deletes any unflaired users comments  or even comments that are reasonable but not conservative.  The one that get me is conservative members opions which criticise trump being banned  I actually minored in Journalism in college  but I  39 ll admit its been a while. But Twitter is recognized as a social platform legally  and not as a publishing company so I don  39 t see how they would have to abide by the same rules you  39 d see in publishing.   So  you bought into the idea the media made up that Trump incited violence     The guy held a rally spouting baseless claims of a stolen election conspiracy  and told them that   quot WE quot   are going to march to the capitol and  quot take back our country quot .  It  39 s a perfect example of  quot Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest  quot     Saying you should march on the capital isn  39 t inciting violence in my opinion  Neither is  quot taking back your country quot . These are common political phrases.   quot Hey I only told Pauly to  quot take care of him quot  I never said to kill him quot  seriously this is the logic you present.   quot We have someone in there who should not be in there and our country will be destroyed and we  39 re not going to stand for that. quot   What about Rudy s  trial by combat  remark at the rally    Iraq calls on the U.S. regime to respect the principles of democracy  or it will intervene militarily to bring down the dictator   said Mustafa Habib  a well known Iraqi analyst and researcher  in a tweet that mocked Washington s actions abroad.  Twitter is a fucking cesspool.  Absolutely terrifying  and the justification of removal of free speech from adversaries on the left side of aisle is just sad. Saying Trump called for violence by telling people to go home and be peaceful is about as hilarious as it comes. Meanwhile the BLM riots were praised for months and cities allowed sections to be annexed to CHAZ and CHOP where people died without consequence. Hard to feel like this isn  39 t outright war.  Just in their own backyard  they  39 ve allowed  The obvious difference is that Iran didn t attack congress while they were trying to certify national election results. I don t mean that to sound as snarky as it does  but there is a difference here.  This. You ignore why he was banned. Then equate it to others  surprising that you pick tyrants and authoritarians  who have boasted and lied  but not led to the invasion of our capital to illegally change a vote you don  39 t like  and can  39 t prove is illegitimate.  The left is petitioning to label proud boys as a terrorist group but won  39 t acknowledge the haneous shit and actual terrorism antifa is responsible for  This is so wrong.  This is another reason why I ve deleted all social media except Reddit and parler.  Your life does change for the better.  I have already deleted FB but the problem is  this is what the left wants. Since conservatives are constantly assaulted  the pretty normal thing to do is to just stop being politically active and voicing your opinions and stop talking about your beliefs. Then the conservative movement dies further and one day if anyone so much as says something conservative  it  39 s treated as a hate crime. Basically half the country are 2nd class citizens  I just deleted Facebook. I do feel better.  Nobody has ever deleted FB and later regretted it  What about a private businesses right to refuse service to anyone  I thought we all loved that  especially when it came to denying a gay couple a wedding cake. Why the sudden change   Get ready folks  it  39 s just going to get worse.  The republicans don  39 t have control of anything and I am starting to believe they are lining their pockets with corrupt money like everyone else in DC  because most are not doing shit for the people that voted for them.  Starting to believe  R vs D at the federal level has been a convenient illusion for a long time now  Yes sir  welcome to the Divided State of America.  DSA  hmmmm. Who else uses that acronym now   I don  39 t think political party has much to do with whether the politicians are lining their pockets  because most of them are.  In regard to the question posed by the headline  we need to understand the motive  and we still have not done so. Absurdity is not the point. This is not merely an oversight. The culture is governed more and more by the left  and is becoming more and more radical each year. Corporate America is now dependent upon China for survival. The sooner we acknowledge that  the sooner we can come together and address the problem.  Twitter was very clear the reason for ban is the messaging Trump is sending to his radical base to stoke further violence  particularly at the inauguration.  Right     Yep  just stopping thru to check it out. Conservatives are still loons even after the terrorist attack. Unfreakingreal.

It only hurts yourself.  You act like it  39 s just the left that is a problem. This sub reddit touts phrases like  quot no taxation without representation quot   but have spent the last 4 years ignoring half of the country. You like to use the constitution against people rather than FOR people.  Over the past few months I ve been watching old home movies from the 80 s and the 90 s.  You could tell how much better and civil life was back then.  The social media age is literally destroying the country.  I would have never imagined it happening 20 years ago  20 years ago you could speak your mind. Now you can  39 t.  20 years ago speaking your mind was too a small group of people. Not the world through social media  I would add speak your mind in a dehumanizing way.  You still can. Just not on private websites who have make their own rules  Private websites who are supposed to be platforms  not publishers.  The same people saying it  39 s bullshit were the same saying you can refuse gay people if you want because you  39 re a private business. Refusal for thee but not for me  and people I like .  I  39 m not saying it  39 s right. I  39 m just saying that these sites have make their own rules and have nothing to do with free speech  I m genuinely curious what is in your mind that you can t speak out about now vs 20 years ago.  How can you not speak your mind in a way that you could in the past   What do you mean   Oh right.  So what are you doing right now   Speaking someone else  39 s mind   And you still got knocked out if you spoke your piece to the wrong people. So I dont know what your point is   Exactly  What  39 s an upvote button you dumbass  If you re on one side of the isle and speak your mind  you get congratulated  if you re on the other and speak your mind  you get lynched. Guess which side gets lynched.  A big difference between 20 years ago and now is that there were no nationally violent events that got in the way of a democratic process. There s a difference between speaking your mind and doing so with the intention of destabilizing the foundations of our democracy.  No  but 30 years ago  a president was nearly killed by a deranged man with a gun  So  like BLM or Antifa when they burned down buildings  destroyed private businesses  murdered innocent people and took over police precincts and set up their own temporary   39 country  39 . Yeah  I agree.  The far between violent actions of BLM  I won t admit to knowing a lot about Antifa  should also be condemned. And social media has done a great job of reeling in content that directly instigated any such violence in the same manner that Trump directly instigated the Capitol s events.  You still can. Social media companies just don  39 t want it happening on their site. You can still speak your mind the same way you would 20 years ago   by phone or in person.  Not in person. When you speak your mind at work  you  39 re quite likely to lose your job.  Could you give an example   You can speak your mind  but twitter is a private company. Why do people keep forgetting this.  It  39 s a platform  like the phone. At least that  39 s what they say. But  if you have an opinion they don  39 t like  you get cancelled.  I mean if they are private they can do what they want  twitter isnt a nyc public park.  NYC public parks are where Conservatives will need to meet soon.  How  39 s that worse than 20 years ago  before Twitter even existed   Not if you were gay. Or black.  exactly. The   39 good old days  39  view of the past is CLEARLY from a straight white male perspective. If you lived outside that norm things are OBJECTIVELY not better in the past.  It  39 s not just social media  this has been ongoing for the last couple decades in the West. If you looked at immigration polls in the 70s or views on gay marriage even among leftists in the 90s in the UK  you  39 d think it was a completely different country to the one it is currently.  Yep  watched All The Right Moves last night no politics just a movie  about football and middle class working Americans.  This. The constant barrage of  information  has led a generation of children to believe nearly everything they see. No questions asked  because optics are more important than the truth. And since it is so easily controlled by a small group of people  there is no dissenting opinions.  Uh  only if you were white back then. The 80 s and 90 s were a horrible time if you weren t white  More like problems are more visible now and people don  39 t like to see truly fucked up our world is. Ignorance is bliss I guess  but I can see how it seems like   39 the good old days  39  if you  39 re a white straight male.  Speaking of double standards  how bout this sub  39 s   39 flaired user only  39  rules  Seems pretty hypocritical to be angry about not letting certain people post on a public platform  while also not letting other certain people post on your public platform. I  39 m sure you have reasons for it  but the fact that these same reasons apply in both cases just adds to the hypocrisy.  You make a decent point but flair is a temporary measure to tackle brigading. When the election hysteria settled it would open back up to everyone  is my understanding anyway .  That also means that this temporary measure is taken at a time when activity on political subs is the highest and the   39 flair only  39  rule is dropped when non conservatives are less likely to engage in  civil  conservative topics.  Shh  you  39 re blowing holes through the narrative. Lefties bad  righties good.  Or how about Iranian leaders calling for the genocide of Jews  Twitter says that is ok because. Is just  political commentary  and  saber rattling .  Cake business   quot I don  39 t want to serve gay couples or publish gay marriage frosting sentiments on my cake because it violates our values.  quot   The thing is most of the people who were banned were mainstream conservatives in new media and conservative journalists.  Exactly. It sounds like there  39 s going to be two parallel internet worlds and I fear it is going to polarize everyone even more if we can  39 t even exist in each other  39 s universe.  Maybe creating new space is not totally bad. More options. More competition.    I brought this up last night on  a href   r news  r news  a  and the leftist  clowns were defending the CCP saying what Trump has done is far worse than anything the CCP has done.  TIL Trump has done worse than putting religious minority citizens in prison camps and using them for slave labor.  Don  39 t forget the forced abortions and harvesting of organs   We should assign China to head the human rights commission for the UN   I really hate the guy but that is just straight up dumb.  Dude you  39 re such a victim wannabe. Plenty of people upvoted your comment.   Ok I  39 ve got to do this to illustrate a point here  probably at the cost of a heap of internet points but oh well.  They banned him for  inciting violence  becuase weeks ago he supported people s right to peacefully protest. Meanwhile  BLM leaders and prominent Dems directly told people to riot and get violent in the summer riots of 2020 and apparently that s acceptable speech     Well it  39 s like what de Blasio said   quot you can only protest for BLM quot . Keep in mind this was when people were protesting the lockdown.  Democrats literally paid bail for violent rioters.  And Kyle Rittenhouse  a mass shooter  raised nearly a million dollars in donations for his legal defense fund.  Right  give me a source on that. What prominent Democrat told them to riot  What BLM leader did so  You want free speech  leave  a href   r Conservative  r Conservative  a . Anytime a reasonable argument is given against any of their mostly absurd comments  you will be banned. Peaceful protests with some rioting and looting  against 400 years of systemic and institutional racism  does not equal a terrorist attack on the US Capitol which was immediately preceded by the president  39 s speech which was full of lies and designed to incite his followers  just as his Twitter account has been full of lies. Twitter had every right to ban him. He has been breaking their rules for years.    quot There needs to be unrest in the streets quot    some African American Congress woman  So was it okay for them to say that  Or was it bad   Lol did you see his response to blm protests    Where have you been   Those guys in dc got treated like spoiled children in comparison.  You are fooling yourself.  Which  prominent Dems directly told people to  strong riot  strong  and  strong get violent  strong      Since when were protests supposed to be peaceful     CNN s Chris Cuomo  in response to conservatives complaining about wonton left wing violence.  Cuomo is a tv opinion host  like Tucker Carlson  who says and does stupid shit all the time.   I  39 m not trying to be antagonistic  I  39 m just genuinely curious. I don  39 t agree with all the destruction of the protests last year but I agree with the message. I  39 m curious as to why most conservatives were not there marching with them  To me  the ability of the state to oppress and kill its citizens with impunity seems like it would be a conservative rallying point. It  39 s very confusing to me.  That  39 s because Twitter and CCP are friends.   Why does one terror inciter have a Twitter and the other doesn t    Jesus Christ Reddit  Funny coming from a sub that specializes in  flaired users only  posts  Then open up all posts on this sub. I can  39 t comment on most of them because I  39 m not a Conservative. Seems kinda hypocritical to whine about Twitter but do the same thing here.  Tyranny by corporations is worse than tyranny by government. No accountability  big tech could ruin you  from credit cards to job searches. We are hanging on the end of a cliff. Hindsight Georgia was the flight 93 election. The Biden presidency hasn t even started yet and already these zealots and tyrants feel comfortable. If we ever gain power again we need to pass 230 reform  individual states need to pass 230 reform and take it to the supreme court  We need individual states to do a lot more than 230 reform. We need to have the states step up and call for amendments to halt federal government overreach at this point. Term limits is one that comes to mind.  Yes  and limiting bills to two pages  Or  rather than limiting it by page  limit it by subject. A general budget bill should be the only type that addresses multiple things that I can think of. Other bills should address only one item so there s no threat of pork.   Either way you d gain an understanding of what your Congress person voted for  That doesn t seem like a conservative opinion to me. I thought the only real tyranny could be at the hand of the government and a corporation is subject to the market. Just trying to understand. Most posts around here are flaired only.  All things said and done Twitter is a business and can refuse service to anyone including trump. They  39 re not censoring him. They just won  39 t allow him to use their platform. If he wants to say anything to his base he can hold a rally or get on a megaphone. No one is stopping him.  Because they re cowards who fear opposing views  Ironic to say on a forum that pulls and blocks users with opposing views.  Where  quot opposing views quot     quot literally trying to overthrow the government quot .  Nice of you to say this in one of the 3  a href   r conservative   r conservative  a  threads that are not   39 flaired users only  39   This goes far beyond opposing views. The sitting president was involved in the attack on our nations capitol  and has been repeating false claims for months to rial people up with no evidence that has made it through any court system. Either his lawyers are terrible at their job  or they simply don t have enough evidence.  I mean you have to admit that  39 s ironic on a forum that verifies that people agree with your views before they  39 re allowed to comment on almost anything.  This  They aren  39 t censoring Trump. They banned him from the platform for violation of their terms of use. They both should he banned. Twitter isn  39 t the battlefield for free speech. It  39 s a platform that these people have willingly agreed to adhere to the terms of use and are subject to be removed from the platform should they violate the terms.   No one should be censored. On a sub that has a   39 flaired users only  39  policy.  The party of deregulation just experienced the consequences of deregulation. They  39 re free to do business how they like  America baby   This is a very true.  I  39 ll say upfront  I  39 m on the left. I do come here to read up on both sides.  Yall know that reddit is a company that can decide what is allowed on their platform right   1    It s not just the tech firms whose double standards are absurd  it is us.   I am against the endless wars  and I usually think war is wrong   propagated by some elite rich old men for business ideology reasons and letting the young men die for it. But today  39 s climate and censorship illustrates how wars are often inevitable. These people push and push until you  39 re entire way of life  your beliefs  your freedom and your livelihood are gone. These liberal fascists have nobody to blame when another civil war inevitably erupts   whether it  39 s the near future or further away  It s literally the republicans who made this  censorship  possible. All of you conservatives were crying about how you didn t want to have to give CAKE to gay people and how businesses should be able to choose who they serve. You all got what you wanted.  I think the reasoning for this  and it makes sense to me  is that indirect calls to violence from leaders of other countries aren  39 t likely to have much of an effect on the US  when did you last see a large pro Iran protest    whereas the president  39 s are. It  39 s a question of practice rather than principle  the president really did incite real violence that actually happened and could do so again.  But isn  39 t twitter a private company that can do whatever they want  Free market baby  At least you dum dums didn  39 t make this a  strong flaired users only  strong  post  Stop expecting leftism to make sense.       Hilarious for a sub that  um   em moderates  em  the conversation via  em Flaired Users Only  em  tags to complain about removing  del dissenting  del  violent voices.  Seriously.  If deplatforming someone from a private forum is a violation of their rights  then this very subreddit is violating all of our rights in 90  of their threads.  Don  39 t worry  they  39 ll be flairing this sub soon enough so they can cry about censorship and the first amendment without any disagreement.  Blame the bigots that didn  39 t bake the cake  Just think of Trump as a gay wedding cake and Twitter as a Christian bakery  then it makes sense.  It  39 s to show us who is really in charge. Twitter backs the CCP.  So it s either let Trump say whatever he wants  make falsie claims all day long and offer no proof at all or be supportive of CCP   Twitter is a private company with rules  Trump broke those rules numerous times and Twitter is fully within their rights to punish him as they say fit. The First Amendment protects from the government silencing critics  not businesses following their own rules.  Private. Company.  Where  39 s my good comrade Bernie saying we need to break up big tech now   Did he stop saying it   So you agree now   He  39 s saying it in between comments about impeaching trump.   Businesses should be able to refuse business to anyone  on their own terms      but not like that    em shocked pikachu face  em   I don  39 t like all this bitching about   39 the other side  39   or the left leaning liberal media social media  I thought Conservatives were supposed to be the main driving force behind the economy and industry  It all just comes off as jealousy and bitching about what   39 the other side have created  39    I have said it before  if you don  39 t like Twitter  or their policies   or Facebook  or YouTube  or whatever  build your own fucking alternatives  instead of just whining and complaining about how the other side holds all the cards and because you don  39 t like the way they choose to run their companies  If conservatism is the natural ally of business and industry  where are all the fucking conservative leaning social media companies that can rival FB  Twitter et al  Surely that  39 s the only real answer   So we should let gay couples get wedding cakes from any bakery.  Because Twitter is based off in the U.S. They dont give a shit about riots in China or Iran. Isnt it all about America first   This is easy. They are a for profit company and believe taking a stand  whether right or wrongly  against trump will result in long term profits. Taking a stand against ccp would mean twitter would never be able to operate in China and thus shut off from all those potential users.   Why ban pwople from here then   Freedom of Speech does not apply to private companies just like how any store can refuse to do business with you  so can twitter. If he wants to be heard he has a tv room ready to go 24 7.  Everybody here wines about censorship  yet most of the posts in this subreddit require you to be Flaired users which is tightly regulated by a small group of moderators who only allow  true  conservatives in... that seems like an absurd doublestandard to me  They re a private company  Why would they not have the right to do this   Twitter isn  39 t censoring Trump. Only the government can do that. Twitter is a private company that can host anyone or kick anyone off their network as they see fit. Remember   Well Trump is a traitor to our democracy so maybe that s why  His hair is fake too....  So you admit that DT is as bad as the CCP     I feel like this is trying to take away from the fact that Trump encouraged his followers to storm the capitol in an attempt of a  coup d  39 etat.  Trump isn  39 t being censored. He  39 s got a press office at the white house. He can go stand behind the podium and deliver his message directly to the people. Maybe take some questions from reporters.   Social media is the worst thing to have ever happened to humans. It has turned most people into self righteous and self centered a holes.  Twitter is just dirty. It s pathetic  Because the CCP didn  39 t incite a seditious riot at the Capitol during what is supposed to be a constitutionally peaceful transition of power after spreading lies  rumors and conspiracy theories without a shred of proof inflame millions with the false idea that the country was stolen.   I wonder if it s possible to get banned from these platforms for inciting violence against The Guvmint  other common left wing hate...aka..political comments from the Left wing perspective  to be clear Leftists making  threats to overthrow constitution and threats of physical violence against Pols    would be a  fun  experiment  You think Twitter gives a shit about the political leanings of the people who violate their TOS   Trump was banned for breaking the rules.  Lol its even funnier that conservative think forcing twitter to host content they dont agree with is a viable solution. Twitter is a private company  they arent legally required to host your speech  just like any physical business can control what happens on their property  twitter has every right to choose who they do business with  even if youd dont like it. How can the Republican party support allowing store owners to refuse service with people they dont agree with  gay people  but simultaneously want to force companies like Twitter to do business with people they dont agree with. Its hypocrisy. Businesses have rights just like you and I  they can do business to however they like  as long as they arent breaking the law  and refuse service to whoever they like  as long as they arent a protected class   If you dont like it  dont use their service  plain and simple  Lessons from history  Forced silence inexorably leads to violence.  So when a bakery doesnt want to bake a cake for a gay couple its fine  but when trump violates TOS of a private industry its somehow a violation of the 1st amendment  The 1st amendment exists to protect us from the government  not citizens private businesses.  Twitter isn t a public good it is private property  therefore Twitter can decide who can be on their platform and who can be taken off their platform. Just like reddit can decide who can make a site  and moderators can decide who can post. It isn t censorship because it doesn t involve the government like in China.  You don t like hearing about all the benefits of concentration camps    deleted   Twitter is not the government.  It is a private company and has the right to censor whomever they want.  That  39 s the free market.  That  39 s capitalism.  Well  did a member of the CCP use Twitter to form a mob and then use that mob to invade the capitol building   Interestingly enough  the CCP  a href  https   twitter.com ChineseEmbinUS status 1347247602094534658  rel  nofollow  tweet  a  referenced in the story now shows a notice that the tweet goes against their policy... yet the tweet and the account still exist. The  warning  is all for show.  Whats your point  Its a private company  dont like them  dont use their service  plain and simple
t3_kttq33,Mexican President AMLO Condemns Twitter Facebook for Censoring Donald Trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kttq33/mexican_president_amlo_condemns_twitter_facebook/,They make their money by having users. Deactivate your account today.  can  39 t. it was already banned. just like my last 13 accounts hahaha  How do you get banned  Whenever I comment something outrageous some random ass moron starts cursing me out and nothing happens.  I referred to Jack as a  cunt  and was banned instantaneously  You weren t lying tho...  i don  39 t know to be honest. they never told me.  1  Find photos of aborted fetus  As the looney toon punches the clown while looking at dismembered baby parts  This made me giggle  What are you even doing to get banned 10  times  expressing myself freely  I can already imagine.  I was banned thrice on transphobic grounds. Lol  To be fair actual transphobia is pretty terrible but I m curious as to what  Are you actually transphobic or was it just a heat of the moment angry comments you made   Not exactly phobic. But I don  39 t believe in it. Few scientific opinions are being misinterpreted as facts to show that is totally normal.  I get it  I  39 m in the same boat. I believe there  39 s only 2 genders  and I believe wanting to be a gender you  39 re not is a form of mental illness thats why its called  quot Gender dysphoria quot    Exactly  They could save us of so much confusion by learning to accept their body instead of creating a new identity.  100 . Unfortunately the left lumps everyone who doesn t agree with them the same.  They see your thoughts on trans people exactly the same as someone who says they should be dead.  EXACTLY THE SAME.  Because they re fucking insane.  How do you even evade a ban every account I make just gets banned again lol  Way ahead of ya. My partner and I deactivated our accounts with Facebook and Twitter. My liberal sisters are doing the same  they don  39 t like censorship on any level. My father doesn  39 t know how to use social media and is resolved to keep it that way  heh  .  Only deactivated  If you are serious then you will DELETE your account and wait a month without logging in to allow it to purge.   How do you delete them  I only saw options to deactivate the accounts.  Insta   a href  https   www.instagram.com accounts remove request permanent   https   www.instagram.com accounts remove request permanent   a   Never hand either. Waste of my very limited personal time and time from my very lucrative business selling Bed Bug powder to Antifa  BLM Protesters.  Market forces are no more our friends than weather patterns  but they are just as predictable.  Done.  What account   They sell us. We actually buy from them when we use their apps.  Isn  39 t it funny that the evil racist anti mexican president Trump became good friends with Mexican El Presidente           And Europe. It  39 s like they have dictators in living memory in Latin America.  It s pretty clear that not critiquing trump constantly makes you literally Adolf Hitler. You have to be super super smart to see the connection and totally not be an unhinged looney though  No fault on their end too. Most of them are headline readers and have no depth of knowledge. It s scary.  That and just the inability to consider and compare different perspectives on an event  The best quote for the day.  Crazy people  by definition  don t know they re crazy. I m not surprised that some blue haired motherfucker called you a Nazi for speaking truth.   The darkness hates the light.  You know it s bad when even the Mexican president is starting to see  and call out  all the bullshit going on with the left.  Let them eat gay cake   Lol  some people on the left really aren t mature enough to have a level headed debate.  Dude do yourself a favor and turn off dms and chats. I did have improved my user experience so much.  I ve NEVER gotten DM s for shit until I started posting here. I bet I have 20  from a few comments.  Imagine calling someone a nazi for saying Donald Trump is friends with the Mexican president  and that third world countries care more about free speech than the dems. How can one survive with so few brain cells   And shits just gonna get worse.  which parts of the world   It  39 s not as  quot funny quot  when you consider that presidents like Mexico  39 s AMLO are currently among the worst. It  39 s the same guy that went on national TV and publicly said covid was being handled with  quot hugs and prayers quot   and the same person that was caught in a family reunion of an important narco drug cartel member. And almost weekly he makes himself a national embarrassment on  a href   r Mexico  r Mexico  a    How is it that Mexico is now the bastion of free speech and democracy AND coke with real cane sugar     Also the other kind of coke.  And voter ID.  Mt. Dew throwback with real cane sugar is fing amazing.  How long do you think it  39 s going to take before white liberals start accusing Latinos  of Mexican descent and Mexicans in general  of being white and exercising white privilege   Already did it to the Cubans  It already happened when Florida went for Trump.  Suppressing expression will lead to extremism  amassing that republicans are not screaming at the stupidity of suppressing conservative points of view and so easily accept the labels of rioting and extremism while at the same time remained silent when antifa was burning and looting. Again suppressing of expression is the last thing a free country  or any  needs. The next step persecuting the opposition and silencing the little remaining free press. Write this down as it is happening. People have the government they deserve. And remember that ISIS was recruiting though Facebook  the Iran leader has called for the destruction of Isrrael and death to American without as mucha as being censored. Stop supporting the platforms of domination  close your accounts  let the feel that that.  Thank god there s a political figure outside the states that think it was wrong  We must look like a total joke to other countries.  We were once the dominant country and now we are a joke thanks to the Left.  China is obviously happy because they basically own us now.  It s bad enough they released the virus to begin with but now they become the dominant super power.  I feel like I m watching that movie Red Dawn 1984  except With no hopeful resolution in sight  At least we dont need to fear a future war with China. China will just continue to buy out every level of the US. In 20 30 years the US will be a second tier power. A servile state indebted to  owned by and politically aligned with China  with mass censorship and suppression of any and all dissenting voices.  I hope it never get to that point and the Republican  fights back But right now it looks bleak  I  39 ve been practicing shouting  quot Wolverines  quot    Yup.  I ever wanted it to come to this but we may have to start thinking about fighting back.  It s pretty clear they are trying to destroy conservatives and the Republican Party once and for all.  The media obviously wants a civil war but I honestly I think we would crush them because 95 percent of them are cowards   removed    removed   Gorilla with a U.  Remember the Harambamo   Rather have a condom and not need it  then need one and not have it.   There  39 s definitely a resolution in place for things like this. We  39 re just not there yet. Key word  yet.  Tbh these days everyone in Europe hates you Americans. Not the people per se  but the state and politics and cultural hegemony. Once American was cool  and these days if we refer to something being American it usually means it is something dumb.  That s funny. We don t think about you at all.  Nah  you  39 re a joke because Trump and his cult supporters.  Nah you re a joke.  Go back to  a href   r politics  r politics  a  where bullshit is a requirement  Politics  I  39 m not even subscribed to that sub lol  Yeah ok    Why are you so salty  Lol   em  quot If you don  39 t like Twitter  39 s rules  then go make you own platform  quot   em   Mexican here.  Hopefully he stands up to big tech and starts fining them for censorship in Mexico. US seems to be all talk but no action. Canada just seems to embrace censorship.  The Mexican President definitely truly has balls. More real than Israel  39 s Prime Minister that  39 s for damn sure.   removed   Lmao  what  The guy has everything but balls. It doesn  39 t take more than a quick peek at  a href   r Mexico  r Mexico  a  or local news to see how much of the educated part of the country hates this senile old man. If anything  you can bet that AMLO will bend over to whatever policy the next government introduces. He  39 s a jackass that is no better than previous presidents  if anything  maybe worse since he has made public how closely tied he is to local narco cartels by attending family meetings. Let alone his mishandling of Covid by making a national announcement that covid will be treated with  quot hugs and prayers quot . The only reason he won is because of his fake populism  of which he has struggled to keep almost all of his promises  Your fake news is not welcomed here.  To bad my trudeau doesnt have any balls   removed    removed   Thats not likely to happen.  But wasn  39 t he a radical communist  I  39 m confused.  It s a different president than the one when Trump entered office.  I know who he is. You know he is a left wing politician  right   AMLO is fucking bonkers. Years ago  he kinda did something similar to Trump  but worse. He declared himself president years ago in a previous election  even though he lost. He then paraded himself and his followers to their equivalent of America  39 s White House and rallied outside  as if he  39 d won  he didn  39 t . The people didn  39 t riot a government building  though. Still quite a fascinating comparison.  He also said Spain should ask forgiveness for the conquest of 500 years ago. The mofo maybe thinks his surname comes from some Aztec or Toltec ancestors lol  Seriously ballsy for him to stand up for Trump against what is arguably the most powerful enemy to ever exist.  This enemy has existed since the dawn of time.  I hope mexico is prepared for the border situation to be thrown into full reverse after biden financially ruins the country.  Sorry  not familiar with the border situation. Are you suggesting that it  39 s currently good  and Biden will make it worse...   I  39 m suggesting instead of people going from mexico to the US in droves it will be the other way around.  Wasn  39 t this already starting to happen due to strict lockdowns   I thought I remember hearing that.  Banning people means you re scared of what they re saying because it s calling you out. Even if someone is an idiot and writes something stupid  people can reply and explain to them how they are wrong and why they shouldn t say that. But duct tape over their mouth isn t democratic nor promoting free speech and exchange of ideas. It also keeps people from hearing other points of view and their own radical beliefs get further and further reinforced. We need to promote more discussion  not take out what we don t like. Even if you don t like what the person says  it doesn t matter. They still are alive on this earth and deserve to talk  Absolutely correct. Not only that  but they are actually promoting Trump and his ideas by banning him. Just look at the increase in sales of albums that got slapped with parental advisory stickers or movies that were banned or censored in other countries. When you say  quot Don  39 t look at this quot  it makes people want to see it even more...  The forbidden fruit is always sweeter   I believe that  39 s what  39 s called   39 The Streisand Effect  39 .  Agreed. I think the flaired users only thing is stupid 100   I would agree with this if the stupid population of the world were capable of having real discussion and understanding nuance  they aren  39 t and don  39 t .  Getting more support from Mexico then our own leadership... ohh the irony  Mexico President is based   You know he is kinda ta bitch when it come to the narco problem right   He s right. Mexico might be finishing the Trump wall to keep American communist refugees out after the Biden presidency.  My hope is that one of the ways this backfires is that half the country will get off social media and therefore out of their control.  He may be a leftist but he  39 s far more intellectually honest than most DC republicans  How is AMLO a leftist    a href  https   www.voanews.com americas obrador mexicos first leftist president decades  https   www.voanews.com americas obrador mexicos first leftist president decades  a   He s a populist.  How many years until democrats destabilize Mexico again   The century  39 s old two party system that AMLO broke is now united against him. They are running under the same party  like if the establishment democrats and the establishments republicans suddenly merge. Let  39 s see if AMLO can resist.  Based as fuck  They were going to find an excuse to do it anyway   deleted   Central American  Mexico is North America  The entire continent   Sorry Mexico is in  North America  You don  39 t even know Mexico is in North America. My gosh  Isn t this the dude that wants to hug drug cartels instead of treating them like drug cartels or was that the last president   Trump helped Mexico a ton.  No he didn t  Hmmm    AMLO is about to be the least corrupt leader in North America  Does he even have the internet   So  he is more American than our big tech overlords...  What happens to conservatism when trump abandons politics    He knows he s next if he dissents....  I like him  They are deplatforming Trump to lessen the impact his final announcements will have. Trump probably plans on releasing top secret information about aliens  the JFK assassination  etc.. He gave the intelligence agencies 180 days to make those announcements and now that Biden is in he probably doesn t trust the next administration to follow up with those demands so he will leak info himself.   deleted   As he should. What they have done is alienated half of the country  along with those worldwide that share similar beliefs. As a result  these big tech companies will  a href  https   www.foxbusiness.com markets twitter shares down nearly 4 in after hours trading following trump ban  lose stock  a   lose credibility  and suffer financial blunders.  Where  if anywhere  can Trump actually stay connected to his fanbase  Where can I see his message  Are there any platforms left execpt regular media and fox news     Havent heard from him in days..  The left doesn  39 t seem to understand that shutting down these users and sights is not about whether or not they agree with the opinion. It is about the protection of free speech which  in today  39 s society  includes social media platforms. Social media has become ingrained in the very fabric of most people  39 s lives. To simply say   quot Well  they are private companies and can do what they want quot  is a very interesting thing for the left to say. Just a couple of years ago  they forced a bakery to bake a cake for a gay couple  or risk fines  although they are a private company. They hypocrisy of the left is infuriating. The fact that their supporters either don  39 t notice it  due to stupidity  or act like it doesn  39 t occur  due to ignorance arrogance  is slightly more infuriating.  I just used Twitter to see trumps tweets but now I cant also who cares for the opinion of a pres of a third world yes Mexico is a third world country  I m glad I m seeing more and more people speaking out about how utterly insane this is. Although it s sad that it s coming from other countries and not the people it s directly affecting most  The Mexican government has now expressed more concern over the tech oligarchy than the entire Democratic party. Truly we live in the Clown World.  They  dems  said Trump is racist about Mexicans  he  39 s fascist etc... But censoring is somehow good thing for them.   Hey thanks to the decision of a republican supreme court in a case about gay wedding cakes the big tech giants can do this so... Trump fucked himself here lol  Ive never been so happy as when I deleted my Facebook and Twitter accounts. It s gold  This is the left flexing.   quot This is your boy  look what I can do to your boy. quot   Though AMLO was a socialist as well. Shocking to see a positive example of someone on the left speaking for what seems like free speech rights. Not expected  but I ll take it.
t3_ktu3ol,POTUS Cut Off from Supporters as Even Email Company Suspends Trumps Service,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ktu3ol/potus_cut_off_from_supporters_as_even_email/,So where you guys going when Reddit purges this forum  It s only a matter of time  Messenger pigeons  The best pigeons.   a href  https   imgur.com FV5gVGv.jpg  rel  nofollow  https   imgur.com FV5gVGv.jpg  a   Ham radio  A friend of mine in Kansas is into ham radio stuff  but says he cant do it officially because he needs a license or something  and that the office is still closed for covid  The issue isn  39 t that you need to get to a physical office to get your license  once you  39 ve passed the exam  you can handle everything on the FCC licensing portal .  He s totally wrong. The FCC is fully functional and the clubs that do the test are running as well.  Can t get more MAGA than ham radio  That would be fun. Just pretend we re in the Cold War communicating secretly.  The  5G causes COVID  faction of the GOP are all of a sudden experts in wireless communication   That s fucking rich.  I got my license. Get yours people    Chain letters  Just going to buy one of those Ravens from GOT  Then you have to be reminded of how awful GoT was every time you see it though.  It  39 s not worth re watching it knowing the ending.  GOT  39 s shit ending...  Something conservatives and liberals can actually come together and agree on.  There are individual episodes worth watching  but yeah  tried to get into it again with HBOMax and it s fucking lame. The overall story really isn t that interesting.  for me  it was always about the production value they were putting into a TV series  especially after first 2 seasons . My friends didn  39 t like hearing me criticize the story.  Stupid Dan and Dave   DaNy JuSt KiNd Of FoRgOt    deleted   Discord is not as safe as you think. Parler is fine  though apple google are pursuing locking them out of their app store to greatly reduce the number of people able to access their communities.  Discord deleted all of the largest pro trump groups yesterday. You aren  39 t escaping there  Wouldn  39 t the best way to remain undetected   create a discord with a name etc completely unrelated to Conservatism   But discuss said topic  Or is there some algorithm yadda yadda   The real challenge is these are all private companies and they can make whatever rules they want.   Something to think on  is that the problem isn t conservatism  it is the jackasses calling for violence in the name of conservatism. Liberals don t really care if it is a debate of ideas  but too many fools feel the need to call for violence if they don t get their way. That is why they are getting shut down.  The hang pence crap on Twitter is an example here  I can see that   and understand that . However the voices of the few shouldn  39 t dictate the punishment of the many.  I don t disagree  but in the case of any of this  you are dealing with private companies. They have as much right to refuse service to any of us as a baker has to not make a wedding cake for someone whose lifestyle he disagrees with.  All that said  I have this argument with my more liberal friends who are cheering the deplatforming of these sites  basically my position is that they are cheering something that might happen to them i the future.  The vocal minority unfortunately is louder than the quiet indifferent majority.  Amazon announced they are not going to host Parler as of tomorrow.  Amazon AWS halting Parker....they re done  Ah  does discord have Chinese interests or some shit   Tencent  a CCP company has an interest in Discord.  No they are far left activist similar to the reddit admins. They have and do ban conservatives. The service was built so support gamers  so not incredibly surprising. I use it  but admins will insert themselves into channels and ban people.  If you ain  39 t left and trying to silence conservatives yer a booklicking fascist white supremecist nazi.  The moment I started questioning BLM  39 s motives over the summer  a handful of my friends seemed to become a bit wary of me. And in discussing the events over the summer with strangers online  I was immediately a super bigot fascist for presenting another side.   And that  39 s how I got pushed here as well. I thought of my self as a liberal for the longest time until I realized Meritocracy  family and freedom of speech are far right positions.  Fuckin a  friendo. This summer was my turning point. I wasn  39 t ever a hardcore Democrat  but I did consider myself liberal. Turns out I just hadn  39 t put in the self reflection and history research. I still don  39 t consider myself far right tho  even tho the ideals you mention are all very important to me.  I always held these values but I thought these were moderate values.   Welcome to the realities of the left. Hive mind of children.  Dark days ahead.   it really says that the average American European hasn  39 t a clue about political history.  When I was like 10 or whatever  I HATED history class.  Every dayi would ask my mom  quot whyyyy do I even need to know this   It  39 s in the past  it all happened already.  They  39 re dead and there  39 s nothing I can do to change it. quot   She told me that those who don  39 t know their history are doomed to repeat it.  10 year old me rolled my eyes at the platitude.  20 something year old me cringes so hard at how right mom is turning out to be.  They either don  39 t know the history or condemn everything about the past pretending you can build utopia themselves which would lead to a new Stalin.  Yeah man  people are herd creatures and will eat you if you step outside acceptable norms. Questioning the narrative makes you an evil racist and evil racists do not have human rights.  Soon apple will kill parler though    You can still access it through the web. You actually don t need an app.  ..but I  em want  em  an app  Well  I guess you could write one  Didn t you learn to code when Obama told you to   Would still get banned from the App Store if parler itself is banned  Such a shame.  Ehhhhh this post didnt age well did it   I only joined the Donald sub after it got quarantined. Just my personality I guess  the more you tell me I can  39 t do or say something  the more interest I take in it.  I  39 m a moderate conservative. But this sub is so much more reasonable than the rest of the Reddit echo chamber.  That  39 s not a high threshold tbh.   The problem  is that bigger companies and maybe even the government eventually  will be able to silence these new sources of information. All the new apps that are letting people speak aren t going to get any good funding to actually be good apps.  Don  39 t stress. There will always be black markets. There will always be an underground. There will always be people trying to help and come together. The names may change but there will always be one.  You are right  but every hoop you have to jump through to get to those sources will make it so that less and less people will want to get to those sources. And we shouldn t have to go underground to share our speech  it s really disappointing to see what s happening. And to think  democrats always call republicans the nazis  Parler  Protonmail  Signal.    I mean nowere really. Our only choice is a Conservative dot win page just like thedonald or conspiracy.

I mean this is just insane  They will one day  when it happens to them.  Nah  I  39 m left of center  wouldn  39 t call myself a democrat  married to someone who would call themselves a democrat.  Regardless of what you think about trump or conservative ideas  just know that you will not be allowed to think  discuss or see anything that isn  39 t approved by big tech and aligns with their current ideology.   I can agree to that. That s why it s important to rely on sources other than electronics and to do some of your own investigations. Or at least have a neutral standing on things you don t fully understand. Being an iconoclast also helps.  If they can remove the President of the United States  they can and will remove you too.  The removal of Trump is shocking in many ways  but we  39 re also already under pretty heavy algorithmic manipulation. It  39 s not conjecture  it  39 s easily proven fact. And it  39 s changing everything.  I love moderates like you who can see both sides.   Despise Trump but this is going too far. Anyone who thinks this is not a dangerous precedence is delusional. They literally in unison cut off the bloodline in an instant. Forget Trump. The mere fact that they can do this worries the hell out of me.  Yet still post the  quot First they came for the... quot  quote.  As if they haven t been flapping their fat mouths for the last 5 years  resisting literally anything POTUS said. SPARE ME    deleted   Welcome to free market capitalism. They re allowed to do that. The issue isn t with the bans.   Its not really free market capitalism if there is not a readily available competitor. These companies monopolistic behavior is what drives mass dependency to their product  in this case their platform.  I mean  it is though. Monopolies will naturally form in a free market. Nature of the beast.   This is what bewildered me. How the fk do people truly believe they are stopping a Hitler rising. How do we get to them when we got banned off every platform  We can  39 t even stop the hivemind now  To them the ends justifies the means.  These people applaud and cheer any authoritarian force  even if they can see and admit its blatantly corrupt and anti democratic. As long as they step on the neck of their political enemies first they don  39 t care what happens. THey just chase the high of the   39 win  39  over everything.   moderate  democrat here  it s pretty fucking ridiculous that  em all  em  methods of communication from the president are being cut off. I don t like the guy  but this shit isn t healthy for democracy  especially at this time.  Moderate democrat here  I also believe the silencing is alarming  I agree with you and you  39 re right...it isn  39 t. So basically  his rights to speak have been stripped. What are they so afraid of  If the election was won fair and square  then the new administration takes office in a mere 10 days. Cutting off all communication seems so extreme to me. Not just for Trump but locking out anyone with dessenting opinions. While the spotlight is now on the right  it can easily swing left. Scary times we are living in right now.  They  39 re not. He can still hold a press conference  he won  39 t. He has a lot of ways to speak to the American people. A private company is  and should be  allowed to ban anybody from their service.  media outlets don t air his conferences  My husband and I had a whole conversation with my MIL last night about this  and she isn t concerned at all.  There aren t any  Moderate  Democrats left.  When their own liberties are taken away  but it ll be too late by then..  I think most of the  rational left  is worried about where this is going even though most are ok with kicking him off twitter specifically. But they are impotent against the gleeful mob right now. I wish people would listen to Greenwald and his warnings of overreaction.  They are becoming as dogmatic as the Catholic Church was at the height of their powers in the Middle Ages.   At this point it  39 s collusion between all of big tech and using there monopolistic powers to undermine the president of the USA.  He isn  39 t  quot banned from the internet. quot  He can go right to his own webpage and post anything he wants and everyone can go and read it if they want to.  He also can use a variety of tools that other presidents have used like press releases and interviews. Twitter isn  39 t his only avenue. Presidents spoke to the public before it  I really don t understand the outrage here. How is this different than the gay wedding cake case  These are private companies. And it s absurd to pretend like this is muzzling the president  he lives in a house with a press briefing room in it. He is fully capable of speaking to Americans without Twitter  just as every president before him has.  If only there was a way for the President to directly address the people. Like a designated room with cameras to broadcast a message. It could even have members of the press there. It would be like a  press room  or something.  My grandpa told me of a place like that. I forgot what its called  It  39 s so funny that people are acting the president has no other avenues beside Twitter   I think you might be on to something.  I don t like all the deplatforminv  but he s not cut off from his supporters. The man has a goddamn PRESSROOM in his house and can have every media outlet on the planet filming him at a moments notice.  All themlibs over at  a href   r news  r news  a  are laughing not understanding what the implications of a mass ban of an account not just the president.  Twitter changed their rules to allow the president to break them   because he brought in much more money through controversy which drives engagement and ad sales  but they also needed a rationale so they expanded it to all world leaders .  He was never held to the same rules as a common citizen  who would get immediately banned for many of he things he did on there that were against the TOS  doxing people  etc. .  They Ban trump but allow the ayatollah in Iran to call for genocide of all Jews. Same with Farrakhan.   I think a lot of people seem to forget that the first amendment means the GOVERNMENT can  39 t prevent you from stating your opinion.    He has a press room in his fucking house. He can have a press conference and say whatever he wants at any time. Twitter can not stop him from talking.  I  39 m sorry but this is pure hyperbole.   You guys know private businesses reserve the right to deny service in America right   Lmao to bad he doesn  39 t have an official some would say presidential way to address the people of the USA... if only  Trump was warned. For awhile it seemed like he would act. Then nothing. This is the result of inaction.  Usually totalitarian regimes take away the people  39 s guns before they enforce extreme censorship.  They re coming for those next.  Well we  39 re prepared because they decided to put the cart infront of the horse  As a libertarian  I support private businesses rights to deny service. Stop crying about it.  Can I have some examples  actual question   December 10  1918  the Council of People s Commissar mandated that Soviet citizens turn in their firearms. Failure to do so  led to criminal prosecution.  Thanks  You guys act like Trump is the first POTUS to never have access to social media.  He isn  39 t any more cut off from the public than any of his predecessors pre social media  he just doesn  39 t like the accountability that comes from having press briefings.  But by all means  keep thinking that this isn  39 t the exact kind of behavior that conservatives have been clamoring for by businesses.  i was wondering why i haven  39 t been getting 15 emails a day from the Trump campaign anymore lmao  When you re an active domestic terrorist with access to USA nuclear codes then yeah makes sense why Trump has been dunked into the dark ages. Hopefully he s purged forever and the Conservative party can someday recoup and have a better foundation than own the libs. Maybe try  run a country and unite the United States.  I think as long as you guys don  39 t try to organize an Insurrection  promote violence especially around the inauguration youll probably be fine.  Well he has his own private domains and he can always use it.  Until the hosting company pulls the plug.  Nothing stopping them from self hosting. It  39 s not difficult  I  39 m sure a multi billionaire can pay someone to do it  Until CDN  SSL  DNS  etc providers all ban his website too. And even the ISP could. Why stop at email accounts   I mean sure  but there are significantly worse sites out there that are still hosted by ISPs. I don  39 t see that happening.   Freedom of speech is more of an idea than a reality now. Don  39 t like being banned from social media  Make your own  bigot. Try to make your own  Fuck you  now you  39 re banned by banks and payment processors  make your own bigot    deleted   They don  39 t care. Pelosi is publicly circumventing Trump and obstructing his military command. An absolute attempt at a coup  and they applaud her.  You all crying about stuff being taken down because it  39 s  quot conservative views quot  are ridiculous. Have you ever seen the stuff posted on Parler   Oh no  The consequences of his actions. How horrible for him.  Say goodbye 230  Like the Democrat controlled congress is ever going to punish their ministry of propaganda.  Legit question not trying to be snarky or anything. If 230 went away  wouldn  39 t Parler then be open to all sorts of legal action due to the posts about violence on there  I just used Parler as an example since I see posts news about the content.  Yes  people don t seem to realize that making social media liable for what is posted on it will result in significantly more moderation of content.  The rules will be much stricter  not more lax  Wouldn  39 t practically web forums be open to leagal action for what their users post   It would shut down practically all social media  though that may not be a bad thing.  ... that no email provider is subject to.  This has nothing to do with section 230.  This is a company parting ways with a client they think negatively impacts them.    Ah  yes. The man with an entire room dedicated to broadcasting his every word to the world and a team of journalists on standby whose job it is to report on everything he says and does is so  cut off . The imaginary victim complex of conservatives just keeps on keeping on.  Guys I just have to point out that an email server costs a few hundred dollars  nobody can cut off Trump  39 s ability to send emails for more than the half hour it  39 d take an IT guy to set up a server for him.  Obviously the President needs to be able to communicate with the American people. The Twitter ban seems sudden and ultimately spineless  2 weeks left   but Trump also abused that Twitter account if it was an official communication channel. He kind used it more as a medium for whatever random thing cross his head while he was taking a shit.  Particularly CSPAN. If you think CSPAN is fake news  you re probably brain washed and need to step out of the cult.  Guy is still the president of the free world  he could be on tv 24 7 if he so chose. Just because his attention span is only at twitter levels doesn  39 t mean he  39 s been  quot silenced quot .  Did Twitter fire the entire communications staff and broadcast equipment of the White House  Did not know they had that kind of pull.  Even leftists should be scared that the power to completely cancel a still sitting president these tech companies have. Do they really think they are part of the team as their useful idiots   Ahh yes  completely canceled. Except for Parler  fox  newsmax  oan  and the ability to hold press conferences and make televised speeches directly to the public.  Parler is supposed to be removed from AWS tomorrow.  What are you guys taking about  He  39 s still the president. He has a room IN HIS HOUSE designed for televised broadcasts. There are people there 24 7 waiting to put him on TV. He CHOOSES not to use it.  I think a lot of people are mistaking what twitter is doing for stifling free speech  when they  39 re just exercising their right not to spread Trump  39 s dangerous rhetoric and propaganda. They are not obligated to do so. For instance  If I wanted to run a libelous article about a political opponent  I can  39 t force the Post to nationally distribute it. I  39 m welcome to mutter my lies to myself in my home. Hell  I can say so in public and people will decide for themselves if I  39 m crazy or not. The difference with Trump is his influence and wide reach. Not all of us with conservative values are these terrible people that sometimes get swept into generalized statements  but it  39 s clear that some Trump supporters can  39 t be trusted to discern an alternate reality provided to them by Trump from the way things actually are.  This is really some Orwellian crap  They re going to push us to the dark web.  All he has to do is hold a press conference.  At least he still has the postal system.... oh wait.  Here  39 s an honest question. What if it was President Obama who tried this shit plus the calls to Georgia    I would imagine that if Obama had tried this  the world would be just as mad at him too.  It  39 s amazingly disappointing how  people are so  dumb as fuck.  It  39 s embarrassing.  Those w a passport get the point.  Just wait till they learn about mister bones wild ride.  I think people have forgotten the president has more ways than just social media to address the people. Its like people have forgotten what a president acting presidential looks like.  He  39 s been banned because he  39 s a criminal with power. He needs to be ousted and jailed.  As a conservative  I support the right of private companies to choose with whom they do business.  He incited a coup. Aren t you guys the law and order party   Yeah it may have been a good idea to start cracking down on Big Tech when we had the senate  Honestly wondering  what is it you would have wanted them to do   You do know that if they got rid of 230  these tech companies could bece liable for what is posted on their platforms and Trump would have been banned sooner instead of twitter  39 s cute little  quot hey  here  39 s an exclamation point  hopefully whoever sees this has enough common sense to understand Trump is lying about election fraud  but for the time being he can spread it on our platform quot   right   a party with no foresight deserves to lose. if this is what sparks a big focus on some Big Tech antitrust from the republlican party  I  39 m all for it.  Should have been done in 2016 2018 instead of... whatever they did.

Don  39 t really like Parler. Tired of arguing with my brother in law on Facebook.   Honestly maybe we would all be better off with less social media anyway  Watch the Netflix Documentary  The Social Dilemma.  I ve cut out most social media since then and it s been very refreshing.  The scary part is I  39 ve known this for years and everyone thought I was going insane.  It  39 s odd  in college I brought up the negative effect social media can have on childhood development and mental health and it was met with  resistance... It was viewed more as an avenue for implementing positive social change  more appropriately social upheaval .  I remember getting weird looks when people asked me  quot are you on Facebook quot  and my answer was  quot No quot .  That BBQ sub only serves to remind me how much my BBQ sucks.  Haha..  a href   r smoking  r smoking  a  is my home sub that I follow.   And that  39 s how they won the culture war.  Conservatives just burying their heads in the sand and live in their little bubble of backyard barbecues and football while leftism spreads  across the country unchecked.  I didn  39 t realize how much was tracked until I started to work in development. Seeing how long people stay on a screen  which pages they navigate to and from where  which device and platform they  39 re using  etc all tired to a single user. Just a crazy amount of data that is tracked and that  39 s just on a basic fitness application.  You and me both. I was out of all social media for quite a while and it was a really nice reset. I got back in with Reddit but mostly just browsed around looking at dumb pictures for a while. I finally got a Facebook again but I don t have it on my phone and I only access it at work because it s for marketing purposes only. I suppose I had a LinkedIn during that period but I seldom use it and it s kind of a different thing anyway. I periodically consider cutting all of them off my phone as a means to keep it from being too much of a thing for me and sometimes I do for a weekend or a few days if I feel like it s getting too pervasive or controlling for me. Essentially  once you understand it and you decide to control it by stepping away for a long enough period  you can do alright. But I ll admit  if it wasn t as socially pervasive  I would prefer we just do away with it altogether as a society. It s not really a positive for any aspect of society.   quot Do you know smoking is bad for you...  quot   Exactly this as well from both my own and my fiance  39 s families. Young adults have known this for a while  and have been blowing the whistle for just as long. Same as everything though  nobody pays attention until a problem is 10x as big and 20x as hard to solve  We  39 ve been using it oconus for over a decade now to cause political chaos and upheaval.  Another good one is  The Plot against the President  This one shows the lefts bias against Trump from before he took office  with a rant from Pelosi.  Social Media usage has a good running line with increase in social mental illness.  Very true  But the reality is you can  39 t engage in politics without social media. It is the equivalent if trying to campaign with one arm tied behind your back. There are millions on those platforms  and they are incredibly slanted along with mainstream media.  Campaigning   What s that    When you have both traditional and social media do it for you  you don  39 t need to   more like  quot it doesn  39 t matter who votes  it matters who counts the votes quot   Despite any possible voter irregularities  Biden would have won at least the popular vote. Entirely because of his overwhelming media support.  Hey Joey my guy  how s the red  He had COVID going for him... I think if it weren t for that and had he actually campaigned  none of this would have ever worked out.  Yeah. COVID pretty much destroyed our country.  He had the media do the campaigning for him  We finally found out how to get money out of politics  rig the elections  We ve come full circle  because social media is the literal equivalent of the printed pamphlets and newsletters that the colonists used to debate the political situation with England Pre Revolutionary War.   The harder and firmer the tech firms apply pressure  the more they solidify the resolve against them.  They are literally painting targets on themselves.  Britain also had this standing policy of bringing up on sedition charges such writers  hence why Benjamin Franklin wrote under a pseudonym.  Not quite. Yes  it is used for that purpose  but printed pamphlets  papers  and the like still exist and people hand those out in many places  college campuses  churches  schools  rallies  etc.  I know. I  39 ve even said that in other comments. Honestly I just miss the days before social media existed  No  quot maybe quot  about it. Social media is the worst thing ever invented  and I  39 m not being hyperbolic.  It was designed to bring people together  but it  39 s mostly just driven people away.  Once politics got involved it went to shit  I argue that politics were there from the get go  just people tended to ignore it. Now it  39 s like someone that jumped on your table at Applebees and shoved their junk in your face  you can  39 t ignore it.  That  39 s an oddly specific scenerio  MySpace was fun and politics free for the most part  plus scantily clad chicks were the norm  MySpace was mostly for high schoolers. I don t remember it ever getting big enough to include senators and world leaders...  Same here.  Does Reddit count as social media   I think so but it  39 s mostly anonymous so it  39 s a bit different  Social media is genuinely damaging society. Between division and depression and other things as well  it can  39 t be overstated just how negatively it has impacted this country  I dream of the day we humans realize our brains were not meant to be bombarded with these amount of information 24 7 especially without training or discipline.  Legit I m thinking about going back to a flip phone. No news is good news.     Quill and parchment paper like our founding fathers    We could go down to the local tavern and discuss and write down our thoughts. Alcohol is good in that it lowers your inhibitions and you will say what is truly on your mind. Not just what people want to hear.  Covid rules bans in person meetings  I think there is enough bars in peoples homes to get past that. New era of speakeasies  I  39 d get rid of facebook  but I.. have so many people I keep in contact with through there.  Imagine a national letter to the editor writing campaign where there  39 s an organized series of submitted articles to local papers across the country.  All engaging in non toxic  non hostile discussion of political news.  Return to letters  Or using couriers  Just like in the old days  when we had to photograph our meal  develop the photo  then take it to our friends houses one after another to show them.  Can t stop the signal  Mal.  To their credit  Parler has been getting a lot better  I never use Twitter either. It  39 s for Twits  as far as I  39 m concerned. We need our own  and Parler needs support now.  Twitter spokeswoman claimed that tweets from the Iranian leader   where he has publicly called for the  elimination  of Israel   amounted to little more than  foreign policy saber rattling.   The look on the twitter spokesperson face when she was asked why declaring genocide on Twitter was OK.  The level of this kind of shit from the media  Twitter  etc. over the past few years is just insane  but not at all surprising anymore.  They have lost 100  of their credibility  and it s hard to understand how they and others don t see it.  To everyone who ever called Trump a dictator  a dictator can  39 t be censored.  The one doing the censoring is the dictator.  Yeah.  Those claims were clearly ridiculous.  If you are getting pushed back from all the establishment  you are probably doing something right for the people  Oh c  39 mon  nobody cares about anti Semitic views. The left has proven they don  39 t care about the Jewish community.  And don t forget about Asians     I just love it how poor Asians have been kicked out of the   39 POC  39  definition for their financial independence and academic achievements. Now it  39 s   39 BIPOC  39  apparently.  That s because  success  is being re defined as  racist.    Now now now.  Not just don t care  they hate Jews bc they subvert the oppressed minority stereotype their worldview is built around.  They love secular Jews though because they are a 100  reliable voting block.  I m the smallest minority I know  a secular Jew that despises the left.  Watch your back  brother.  It  39 s not like Iran has killed any Israeli citizens or anything.  s  The left wouldn t mind the destruction of Israel. You can find tons of redditors calling Israel the same disgusting words such as  cancerous growth  the ayatollah uses.  Yeah that  39 s ridiculous  Vijaya s at it again  Currently watching the JRE podcast with her  tim pool  and Jack Dorsey. She is an absolute joke of a human.  Vijaya  we have to look at the context  Gadje.  Have not seen contortions like that since the Exorcist  Twitter allowed ISIS to use their platform to promote their ideology and recruit for years  they  are not operating in good faith.  Do you remember when Maxine Waters literally told people tobopenly harass any Republican lawmakers that they saw dining in public and all that and that wasn  39 t considered any kind of problem   Vividly  Yes. I  39 m old enough to remember a year ago.  Social media was a mistake. Across the board. I think we will see a reversal of technology in the coming years  Social media as a tool to keep up with family is great. I don  39 t have to send individual messages  or bulk emails  I just post shit to my wall. I can message people using apps without ever giving out my phone number. It serves a good purpose.  Yes but social media also is fake and feels fake and lazy.   2024 raises the spectre of having a candidate banned from all forms of social media running against one endorsed by it.  Doubtful. Kids today grew up with it. They wouldn  39 t know how to or even want to function without it.  Twitter is a joke and this excuse makes them look even worse. Just say  quot we don  39 t like Trump and what he represents  so we decided to take him off our platform. quot   Isn t that the country that hung hundreds of protesters on cranes   I think I ve honestly just got some clarity  big tech and whoever else is entangled with them is literally trying to incite more anger and resentment from Conservatives  the Capitol incident was their perfect excuse  and now they can do whatever they want and use the conservative outraged reactions to justify more censorship further and further.  They ve been waiting for four years for the right to finally cave in and say  you know what... it looks like the only thing you ll pay attention to is a riot...  and do exactly what they ve been encouraging leftists to do. The  em second  em  that the left s insanity was even sort of matched  they used it as an excuse to label right wing rioters as terrorists. They didn t even get a chance to be  peaceful protestors  because they were labeled as violent Nazis the second they stated their intent to protest. They skipped right over  rioters  as well and went straight to  domestic terrorists.  The consequences for terrorism are a  em lot  em  worse than rioting  and certainly worse than the ones our favorite little peaceful protesters received. To put things in perspective  we were calling for arrests and prosecutions for the destruction of people s private property by people involved in BLM riots. People on the left are calling for the rioters in the Capitol to be declared a terrorist  stripped of their citizenship  and be tried for treason  remember what the penalty for treason is  anyone  . They want resistance to be punishable by death. It won t be long until it moves from censorship to mass murder. Stay safe. They re scared now  and they re going to do whatever it takes to maintain the power they ve grabbed  and they certainly have no problems with disposing of you if you threaten that in any capacity.  Also note that if a leftist  quot protester quot  is carrying an AR15  the media calls it  quot a long gun quot . If a conservative carries it even while hunting game in the woods  let alone at a protest   the media calls it  quot an assault rifle. quot   You want to know how truly nuts they are   Last year I had a couple people tell me that the American flag was essentially a sign of white supremacy or some shit.  I wanted to tell them how pathetic they were  but I kept it to myself.  There  39 s no reasoning with people who think that.  Yeah  that s what I figured.  Find me a country that has never done anything bad  and I will move there immediately. Until then  I know of nowhere else better to live than the US.  Right  everyone does bad stuff.  So what   Our goals and values are good  and that is what the flag stands for.  Just removed Twitter and cash app from my phone. Not using them is  the least I can do.   deleted   Jack Dorsey is the CEO of both Twitter and Square  which owns Cash App.   deleted   I don t give a shit anymore. We had almost 3 decades of shit presidents before him and probably all the rest during my life will be shit. Social media is cancer and has placed this country under mob rule   quot BuT iTz A pRiVaTe CoMpAnY LaWlZ quot    the left  suddenly taking the side of that baker who didn  39 t want to make gay wedding cakes.  Can someone explain how they are still protected under 230 with this blatant selective enforcement  It s an obvious publisher move.  Take away 230. It would solve a lot of problems IMO.  Never happen now. Democrats control everything and social media is in their corner.  230 will not be taken away or enforced the way it s supposed to be by Dems in exchange for big tech censoring opposition.  Just deactivated my Twitter account and deleted the App. Don t need it anymore.  Same here.  Not to mention that recent genocidal tweet by China  Not only this. After the recent beheading of that teacher in France  many muslim world leaders called for killing of French people and the president on social media. Those tweets weren  39 t even flagged.  Which Muslim world leaders   Death to America good. America First bad. What lunacy.  I am not American but this really infuriates me. This is not the America I grew up to respect. The fact that the left runs big tech and gets away with promoting BLM riots while banning Trump  blocking conservatives and bringing down Parler. Jeez  you guys should storm the capital or something.  Hahaha. I absolutely love foreigners who get what we are dealing with.     The bias wouldn  39 t be as troubling if we weren  39 t being gaslit and told there is no bias.  I can handle it if the bias is there in the open.    Maybe this will ultimately lead to something I didn t think would ever happen  the end of social media.  Way down the road  maybe after our time.  I think it s a good thing in that sense  but fuck this attempted censorship of the Right.  There is no defense  Twitter is a leftist propaganda publisher and should be treated as such.  Stop using Twitter.  People that use Twitter after this are complete suckers  Fuck Twitter. Walk away.  They should both be permitted. Both are saber rattling at most.  Deactivated my Twitter account today. Not looking back  In the post constitutional  Orwellian USA this will make sense to people.   em ruLES fOR thEE buT nOT ayaTOLLaH khaMENei  em   How anyone could support the democrat or the mainstream media after their neverending hypocrisy the last 4 years. The hilarity of calling what happened at the capital last week a  riot  yet when blm and Antifa literally tried to burn down multiple federal buildings among all the other violent crime they committed  that was called a  mostly peaceful protest   Makes sense. After the antisemitic comments the DNC made about Bernie Sanders  it seems that they agree with Khamenei on a great many things.  I walked away from fascistbook when they started heavily censoring conservatives. Am walking away from twatter for the same reason.  Will walk from here if they push the issue.  They need me more than I need them I can assure you.  not surprising they  39 d offer some half baked defense of their blatant partisanship. the last month or so should have made it pretty clear that twitter had it out for him and was merely preparing their excuses.  Social media is a joke and always will be. Makes me mad but not surprised. They  39 re scum.  They literally banned trump because he said he wasnt attending bidens inauguration  Of course they do  fkkin hypocrites  This is what I don  39 t get.  There is a zero percent chance that Donald Trump posts his own tweets.  100  is Dan Scavino  Hope Hicks  and the rest of the social media  amp  communications teams.  Just like Katie Dowd and her team manages Hillary Clinton  39 s social media platforms  and Rob Flaherty for Joe Biden.    Fuck TWATTER   They should do both.  Things like this confirm that having never been interested in the Twitter sphere was the right choice for me. These are adolescent mentality adults running tech companies and exerting their power where they can  which is sadly misplaced. It  39 s about one thing   quot Get into line with our views or you  39 re no longer on our site. quot  Grow up.  And people act surprised that so many marched on the capitol the other day. Shit like this over the past few years has built up and people have had enough.  For the past year  people have been burning down entire city blocks with media and politicians making excuses to justify it. Same media and politicians that for three years was filling everyone  39 s head that the last election was stolen  planting the seeds of distrust towards the election system. Now they pretend to be appalled... The irony....  Muslim good America bad  NO. SHIT.  Or Venezuela s Maduro....  Pointing out their hypocrisy is stupid  they know that they don t have consistent standards no shit. This isn t about vague inconsistent rules or whatever  it s just about them shutting down certain political viewpoints and using some random line as a weak cover  Biden police state technocracy incoming. be ready.  Ugh what kind of mental gymnastics are they doing to justify this  I wonder   The timing of the ban of parler and Trumps Twitter ban is very suspicious.

Imagine if someone had done this to Obama...this really applies to everything that they have put Trump through the last 4 years.  The fact that any liberal allied intern was let anywhere near the State Department  let alone inside it  is a quintessential illustration of the failure of this administration to adequately put down the leftists insurgents  Some liberal intern editing the web page.  There is absolutely nothing of value here. Both Pence and Trump have the same thing reflected on their pages. Buzzfeed is reporting that a disgruntled staffer changed them.

You see the thing is  the left has no opposition  every  opposition voice has been or will be silenced. There is no incentive for Biden  39 s administration to not roll back and cut ties all together. I  39 m curious to see the outcome and I  39 m hopeful that you  39 re right. Taiwan is a pretty great nation and I would hate to see it not recognized as such.  This is a great move  and in our short term and long term interests.

t3_ku3sx5,Parler reportedly removed posts by Trump affiliate Lin Wood,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku3sx5/parler_reportedly_removed_posts_by_trump/,Around the second or third time Sidney Powell said the word kraken I stopped paying attention to the Trump orbit so I m not entirely sure who this Lin Wood cat is  but he seems insane  Yeah I quickly looked at them in a religious perspective. I m agnostic but if Jesus comes down on a cloud one day  I m gonna say  I stand corrected   I m in    Their allegations I m like  I want this to be true cause it s honestly believable and would helped but I m tuning you out until you show me something .   The dude is a lunatic.  That s an understatement  Yup.  i can t believe anyone listens to the shit lin spews out  He s been right about nearly everything though...  He  39 s been right about nothing  but he has called for the execution of Mike Pence and others. He keeps saying he has tapes of Justice Roberts and other elites raping and killing children  ut he won  39 t release until the time is right.  He is a lunatic  and contributed greatly to our loss in Georgia  people should not listen to him. However I wouldn t put anything past the elite.  Not saying you should blindly believe him  but would you be surprised if certain elites were the scum of the earth   I  39 m sure some are  but if Lin Wood says someone is  I  39 m more likely to believe they aren  39 t than I was before.  He knew about loeffler  proved pence has been trying to undermine trump  he tells it like it is. I do agree he shouldn t have tried to undermine the Georgia election  but I also can t blame someone for not wanting to vote in a rigged election. I know I won t be voting again.  He also said Trump was going to use the insurrection act and pretty much has made every outlandish claim you could think of.  This is true.  Umm I follow Lin for awhile on Twitter and now Parler  I don  39 t seem to recall anything like that. I disagree with plenty he says ofc.   a href  https   fellowshipoftheminds.com wp content uploads 2021 01 Lin Wood2.jpg  https   fellowshipoftheminds.com wp content uploads 2021 01 Lin Wood2.jpg  a   I don  39 t know why that  39 s getting dv. Lin Sidney and Flynn are really radical  but they were talking about things months before they came out in the open.  They say things that are very outlandish  and take backlash from everyone saying they  39 re crazy.  Then it turns out to be true.  Funny how that works.  Everyone said Powell was crazy to say what she did about Dominion and votes being switched back in early November. Look where we are now.  You may have to elaborate as some stuff as admittedly been a little our there. However I  39 m happy to be wrong if that  39 s the cause  Good.

I think you  39 re at least correct ish  though when there were calls for riots and killing white and rich people over the summer we were told that incitement requires a call to action at a specific place and time.  Perhaps that has changed again.  He s an absolute head case tbf  The guy started out as a high profile attorney and now has reduced himself to a crackpot.  What I gather from this is that Parler indeed has limits. Apple and Google would have you believe that they have no enforcement whatsoever. I would like to think that this shows that Parler will intervene IF CLEAR LINES ARE CROSSED.  I m a little lost here. Who is this guy and what has he done   Q anon  It sounds like the Parlor ToS are a bit more explicit about how parlays conveying violence are handled. Though j think people like Wood should work harder to not use language that can be so misconstrued and twisted as to result in ToS violations. Just use some different language to convey your otherwise on point messaging.  I mean  let  39 s be honest  his message was clear as day.  Appeasing the Looney Liberals achieves nothing but a short lived moment of quiet
t3_ktytc9,Dems to introduce article of impeachment against Trump on Monday,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ktytc9/dems_to_introduce_article_of_impeachment_against/,Both parties are afraid of Trump running in 2024.  Aren  39 t there more important things to focus on  Biden  39 s inauguration is January 20th.  Let it go   and let  39 s get something done on DC.    I  39 ve been reading that they want to shove this through before some executive order that Trump may put through before he leaves  possibly with declassifying everything  which has many dims awfully nervous.  Potentially not only dims sweating a bit.  John Roberts comes to mind.  Why was this downvoted   Because the leftists refuse to let conservatives even have a place to share thoughts with one another  so they  39 re brigading like never before.  Weak minded folks who  39 d rather silence dissenting views  rather than debate said views.  Squeeze out the very last drops  Dude  they  39 ll be using that shit for the next 4 years or so. Any little bad thing that happens will be  quot Trump  39 s fault  He caused this when he was in office. quot  Nothing will be Bidens or the Dems fault. But bet your ass anything good that happened during Trump  39 s term they will take credit for and make sure everyone knows how they  39 re basically superheros.  Tbh  i don t want him to run 2024  he is too old then and can t shut his mouth. I would like DeSanctis and Noem as a duo  or Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley running for 2024. No RINOs anymore  they should go to irrelevancy.  Cruz Hawley is a guaranteed loss come on now  This probably has more to do with Republicans in the House. This seems like a  quot you  39 re either with us or against us quot  kind of thing and they want it on the record.  As dumb as that sounds...it s all about  the moral high ground  not what s best for this country during COVID  I feel like letting him just fade out would be a more effective strategy  instead they just keep him relevant by pissing off his base.  His base is going nowhere regardless. This i guarantee.  Trump is now the GOP king maker if the GOP pulls their head out of their ass and rallies around a Trump backed candidate that fights to MAGA. If not  Trump gets to piss all over both parties and fund tech and media companies that compete directly with the establishment.  I sincerely hope he dedicates part of the remainder of his life to unraveling the unbelievably corrupt media system in this country.  Hopefully Musk is on our side as well.  He ll lose benefits including paid travel and secret service detail if he s impeached  the left wants him to suffer at all costs  Well you re wrong he can be impeached in the house if he s not convicted in the Senate it s a irrelevant.  Remember he s already been impeached  He was already impeached. Impeached and removed are two separate issues  one in the house  one made final in the senate. So if the GOP wants to give Democrats a super majority in the senate they won  39 t allow more than a few Romney type Republicans to cross the line to fail in the Senate vote. Mitch apparently won  39 t even take it up a vote  he  39 s still thr majority leader in the senate until Biden is sworn in. Democrats can vote when they have the majority  they still need more than a simple majority in the senate to finalize an impeachment.  I love how they think taking paid travel away from Trump will impact his life in any significant way.   If they impeach and convict him he can t run in 2024. That s the real goal.  I hope he doesn t run in 2024 tbh  He  39 ll be 80 by then  I don  39 t think he will plan on running.  78  He  39 s too old  and as much as I  39 ve liked him he will only bring back angry and divisive thoughts from 2020. I hope the GOP goes the direction he  39 s shoved it in  but I  39 d like to see him call it a day and comment on it instead of muddying up the 2024 primaries.  Why  He stands the best chance at winning by far.  He  39 d be 78 in 2024. I  39 m not comfortable having someone that old in the office. I already heavily doubt Biden will even finish out his term.  Sure  but the guy is divisive as shit and he ll be 82      I don t want him at that age in office  we sit here and call Biden too old but cheer on Trump in 2024. This guy has no place in office anymore. I liked a lot of his stances but I m done with him after this year. If 2020 never happened he d be back in office but this year he shat his place in history so hard. I m ready for someone to come in and lead in a more presidential way. I don t want Ted Cruz either. He s a blow hard.  He would be 78 not 82. He would be the same age as biden now  My apologies  got my ages mixed up  I ve voted for him twice  and would likely do it a third time  and I do agree with you  but I think occasionally he runs his mouth and it benefits the democrats and hurts the Republican party  It  39 s cute they think America will be in a position to hold an election in 2024.  He will still have secret service lmao   They re delusional. Nixon still had it after watergate   Bush is a war criminal and he s still got it.  Trump will always have it from now until the day he dies.  They can kiss their false hopes goodbye  Well Nixon resigned. He wasn t removed.  Nixon didn  39 t actually get impeached tho  he resigned  Wouldn  39 t be allowed to run upon a conviction that explicitly prohibits it.  Curious... As if they  39 re doing it to remove his security detail in hopes he is assassinated.  No need for curiosity  I d bet that a majority of leftists would jump for joy if he was assassinated  They would dance in the streets.  Then tell everybody else to stay inside forever and social distance.  And be celebrated on social media without censorship...  Is that true  Every past United States president is provided in secret service for security purposes. They all have knowledge of the government and its highest levels and must be protected. They can  39 t just take it away.  Makes no sense. He s been impeached so was Bill Clinton. Even if he s Removed from office I think they give it to him. That s a bullshit narrative they re running   Nixon had and then said he didn t want them anymore after the watergate bullshit.  They re not gonna allow Trump without secret service  especially him out of all presidents lmao  See  a normal human would agree with you  but this is the left we re talking about  they want blood and retribution  an impeachment would also stop him from hypothetically running in 2024  which I guarantee they are afraid of  Yes that s what they re more worried about.   Senate Republicans won t proceed cause they will lose even more of their own voter base but Trump out of all former presidents will likely even have more agents by his side. If he decides let s say to go to New York to his tower for a week. That s on fifth avenue with all these people around. They ll be protecting other innocent people as well. Mar a Lago has people that go there in Palm Beach  all the elites live so both parties would worry  they re not taking the chance for innocent people to be harmed too. It s more than just protecting him in this situation.  He can pay for his own private detail but secret service is just way better. They won t be able to strip him of it.  I think this is more pile on. The Democrats are so angry  probably because all through his presidency he out played them   they want to humiliate him. They want blood his and his supporters. They want to destroy him and his supporters. This is about hate.  hate and logic are inversely proportional.  if he is impeached AND convicted.  If true and they succeeded in removing his secret service details  they  39 ll ramp up  even more  the rhetoric against him. Then wait and hope someone goes after him.  They don  39 t want him to run in 2024.  Can confirm. I m enraged. More at Republicans letting this happen. Still enraged.  You  39 re assuming that Democrats are happy with the current amount of power that they  39 re going to receive  but they aren  39 t. The past few days have been one of the most blatant power grabs in US history. This is something that isn  39 t supposed to happen here  but it is  This goes to show the continuous mental health issues Democrat politicians have. It  39 s impossible to start and finish an impeachment before he leaves office.  The only reason they want to impeach Trump a second time is so he goes down in the history books as a failed president  being impeached twice. It s so future generations know the  horrible  presidency of Trump and conservatism.  Yeah they  39 re trying to do their best to cook the books as much as they can. I  39 m interested to see what my 2 year olds are going to learn about him in high school US history  even if I can provide them better than public school.  Democrats need to remember almost half of all voters who voted  voted for him.  Russemen polling shows Trump UP since Jan 6th.  They do but they don  39 t care. They  39 re staunch believers in the tyranny of the majority.  Yeah exactly. If they could make it so only NYC  LA and Chicago could vote  they would.  Mcconnell has already said he  39 s not even going to look at this until after Trump is already out of office.  Clearly this is all political theater.  What I can  39 t get my head around is why they are bothering to stage the play.  It  39 s certainly not going to help solve anything.   Is there really any political advantage to doing this   They are about to have FULL control. If they pack the SCOTUS even more so. That have nothing to lose by trying to rile us up more and by appeasing their ravenous dogs.  Republicans need to draft articles of impeachment against Biden and his ties to China.  They wont because they  39 re a bunch of fucking pussies.  You want Harris to be president   The Dems would jump on the opportunity   A harris presidency would be a disaster for the Dems. No one likes her  The progressives would love it  The progressives didn  39 t get out to vote for her  and their insane radicalism turns off moderates. Biden won the nomination for a reason  he was the least radical one on the stage  They didn t vote for kamala because they preferred other radicals like Bernie and Warren  but Kamala is still much closer to their beliefs than Biden will ever be. Leftists act like they got a victory cause Trump is out  but the sad reality is that Biden was the last thing they wanted.  Thats why i think the two party system has failed. Democrats with their current leadership can t satisfy progressives  while GOP is failing to represent right wingers. I think a multi party system should be coming.  LOL....I think Harris will let  quot nature run its course quot  for about 6 months. I got a shiny new nickle says she  39 s The Boss by Sept 1st   What exactly are his ties to China  The laptop thing    removed   Part of me thinks they  39 re only doing this to keep the MSM and Lefties looking in one direction.   I used to call them the MSM as well  I think a more fitting name is the democrat media establishment  The DME. I like it.  So I asked about this a wile back in a flare only post and got an answer from  a href   u callmesalticidae  u callmesalticidae  a  in my DM.  In this case  I feel it  39 s more symbolic. I don  39 t believe they  39 ll be able to get the 2 3 vote to convict anyway.  The reason for impeachment is to prevent Trump from being able to run for President in 2024.   Thank the good Lord they  39 re not wasting time on those pesky COVID19 relief bills anymore. Maybe some of the Americans who  39 ve lost jobs and livelihoods can just eat the articles of impeachment  or burn them to keep warm.  They  39 re scared. Trump and his base has only grown stronger.  And angrier   removed   Be prepared for false flags and distractions.  I  39 m starting to wonder if the intention is to goad us to the point they think they can declare martial law.  I  39 m really curious how the top brass feel about all this. I know your average enlisted soldier leans right.  So glad we are wasting tax payer dollars on this.  s  Hate filled to the end. Typical of fascists.  What a bunch of petty scumbags.  okay but why are they even doing this if he isn  39 t being re elected  It makes no sense whatsoever  They had their chance but laid down after Trump committed a war crime by assassinating Soleimani.  7th time s the charm  I can t even watch the news anymore    Now he s going scorched earth...  Waste of time and money but OK...  They couldn  39 t wait until the 20th for Trump  39 s presidency to end 
t3_ku7ri3,The Great Purge Expands As CNN Sets Its Sights On Fox News Cable Providers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku7ri3/the_great_purge_expands_as_cnn_sets_its_sights_on/,Funny  Fox made their bed and now their  base  won t fight for them when this happens. I m more concerned about Parler than the faux mainstream media wars.  True  but I m worried about people like tucker and hannity.   deleted   I do like Watters and specially his watters world segment  Tucker is the only one I actually enjoy listening to on Fox.  Don t be this childish. Fox is still way better than any left media. It would be a big loss for us if we lose Fox.   Fox made their bed. Now they can lay in it.  I understand many people are angry at Fox. The way we have acted has been very short sighted. The anger is wreaking us. The left is laughing at our infighting. If Fox is gone  we wouldn t even have partial representation in MSM. Our voice would be sidelined even more. How is it good for the right   This how the RINOs stay in power   by FUD arguments. The 75M people who voted for Trump aren t going to change their minds. The good news anchors at Fox aren t going away. Kill Fox and support other conservative orgs. If one is gone the others will rise.  RINOs stay in power because we didn t fight enough in the primaries. We need to have more people to run for offices.   This is temporary and we will eventually come out strong. I don  39 t see how we can get stronger without ridding of all the RINOs.  Forreal  why is everyone so mad at fox   Because they called Arizona super early   Chris Wallace s moderation of one of the debates was the last straw for me.  Remember when Democrats at least pretended to support freedom of speech   Even pretending  actually hasnt been for quite a long time.  For all the moderates and the liberals   So I logged on looking for help  and was unable to speak.  Maybe Fox news should play the riots in CNN  39 s lobby on a loop.  May as well go out with a bang  CNN is committing suicide here   they wont exist when this is all over.  The whole  quot far left narrative quot  business model only worked as long as trump was in. I predict immediate dropoff in ratings  No  its going to step up to cover for the Atrocities that biden amp co are going to perpetrate.  That might not be a bad thing. Good riddance CNN. And to think I used to think it was the more balanced one of the three.  They can silence the voice all they want. Eventually  it will just be people walking around  silently resenting and hating them. They will have no conservative views to be outraged about  because they won t be present anywhere. When they need to feed their anger addiction  and there are no conservatives to direct that anger to  they ll start turning on each other worse than we ve seen them do already.   Let Fox fight by themselves. Don t help them.  If you need any more evidence that this purge was premeditated  look at Fox s massive  self destructive swing to centre as proof that they were planning to avoid the banwave from at least six months ago.  Are they trying to accelerate cord cutting   FOX showed its true colors during the election  so it really doesn t bother me if they get censored  The murdoch  39 s celebrated when Biden was elected  let their precious news station and the wealth disappear. No love lost here.  Pulling the plug on Fox News would be the best scenario possible for us.  No   having CNN  39 s pulled would be actually better   one less lying propaganda mill helping America  39 s enemies  Fox can go for all I care  When I saw the riots at the Capitol I tried to turn on Fox News  it was the only channel on Comcast XFinity that was not working. Didn t have access to it all day. Worked fine on Thursday  then when news broke about Trump being kicked off Twitter permanently  again no access to Fox News. I m not a big believer in conspiracies  but now I m starting to wonder.  strange that that happened.  Not that I ever saw  Lets see what the leftists will do in their hatred to everything that wont kowtow to them.

Break up FB and Twitter  Let  39 s see who has the last laugh.  They can either be   The issue is that they  39 re claiming they  39 re removing illegal activity when it  39 s not illegal. They  39 ll claim they  39 re acting within the ACT 230 regulations  I mean it is a commie censoring it. But instead of Chinese it s a squirrelly little fuck who got bullied as a kid and is taking it out on republicans  They  39 ll ban him next for saying that.  It  39 s definitely getting there. Soon everyone will need to use a VPN.  How would a VPN have helped in Trump  39 s case    deleted   Guess we leave our phones at home and meet in person.

Here it was Trump breaking Twitter  39 s TOS.  Bullshit  he literally said to be peaceful.  They didn  39 t delete that video in time for people not to catch it.  Always makes me laugh.  Breaking their  quot TOS quot   Well if things really run amuck we may find out first hand.  Why would China care if people are purchasing things  They care about power  not money.  Nothing was mentioned about China  I am referring to car insurance or food or merchants that advertise there.  Facebook and twitter are Chinese puppets. Do you really think they aren  39 t aware that Twitter will go bankrupt without trump  Money is not important to them.  Because it is.  Keep at it Dems. Keep it going.

I would laugh if he resigned and West Virginia voted him back as a write in. It won t happen  but reality can be stranger than fiction.  Murcowski won as a write in after she lost in the republican primary. I think this was in 2010.  What  39 s the difference between Mordor and the Capitol   This is a bad look  isn t it   Oh no not the optics.  Optics matter when someone is in a position of leadership.  One of the most fundamental rules is   em perception is reality.  em   Corporate CEO  39 s know this.  The night manager at Burger Barn knows this.

He was just stupid.  Lol and yet were there not some lefty politicians that got away with calling for and participating in riot activity  I will have to look  grilling dinner lol   this is why we lose we throw our guys to the wolves because we care about optics  it doesn  39 t matter because the other side that controls almost all the optic media hates our guts. I wish you guys would understand that.  So then how do you beat a foe that is not playing by the same ruleset. We didn  39 t beat the Japanese by playing nice with them.   You re acting like the people that  stormed the Capitol  weren t completely incompetent and impotent in sustaining anything of coherence and substance.  No they were stupid  they did the wrong thing.

It  39 s very likely he will either invest in a social media platform or media outlet  or create them  and he will remain a voice on the national stage for the foreseeable future. The guy is a master troll  the left cannot ignore him. They  39 ll want to ignore him but the butthurt will be far  far too strong.  My fear is that they  39 ll try to bankrupt him through investigation after investigation when he  39 s out of office. Bankrupt him monetarily  bankrupt him morally  bankrupt him emotionally  bankrupt his time so he can  39 t tend to his businesses or family...any man would have caved and removed themselves from this world if they had to deal with even a fraction of what President Trump has been through. I pray and wish for protection over him both physically  amp  mentally in the coming years.

You re about to meet your maker maybe it s time to start acting in accordance   She is  sadly  probably convinced that there is nothing after this life.  I pray that she sees the light while still in her time of grace.  It will be interesting to see if Democrats will keep getting away with this once the specter of Orange Man Bad is gone.  They will. Even more so than they do now.  In Animal Farm  they used the previous leader as a scapegoat for a very long time afterwards. There was a supposed attacked on their windmill and they blamed him  only to later revise history as it being the new boogyman.   quot This must be the work of Snowball  quot     The  quot work of quot   and yes.  Fixed thx  During the Obama administration  they were still blaming Bush for everything during the second term.  All to distract from Obama expanding the wars  sending money to those who pay bounties on our troops  arming terrorists  etc.  No  it won  39 t. Hypocrisy is a virtue among the left. The more hypocritical you are  the more you are loved.  She keeps watch over the San Fran homeless from the third story in her 40mill dollar mansion.  For once  For years. Anyone not alienated by her is likely not a liberal  but something far more authoritarian.   May for once   WTF  She should be alienating everyone every time she speaks.

I d rather pay to get a cat out of the humane society.  and why didn  39 t the FBI investigate blm and antifa for burning the cities down   Because they are political hacks  Mostly peaceful protesters.  Might as well start listing all the possibilities of what could have happened and investigate it.  When did the FBI become such a weapon of the left    They  39 ve been for a while now. It just didn  39 t become blatantly obvious until Trump got in office  Do you know the history  Law enforcement is usually a conservative field...  Clearly not at a federal level after eight years of Obama hires.  Correct  the FBI has always been aligned with the establishment. In which you get people like Comey and Mueller in the bush era.  Establishment natural leans left  After Obama agency got the silent go ahead to target political enemies as long as they kept off the records.

t3_ktqqk1,CNN Calls Tucker Carlson a Parasite Over His Coverage of Chaos at the Capitol,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ktqqk1/cnn_calls_tucker_carlson_a_parasite_over_his/,Let me guess Brian Stelter started crying on air    deleted   That shit was hysterical. Say what you will about Tucker Carlson but his writing staff and his delivery is on point. And they say conservatives aren  39 t funny.  So  CNN is a tabloid. They say crazy shit all the time. Why is this news   Batboy retro revival on CNN by 2022  I don  39 t think anyone of any intelligence actually believes CNN is credible  The average person is living their life. They turn on whatever news they are watching and pretty much assume they are telling the truth. If they didn  39 t believe places like CNN  Joe Biden wouldn  39 t be able to show his face in public let alone be days away from the presidency.  Tucker s response to the Capitol Hill riot is identical to the response that many people in the left wing media as well as many politicians in the Democratic Party had to the BLM riots.  The difference is Tucker actually blamed the people who committed the violence. He even called out Trump specifically by calling him reckless.  Most of us dumped Fox News on election night  including watching Tucker. He waffles back and forth on support for conservatives.  Fox screwed the pooch  and their viewership is down 30 50 . They  39 re done  and they know it.  We ll see where their ratings are by the midterms. I think it s natural after losing an election to want to turn off the news. My parents watched NewsMax for a couple weeks but now don t watch anything because it s  too depressing . My guess is that has more to do with the ratings decline than anything. I recall tuning out the news after Obama won. It wasn t until the Tea Party gained momentum that I became interested again. I think we ll see something similar.  Don  39 t think so. I peruse many pro conservative sites  social media  websites  Rumble. A majority of post Fox watchers will never go back. Democrats walk away to join Republican party  but not the other way around.  They feel betrayed and will never go back. After the Fox election night debacle  we cut the cable cord. Never going back either. The groups i work with will work tirelessly to oust radical Dems and RINO Republicans.  2022 is going to surprise many  in many ways.  If they don t work within the Republican Party  they will just ensure Democratic victories. Also  they have to be very careful about who they choose to primary with. Remember Christine O Donnell  Roy Moore   You can  39 t be serious. Burning innocent people  39 s businesses  murdering people including an 8 year old child  hurting over 1000 police officers  some murdered .  Great comment. At the end of the day we all supported BLM protests just not riots. We might not have agreed with the premise but supported their right  they feel their rights were oppressed  they have the right to protest.   Pretty sure he  39 s talking about the perception of fraud... And those people don  39 t believe that there is no proof... Just like BLM doesn  39 t believe that all cops aren  39 t racist murders  There s a legal reason the lawyers were afraid to claim fraud. The rules of civil procedure place special requirements on allegations of fraud. They require a higher burden of proof and sanctions can be placed on the lawyers if they don t meet the heightened requirements of pleading fraud. The lawyers were  em afraid  em  of pleading fraud because of the potential career consequences. There was evidence of fraud  but perhaps not enough that a lawyer could feel comfortable pleading it. This should not be surprising because it typically takes months if not years to gather evidence to build a fraud case.  Why was this downvoted   Tucker summed up my position pretty well. And I think had the general notion been that it was peaceful  it was except for some acts of violence and destruction which of course is terrible   then I think more would come out in support of a peaceful occupation. But of course  even saying they had the right to be in DC will get you banned  Thank you for laying the out distinction  or lack thereof  between BLM idiots in  insert riot location  and the MAGA idiots at the Capitol succinctly.  Well said. The claim that the two violent protests  aren t the same  is demonstrably false. They are exactly the same  it just depends on which side of the argument you re on.  What does that make Don Lemon for his BLM coverage   I m sure he s considered brave and courageous for speaking in what he believes in.  So funny how everyone says stand up for what you believe in  until they don t like what you believe in.  I mean  he is a parasite. If anyone here think  39 s he  39 s a genuine conservative  you haven  39 t been watching him very long. He has rebranded himself more than once.   This sub has really going downhill when nonsense like this get upvoted. Carlson has always been conservative. He was a Ron Paul supporter in 1988 and has maintained a consistent conservative worldview ever since.  I ve noticed a massive shift in sentiment here.  well one thing  39 s for sure  the real conservatives are not death cultists who do an insurrection with nazis in the fuckin ranks. my grandfather was an ardent conservative and religious man  and he fought the nazis in ww2. my father and uncles all fought the commies in korea and vietnam.   This is some impressive gatekeeping  I  39 ll give you that.  I mean shit  if we  39 re going to gatekeep anyone  it should be the Nazis.  Love your flair.  This isn  39 t true.  He  39 s been pretty much the same since at least 2004 or so.  Hes a paleoconserve same as trump  that just more conservative than others.  Why isn t this kind of trolling outlawed in this thread   I am simply espousing traditional centrist conservative views and making posts against zealous extremism. If you think that  39 s trolling  maybe you should find a place more suited to snowflakes.  You are about respecting the constitution but you attack one of the few popular mainstream conservative news anchors that still does.  Fox is not my ally  nor is it yours.  Who else is there then    We have lost all ability to think rationally or dismiss insane correlations. Major cities burned  30  killed and absolutely no consequences for those in politics or media who either excused or defended such vile actions. One day of violence by the same ideological crazies of their party and our betters have ranked it far and above anything ever committed in modern history.  I  39 m starting to think that letting the left hide behind free speech and freedom of the press my whole life was a big mistake. We didnt realise they didn  39 t actually believe in these things themselves  It was just the argument of the day meant to empower themselves and shame conservatives who didn t like their radical speech at the time. Well their radical speech led to their party s mainstream appeal.   WOW  A  quot parasite  quot  That  39 s high praise coming from CNN.  The Nazis did this. Jews were parasites  insects  worms  Joe Biden is such a scumbag he goes off on a rant about people credulously believing lies and follows it up with a whopper.  I feel bad for him sometimes. Too many stories to keep straight. He mixes everything up. 25  no I mean 250 000  yes 25 million  they published 25. 250  come on man            i see dead people. they  39 re voting  Why do the zombies have Biden Harris signs in one hand and brains in the other  How delightfully unusual.  I saw this movie  The progressives joined hands with their new zombie friends. Not realizing zombies will always be zombies.  There was clearly fraud  but there wasn  39 t 80 million votes worth.  How could most know what was in their best interest with the MSM spoon feeding what they heard and learned   You first sentence actually answers itself.   Try being me   About 100k votes in 3 states flipped the election. GA  10k  AZ  10k  and take your pick of one other swing state.  Did CNN somberly ask themselves if it was time to revaluate their relationship with left wing action groups  blindly parroting their narratives  when an 8 year old girl was shot and killed by  quot protestors quot  occupying a street during the summer riots in Atlanta  Did they ask what they could have done as an organization to encourage peace and turn down the temperature  Of course not  because the media makes the most out of anything when the dials are turned up.   Tucker fucking destroys them every show.  CNN is the loser kid with no good comebacks.  Trump is going to wish that he declassified everything right after the Mueller report. The left is going to show Republicans how to weild power. Just like Obama did behind the scenes.  Corpo Fascist speak  harking back to times when dictators ruled and disappeared their own people.  Oh no    CNN is a parasite for their coverage of everything.  This is Third Reich level propaganda  call your political enemies   39 parasites  39 .  Fox News should have unironically used the exact headlines that the mainstream left wing media news used to describe the protests.  quot Rambunctious  but mostly peaceful. quot   How dare this guy criticize us  He must be removed   This is targeted language...its intended to dehumanize the target so that people accept violence against them.   If CNN hates you  you  39 re likely a moral person. Them  NY times  etc   if they like you  you  39 re probably an ass.  Given I felt like his take the day of was probably the best I ve seen so from a major media figure  I m somehow not surprised they would say that. The part that troubles me is that the more I ve seen since  the more convinced that they either want a war or are too stupid to realize they re going to start one.  Cartoon News Network is an entertainment network.  Their opinion and a dollar will get you a drink at mcdonalds.  Coming from CNN that  39 s a compliment.  CNN is Fascist Central  Well  Tucker  it was a great run  but unfortunately the mob is so emboldened right now that and unless you have something else lined up  you are finished.

Check out  a href   r degoogle  r degoogle  a   Why did you skip Reddit   Isnt bing run by Microsoft   yes but microsoft is been doing less information manipulation.  DDG still the goto though bing is just good if ya wanna avoid google but get a mainstream algorithm.  Microsoft is a middle man. I rarely see anything biased from them. Plus they have a rewards program. So  yeah.  The CEO s of Twitter  Facebook and Google now officially control what information the American people are allowed to see. I bet China even has more than three people in the room when they re doing their banning and censoring.  All 3 are publicly traded  CEO and company Officers  C level execs  report to the Board of Directors.  If actions start having an adverse effect on shareholder value the shareholders can start suing for lack of fiduciary responsibility.  I wouldn  39 t be surprised if there are a lot of emergency Board meetings happening this weekend. If this continues start looking for lawsuits. Hedge funds and big institutional investors  no matter their politics  will start exploring this angle to start acquiring control or make a quick buck.  Making money supercedes politics for these guys.  The USA has officially been revealed as an Oligarchy now.  I did the same.  Was only there to follow these conservatives anyways  I think Levin said he was leaving it also.  They re not a platform  An old man with cancer has more stones than most of us. We  39 re lucky to have Rush Limbaugh on our side.  I really wish he could make a miraculous recovery and continue to live on for many more years.  My heart is not going to be ready for the day Rush does his last broadcast.  The reason we even have a voice at all in media is because of this man.  It was bad enough watching Alex Trebek say goodbye.  I have followed suit  He knows he was next.  A man has got to know his limits

t3_ktuxl8,Conservatives flee to Parler following Twitters permanent suspension of Trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ktuxl8/conservatives_flee_to_parler_following_twitters/,May be a bad idea.  Already taken off Google play.  Apple wants to ban them.  The website is hosted on Amazon servers and there is pressure on Amazon to delete them.  We are thirty seven years late but none the less it  39 s happening.   removed   I remember a time when liberals said Trump blocking someone on Twitter was a violation of the blocked persons First Amendment rights. ACLU even sued to get an injunction to prevent Trump blocking people.   The first amendment guarantees that the GOVERNMENT can  39 t stop free speech. If Trump is the one doing the censoring  it violates the first amendment. When a private company stops someone from speaking on its platform  that  39 s CAPITALISM. You can  39 t force the bakery to bake a cake for the gay couple  REMEMBER  And you can  39 t force a media company to allow or disallow anyone from speaking.  This guy gets it.       No   s he clearly doesn  39 t. POTUS  a government official    a servant of the people  who  39 s paid by our tax dollars  have different obligations than the platform  which is a private company.  What happened 37 years ago   Amazon isn  39 t the only webhosting company.  I know.  Which is weird why they said this   My bet is most of their API is written around some of the custom AWS lambda and EKS stuff that makes it easy to start a backend in a cloud environment. AWS is one of the easiest  quot break in quot  points to cloud hosted platforms. Yeah  others like Oracle  Google  etc. exist  but there  39 s a lot of tailoring to your provider when building out the infrastructure and if the people that originally created it aren  39 t around  there  39 s going to be a huge amount of legacy knowledge about how it was built that just isn  39 t there.   Perhaps they are deep into all the  quot serverless quot  Amazon services that it would be very difficult to move somewhere else.  Using Amazon Web Service allows companies to cut cost because they don t have to take care of the physical servers. If Parler is take off of AWS then they might not have the necessary infrastructure nor funds to host phyla onsite servers.  If they are leveraged to AWS to such an extent that would be a problem for migration. Amazon cost a lot more to pull data off of than to put it on. Honestly bad infrastructure strategy. Things are moving fast. Probably not enough time to negotiate a stand up on another provider assuming they would take them. Parler didn  39 t really set themselves up for success of this is the case.  Or just go to gab  Ye but the other web hosting platforms may not hold the traffic or be based on Amazon. Amazon has no shame in taking the supplier offline and that s why they don t really have the whole world to go to.   Even if you can  39 t access the app  you can still go to the website and make an account.  Yes did you read the rest of that   Use Gab then. They ve already been banned from both App Stores  PayPal  Visa  and cloud hosting providers  so they are running their own infrastructure now.  Amazon just stopped their Internet hosting services.    Don  39 t fret. That will change as well. We can  39 t have conservatives freely voicing their opinions. That wouldn  39 t be fair to the tolerant left.  Then can move to AliCloud.  What is the alternative to Amazon   Aaaaand they are being removed  a href  https   i.imgur.com g4eQ1Td.jpg  rel  nofollow  https   i.imgur.com g4eQ1Td.jpg  a   Not when AWS closes the doors.   deleted   Yeah but Google and Azure are not going to touch them and the smaller providers are going to pass as it could bring them down. AliCloud may become the savior.  Like Alibaba   Yeah they started doing cloud a few years back and have a few data centers in the US. Considering the content that is posted there is no way a European or US host would touch them. We had servers on Halsey street in Newark and the FBI got a warrant one day and took 4 racks from a neighboring colo back in 2007. No host is going to want to deal with that. With IaaS it is both a lot simpler as well as more complex but in the en d there is no arguing with the feds.  Welp  Amazon has pulled the plug. Tomorrow at midnight Parler is dead.  Just Cancelled Amazon and all Services and got my refund immediately.  quot Every   Matters quot .  Honest question. If parler gets shut down and this sub gets banned where do we go  I think this is what  39 s worrying me alot. Theyre shutting up alarge portion of the country and its happening really fast.  Ruqqus  Gab  and the streets.  I guess it s back to  pol  for some of us.   To the streets. To rallies. Organize. Youre not a violent racist if you tell me you arent  I belive you. We used to give people the benefit of the doubt. We used to have to PROVE someone guilty.    a href  https   www.androidpolice.com 2020 08 14 how to download apps without the play store and why apkmirror is the best place to get them   https   www.androidpolice.com 2020 08 14 how to download apps without the play store and why apkmirror is the best place to get them   a   Yeah.. barrier of entry is high for a lot of people  even though it  39 s pretty easy .  Also if they are booted from Amazon they already said they are done.  Nope  APK Mirror nuked it too.  Mastodon.  You should try gab they ve built their own servers and a bunch of people are joining  Have fun talking to yourselves  chimps  That s honestly all they need want to do anyway  Parler CEO stated they do have a backup plan if AWS removes them.  Well when they remove them.  Nah  hatred...... finds away.  I wonder if more people are realizing how fucked this is.  And it s gone  apple make there iPhones worse by not letting thing be on the app store  This is what happens when too many people on your platform start threatening violence after some committed violence at the Capitol.  Do you not remember a time before social media   Just because social media exists doesn t give you a right to use it.  If I go into a store and break the rules they will kick me out.  Deactivate your accounts before you flee. Their falling numbers will affect their stock price. They care about money. Not freedom  Also make sure you invoke your CCPA eight to have all your data deleted  especially if you live in California.  Not only will this be a pain for them but it will also reduce their value.  In todays market who actually knows what can really reduce value. There is a fundamental disconnect.  You  39 re a genius    Make sure you do it with Facebook and all the others as well.  Will do  thanks    How does one do that  Haven t occasion to worry about it before.  They are supposed to make it easy and obvious per the law.  Search for ccoa with company name.  If you can  39 t find it  contact support.  I tried finding I. Twitter but voukd not find so I had to send message to support.    Could you make a post with the info when you find out   That ll show em  This just deleting the app won t fully help although daily active users will go down  Boycott it totally. Delete your account  and do not go on it whatsoever. They profit everytime you look at an ad  Could we all just short there stocks and see the valuation fall   That  39 s not enough  Twitter is a private company. Can you blame them   Yeah I can blame them for trying to disrupt and manipulate our democratic process  The question was about their concerns about profit.  My bad. What I would like to see is the share holders turn on the CEO perpetuating this mass censorship  Unless it helps popularity  in which case this is the right thing to do for the shareholders. Realistically  the amount of conservatives that will leave Twitter will be small.  Potentially 71 million people leaving a social media platform would hurt it. Remember Myspace   Perhaps  because that  39 s over 20  of all users and about half of the daily users  since it  39 s a somewhat small platform. Where does that number come from  though   The election  Only 330million people use Twitter  an international platform  of which only 68.7 million are American. All of those would have to be Trump supporters for that to be true  and boycott it together. But if we assume proportions are the same as the election  for the sake of simplicity  then  47  support Trump  so  32 million people  in that case. A large number  but in reality is likely to be much lower proportion of people leaving than even that.   removed   I spent about 10 minutes on there earlier.  And it  39 s gone  Something everyone needs to understand     The more users they get the better their revenue. The better their revenue the more their UI will improve.  Looks like they are done as well.  FLEE  your rats  FLEE   No offense  but Reddit is doing it too...  Yeah  ever since 2018 2019 this place is a leftist wasteland...  It s such a shame. As soon as I post anything even mildly disagreeing with a left opinion  I m downvoted into oblivion and then receive comments with word gymnastics from liberals that really say nothing of value. I know every time I post something  I m gonna get hit for it  but I post anyways. I just found this sub and I m glad to have found it  and a non flair post too  lol .  Why would I be offended by that  Reddit is shit.  But what if Amazon kicks Parler off their servers   Others are making it sound like Parler can  39 t move to other servers  but I don  39 t understand why not   It  39 s called tech lock in. I don  39 t use Parler but am a tech junkie and have multiple customers on AWS. AWS offers many services which can be used to build huge  impressively functional sites  tech ecosystems  or private systems. But  many of those services AWS offers are not available or not in the same form on other providers such as Azure  Google Cloud  etc. Porting an AWS centric system to another IaaS PaaS etc provider is no easy feat and can be quite expensive. It all depends upon the technical designers of Parler.   a href  https   www.washingtonpost.com technology 2021 01 09 amazon parler suspension   rel  nofollow  https   www.washingtonpost.com technology 2021 01 09 amazon parler suspension   a   They might not have the staff  infrastructure  or funds necessary to host physical servers.  Even if they did  if they don  39 t have a CDN to make the access and delivery of data fast  efficient  and scalable they  39 re toast. Here are some of the biggest CDNs   Sounds like Parler needs to learn what websites like Piratebay went thru years ago. Things like distributed servers in various countries.  The should license out the use of their api like Twitter did originally to gain popularity. Then someone else can do the work and apps will get better.  Become a verified Parler Citizen  today   A less moderated social media platform would be great  but Parler stinks. Looks like something I would have made on Geocities in 2003.  You d think with so much investments from conservative multimillionaires  Parler should be well polished. But no it s amateurish and looks outdated. The money is clearly being pocketed.  You can  39 t expect it to be as sophisticated as the big platforms overnight. If you go look at early YouTube or Facebook you can see how they  39 ve evolved.  Early Facebook and YouTube were pioneers in social media.  Twitter is not a complicated website to create . And half decent Dev team could knock up a Twitter clone in a month at most.  I don  39 t like it either  but until somebody comes up with something better  we are stuck.  Wouldn t something so outdated and lacking make you think it is easier to hack and exploit your data   Like I said  as soon as somebody comes up with something better I  39 ll leave.  This didn t age well and it s only been a day  Unfortunately this will not help.  Parler is in the crosshairs.  They need to go the pirate Bay route and host in free countries  There are free countries   I don t even use Twitter but I made a Parler account today just to support them. The only language companies ever understand is their bottom line so tipping the scale a little bit is one of the few things we can do that will actually hurt them.  Agreed I did the same. I still have Twitter but I will delete my account as well Facebook and most likely Instagram as well. I m done with the censoring.  Go to gab they have their own servers  Good thing I got Gab too I guess.   quot Flee quot . More like packed up and left. If Twitter wants to reduce its user base by 1 2  good luck to them.  I ve never been a big fan of Twitter and neither is anyone else that I know. Tbh  I think one of the only things that kept it relevant and going over the last few years was Trump tweets.  In fairness  I would be willing to bet it s 3 to 1 leftist to everyone else to begin with.  Actually it  39 s mostly bots  Isn  39 t that what I said ...  Don  39 t worry  Jeff Bezos is already working on removing their AWS servers because Parler won  39 t install AI surveillance bots that scrape all your user data and hand it over to the Tech Cartel.  Don  39 t...you give parler your ID to set up an account   And..social security number   I didn t need either  FAKE NEWS  Ban all those of a certain political persuasion and echo chambers abound.  And now they target Parler on google and apple.  They may not get to far  it  39 s being reported that Amazon will end hosting Parler on Sunday.   January 10th   Okay while I understand I guess why this was taken off the AppStore  I guess. This is a blatant violation of free speech. And even if it was for trying to achieve silence it s just going to make those people more angry. Silenced people will always find away  how our nation started   Now  if Parler can just manage to migrate to their own servers  they may make it through this shit storm.  Welcome to an Orwellian dystopia with China as the worlds hegemonic country. We re fucked  That ended well.  Guys  the US and its telecom industry are not going to allow terrorist communication platforms to operate. They  39 ve been exposed. You can hop off of one app to another  but the app platform can refuse to host the app and any existing ones  i.e. Discord  are now extremely open to legal action. Okay  we  39 ll just use the web instead of mobile apps. Amazon will cut their servers. Get around that  ATT Comcast Verizon etc. remove your access to the pipes. Completely cut off from the stream. Sure  you can manage to get around that  but by that point you  39 re so underground that you  39 re impossible to find for the average person and irrelevant. Even then  the FBI and NSA are scraping every single layer in the mix. It  39 s a little ironic since it  39 s the GOP who are the ones who created all of these stop gaps by killing net neutrality  expanding NSA reach  etc.  I  39 ve watched BLM and Antifa literally burn cities to the ground for the past 6 months  but ya sure  we  39 re the fucking terrorists because we believe in free speech and don  39 t like companies going out of their way to censor us.   deleted   People on the left are mocking people who say this is a attack on first amendment rights to free speech because  its in the TOS   it s a private company    I ve seen nonames with blue check marks on Twitter saying that if the entire right leaves and goes to Parler then Parler will just be an echo chamber and I m thinking isn t that most likely what will happen to Twitter as well   like if your platform only houses one view then you re basically an echo chamber. They created this divide and they want it to stay that way.  You re right that happens in any situation especially the internet and social media platforms. If you don t allow the free flow of ideas and block everyone you disagree with it does become a echo chamber.   This is an underappreciated additional downside to conservatives moving to their own platform. Both sides get more siloed and might be expected to become worse for lack of the alternate perspective.   If it didn  39 t have a lot of  quot flaired users only quot  this sub would turn into r politics and just be a left wing circlejerk. Even if you think it  39 s a right wing circlejerk  I feel it is more open   it  39 s nice to have some variety.  That  39 s the problem in social media. Silencing the minority   silencing opposing views is just too easy. Subs can limit who can talk based of political views and race. Echo chambers just breed hard headed people closed off to any other views.  Reddit is the worst for this with the way being downvoted ends with your post being hidden.  There is a huge difference here and I think you should go check out Parler to see exactly what these people are actually saying on that platform.  Oh I agree completely that Parler is full of garbage.  I dont have flair and I agree with policy  otherwise it would be every other sub on reddit. The reason youre here is because you can actually SEE and READ something other than an echo chamber. Thats because of the way this sub is moderated. Or you can go to  a href   r woodworking  rel  nofollow  r woodworking  a  and get bombarded with wooden fuck trump signs. This is the only free thinking sub on reddit.  Most of these  quot disagreements quot  are hate speech  threats  and brigades. Ya know  the kind of actions that SHOULD have you banned from a platform.  That  39 s what Trump and conservatives are doing twitter banned him  Things must be so cozy your brains. To think im the good guy while I fuel riots  cheer for police deaths  openly support criminals and their organizations  root for terror  fear and inequality  promote racism and openly insult the more intelligent.  Being banned from a subreddit is not even close to the same as being banned from a whole platform.  There is no central  quot Reddit quot . Each subreddit is essentially it  39 s own platform. And again  Twitter is a business and private platform  they  can ban whoever they want  whenever they want  especially when inciting terrorism.  If you re banned by a subreddit  you can move on to the next sub. If you re banned by an entire platform  you ve completely lost your voice there. They are comparatively different.  It  39 s flaired users only because of the amount of brigading this sub has been getting lately.  But that  39 s infringing on my right to free speech  People being downvoted because they said something stupid isn  39 t likely to be brigading. That  39 s something I noticed in many threads   someone would say something mind bendingly stupid and get downvoted for it  as they would anywhere on Reddit  but the excuse that followed was always  quot  em We  39 re being brigaded   em  quot . Not a single time did I ever see anyone ever reflect that perhaps what they said was the issue  not that it  39 s people coming in from elsewhere and arbitrarily downvoting comments. It  39 s like some perverse addiction to a victim complex.  Half the comments here are just   39 here comes the brigade quot ... Which I down vote  with the others  because it adds absolutely nothing to any convo and is whiney... Then they post another comment about  quot really  Downvoting   39   but i personally believe companies have that right. i run a small business and i do not use they them pronouns  i dont provide my products at gay weddings  thats my choice  if a company loses their choice then we dont have freedom. let companies choose who and how they want to do business is my opinion.  Or maybe you guys should stop betting on the wrong horse.  Bye bye Parler     Speak with your wallet. Hitting them where their money is  stocks  sends a pretty big message.  Patriots still in control.   It  39 s mindblowing to me that the left   those who believe that one should have the freedom to express their gender any way they see fit  regardless of any biological or sociological data that might conflict with that expression    can simultaneously hold a position where certain people can  39 t express their political opinions  which are way less important than basic biological facts  because it doesn  39 t align with their mob mentality  just made an account there. i really hope that apps like this can thrive.  It  39 s funny. I  39 ve never had a Twitter account.    removed   The one things conservatives need to learn to do is work with common action for common purpose.  Parler will be removed from AWS but then they will acquire their own servers and be back up. We should all sign up on gab and clouthub.com  Capitalism has the habit of providing service where there  39 s demand. There will soon start being competition for the right wing clients   gonna be interesting  Unwise. There are nameless people seeking to distill that same extremism that brought a politically disastrous coup. These sorts of niche spaces can be a part of how that happens. Though worse than this was almost certainly the manipulative narrative control measures showcased by TD.  To many bad pictures and death threats. Death threats have gotten out of control.  Quote of the day from republican congresswoman Rep.

Fun trick I thought of today....start following them on reddit.  Reddit allows followers to be anonymous  and since most of these turds keep advocating for violence  the more followers they have  the larger their perceived audience.  Thank you. Now I have a new subreddit to follow.  We should defeat classic car clubs to eliminate drunk driving.   Genuinely excited to see this geriatric commie try.  The last four years all we heard were accusations of being Nazis and oppressing people while they call for bombs and assassinations. Biden isn t even inaugurated yet and they re on a mass purge spree silencing opposing views  big tech is after the first amendment  Biden is going after the second. Oppress the people  silence and disarm the population. Very Nazi esque.   Out of my cold dead hands  He can certainly try  he won  39 t be successful though...  Joe Biden thinks AR stands for assault rifle. He also thinks that the Red Ryder BB gun he asked for for Christmas in 1950 is still coming.  The majority of shills on here probably think the same way.    THE SECOND AMENDMENT WAS MADE FOR MUSKETS  NOT MILITARY GRADE WEAPONS   It s their logic  the party of race hate is still living back in 1791.

Youd think with a conservative super majority we d have no trouble  but I m not sure if they re brave enough to ever take on one of these cases  haha you think that is going to stop them.  If you do not yet own a firearm  but have wanted to  now is the time to read up on what you have to go through to do so and make it happen.  It  39 s bad enough they make you go through what you have to to use your 2nd Amendment as is  they  39 re going to make it harder.  the firearm market is going to be totally fucked for the next decade with where we  39 re going.  Didn  39 t take long for Pelosi and her cohort of anti Constitutionalists to begin trying to shit on our liberties.  The next 2 years are going to be really bad. Republicans better fight. I don  39 t like the GOP  and we need to primary them all out aside from a few  but we still need them unfortunately. They have to fight or we won  39 t be able to fight ever again. Also need some principled Democrats in the House or Senate to stand against some of these more ridiculous agenda items  especially the filibuster and structural stuff like that  I m afraid that despite the rift in the Democrat party  the one thing they will unify over is their distaste for Republicans. Biden s rhetoric lately will provide support for this. They will unite on anything they think will hurt the conservative agenda. I think it s going to be tough to oppose this.  I know I may be naive and stupidly optimistic. But I think this is about as bleak as things are going to get. In less than 2 weeks  the Dems are going to have to actually govern. Right now they are all united in attacking Trump as they  39 ve done the last 4 years.    2022 may be different  but that s still two years worth of governing and law making we have to contend with. The incoming regime and their supporters have proven their willingness to take a pretty aggressive stance towards some topics we are in disagreement over. 2A  immigration  Puerto Rico DC statehood  for example  all topics that would solidify support from their base. Giving them the House  Senate  and Oval Office allows them to fast track the things they know will hurt us most...so I expect them to try to make some pretty significant changes  either by law or executive order.  Filibuster isn  39 t gone yet  and moderate dems won  39 t nuke it unless there is a controversy that gives them cover. I would hope that West Virginia would impeach and remove Manchin immediately if he did something like that  So I disagree that any of those issues you mentioned would truly galvanize their base. I think the Dems and a lot of Conservatives are falsely believing that the priorities of the far left are popular with a lot of Americans. A majority of Americans believe in gun rights. Most do not want open borders. Puerto Rico DC statehood  I don  39 t know tbh how most Americans feel about that.   It basically would lock the senate up permanently for them. You get thst right   Well to do that they have to get rid of the filibuster. I don  39 t see that happening when Manchin  Tester  and Sinema have all gone on record as saying they wouldn  39 t.  Forgive me for not believing anything a member of congress promises me.  That  39 s fair. That being said what I always trust politicians to do is to act in their self interest. I am pretty confident none of those 3  Sinema the least though because of how Arizona is trending  want to be the deciding vote that destroys the filibuster and makes them accountable to their very red states for all the resulting leftist legislation that could pass because of it.  You re obviously the optimist in the room. If they pass amnesty none of it will matter. That ll be the end of conservatism here in America.  I like this take   Shit man there is going to be shooting before the end of this year  I have a feeling that just sitting back  bitching  and voting in 2 years is not going to be enough.  looks like they aren  39 t wasting any time  You missed a couple.   Well fuck.   a href  https   i.imgur.com OmVcS04.jpg  https   i.imgur.com OmVcS04.jpg  a   What does safe storage mean.  Means you need to lock your guns into a safe and keep the bullets and mags away from the gun  mostly in another safe.  Now you know how stupid it is  they want to make gun ownership as hard as possible.  Looks like people are just going to have to start making their own.  As soon as ossoff and warnock  won   we were well and truly fucked. It s the bottom of the ninth  we re down by 3 runs and the bases are loaded  so Trump had better hit a home run in these next 12 days  or sooner if the GA Secretary of State certifies the senators before that  if we want to have any chance of surviving as a nation  because we won t recognize it in two years if not.  Trump already dropped the ga challenges  its over.  He did drop all court challenges  but that doesn t mean there aren t still legal routes available to him. Especially with the treason that has occurred and the blatantly coordinated attack on our freedom of speech.  There is a reason why the supreme court is hearing trumps PA case two days after inauguration because at that point there is nothing that can be done about it.  even if the supreme court rules in favor of trump and it trickles down with similar result for the other states  it doesnt matter.   At that point jan 20th is the firm date and the cases wont be heard till jan 22...  I m not talking about anything relating to the supreme or any other court.  Our only glimpse of hope is the do and it means elections have to be run correctly. Great we have a shot in 2022. However if they ram through DC which they can  39 t by the constitution but that never stopped them. Then and PR bang forever senate majority and likely the house too.  I don  39 t know why we expect a 70  year old man to save us. He did what he could but we all got to see how far the swamp goes  nothing short of a few things is going to change the trajectory of this country.  Long story short  word has it that there s been a lot of Blackhawk chopper movement going on and that trump intends to use the emergency broadcast system for something here shortly. As such  there s also word that Apple intends to turn off the EBS in an imminent update  so if you have an iPhone  turn that there auto update off just incase.  forgive me if I don  39 t hold my breath. You can come back at me and point and say I told you so if something does happen  but I have a hard time believing much right now.  As do I  but lets not throw in the towel until ol  dementia has been sworn in.  I ain  39 t throwin the towel in even when that old dried up prune is sworn in. We have work to do.  Sadly  at that point they will have a streamlined bill to law scenario for each one in a matter of hours with no discussion  compromise or deliberation whatsoever and there ll be nothing we can do to stop them  Your only source for this is Lin Wood  and be hasn  39 t cited a source.  Partially correct  but I never stated it s a fact. Still  better to be prepared than unprepared.  Trump was at Dyess AFB in Abilene following the events on Jan 6. I live in the next town over from Abilene and happened to be there as Air Force One was flying over. Fighter jets  Blackhawks  Apaches and even an Osprey were flying over for hours prior to his arrival and for hours more after his arrival. Those laptops being stolen from a bunch of Dems was not a coincidence. It was a masterfully thought out plan in order to gain access to all of the evidence stored on their laptops. Here s a video breaking a bunch of this down  a href  https   youtu.be  R6q70LTidY  rel  nofollow  https   youtu.be  R6q70LTidY  a   Good to know  thanks for that update   I have no intention of complying.   that  39 s the funniest part of all this. they can  39 t even get blue states to comply with this nonsense. everyone just laughs at them.

Nice to have representatives who don t represent its constituents  Hates Amazon  yet Amazon sticks up for her. Weird. The Democrats are the party of pretending to hate big corporations while having those same corporations on their front lines.  The top 10 wealthiest Americans are all unapologetically liberal Democrat.  They reelected her though.  Let s not forget this is a woman who photographed herself pretending to cry outside an immigration detention center.  Someone stole all her shoes LOL   Even AOC herself  as I said  has demonized both Republicans and police. She called ICE facilities  concentration camps.  Then a far left Antifa guy tried to firebomb an ICE facility in Tacoma  Washington using the inflammatory language of AOC and her Squad in his manifesto. Where is the accountability for that   I  39 m pretty sure from what I  39 ve seen of her she misplaced it a while back  if ever she had it.
t3_ku5abs,Former Obama Adviser Capitol Riots a Worse Security Failure Than 911,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku5abs/former_obama_adviser_capitol_riots_a_worse/,My eyes rolled so far up into my head my testicles got stuck in my throat. I think they might be trying to replace my eyes.  What   You dont think 50 dipshits breaking into the capital building and taking Facebook pictures is worse than highjacking 4 planes  blowing up 2 buildings   HITTING THE FUCKING PENTAGON and murdering every innocent civilian on board    This just shows the low IQ level of Obama administration and these democrats. They did not see any problem BLM took control of  7 blocks in Seattle with hundred of people for weeks. Not a single democrat spoke against this or showed any concerns for those stuck residents in dangerous situation.   That is entirely possible. So who decided to not have security at the Trump rally that we knew about for a month  and then who decided to let them in  We need answers. It  39 s either incompetence or corruption  The  quot rioters quot  were literally taking selfies with the police.  And we have video footage of police officers opening the Capitol doors and escorting  quot rioters quot ... who gave them the ok   hyperbole     h   p r b     l   They are the most dramatic people on earth. Holy shit.  Don t you understand  This is worse than 9 11  Covid  WWII  and the Holocaust put together   s  ok then why the fuck did you let them in  This is the equivalent of a soccer player writhing around on the ground after getting flicked in the ear.  2 996 people that died on 9 11 would say otherwise... Clowns the Democrats.  They are acting like that because it was closer to home for them  Riiiiiigh... t.  Terry Bernadino from Reno 911   I WAS MURDERED   Everything to them is worse then 9 11. Shit they could get a paper cut and that to them is worse then 9 11  Obama advisor... skip  The more I think about the above headline  the more I realize that the left are nothing but little kids larping as adults.  They really do suffer from an arrested development where they have thought patterns similar to that of a five year old child.
t3_kv2zqe,Exactly Where and How Did Trump Incite the Mob  Before the lynch mob gets the noose ready and hangs the president from the nearest tree it would be useful to step back and make sure that he really did what everyone seems to be sure he was guilty of doing.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv2zqe/exactly_where_and_how_did_trump_incite_the_mob/,well  it  39 s trump. of course hes gonna get blamed for it. kimda fcked up though that the dems have been calling for violence since trump  39 s inauguration but they never get blamed for it.  Face it  as far as  governance of this country  evil walks in the daylight now.  There is no stepping back  only what the mob has been primed to do. Did Cruz and Hawley do anything other than stand on the floor in suit and tie and raise legal objections  ask for answers or at least a review of the vote  Yet there is a call for their heads  among others who posed the same questions  with demands for their resignation or removal as traitors and insurrectionists. Biden Harris own all this sh t.   I agree 100 . Initially  my reaction was  quot What the fuck  Trump  quot  but then I read the transcript of the speech. You have to be insane to think Trump incited the riot after have listening to the speech or reading the transcripts.  The puppet masters outdid themselves with the rally turned riot turned reality show.  The lady that died was tragic.  The left think her death is funny and she had it coming for supporting Trump.  Someone dies at a Trump rally and we find out she was a distinguished serviceman.  I  39 m having a hard time staying up with the left logic on it all. Maybe if I lost all morals and values I would be ok with it. Loss of life is bad for either side. Nobody wins.  He said allong the lines of I hear you lot are going to march to the capitol and peaceful protest to get your voices heard.
t3_ku5pvu,Amazon joins in and now Parler is shutdown,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku5pvu/amazon_joins_in_and_now_parler_is_shutdown/,So much for the build your own if you are not allowed in the market  I  39 ve loved having Amazon  but this may be it.  I am going to seriously consider dropping Prime.  I cant be upset and still support these companies if I have a chance not to.  I have no choice with Google  Android .  This was the nail in the coffin for my Prime membership. I already despised Bezos but became hooked on the ease and speed of shopping on Amazon. Another commenter in another thread mentioned using eBay instead. As for the phone  I  39 m in the same boat. Hopefully someone comes out with an alternative but that will take a while.  I hate to say it but if there hasn  39 t been an alternative by now  I dont see one coming.  Long passed time for that  as with these other companies.  And even if there was one  no guarantee they wouldn  39 t be  quot woke quot  as well.  Seems you have to be now to be a major company.   Im watching football tonight  the few times I ever ever watch real tv.  I see the commercials.  All of these companies today have bought in or pretend to buy into the new social justice nonsense.  They dont care about the facts  they just dont want to be targeted.  I really fear the times we live in more than ever.  The power the left has is really something.   They have every major group on their side.  Colleges.  Hollywood.  News media.  Major corporations.  Big tech.  I  39 d love to be positive but I have to be realistic.  The Left is going to control and oversee our country for years to come  if not decades.  Not sure why UPS or Fedex can t become a competitor. They have the logistics.  Servers will be shutdown  by tomorrow  What now  Seriously  what now  Conservatives actually have no platform to turn to anymore.  It ll be up and running again in a week. But you re right  this is WRONG. I don t care what you believe  this kind of stuff doesn t represent the land of the free and the home of the brave.  Correct me if I  39 m wrong  but I believe I read somewhere on here that an executive on Parler said that if Amazon takes them down  they  39 ll take down the service entirely.  I just got a parley from John Matze and it said  there is a possibility that Parler will be unavailable on the internet for up to week as we rebuild from scratch. We will try our best to move to a new provider right now as we have many competing for our business... . Time will certainly tell      He also said other companies have been reaching out to provide service. AWS isn t the only one out there  though I doubt Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure will be an option. IBM  Oracle  and some other smaller companies come to mind.  Azure might.  C  39 mon Azure  that would be a swift kick in the nuts to Google and Amazon lol  That  39 s some good news for once. Appreciate it.  Yes  they re not going anywhere  They were number one in the App Store as of yesterday  before Big Tech flexed their muscles.  As sad as it is  it feels like the only place I have left is this subreddit...that  39 s scary AF.  I m almost finished with a twitter clone. They can t ban everyone.  Well  not down yet.  But Amazon will apparently not allow it to run on its servers anymore.  This is yet another coordinated attack.  You will never see them go after the left in this way.  Unbelievable.  Parler announced they are setting up new servers and hope to be up by Tuesday.  Still horrible situation.  Yeah  until the mob finds out who they are and goes after them.  Not a wise decision to cast 100 million people off of there platform. The left  and big tech will regret this decision.... We  39 ll just make our own rivals  from platforms to online shopping  Gotta give it to the left. I thought they d hit the second entirely before they went after the first.  Wow  fuck Amazon. Any businesses on Amazon servers should move  they cannot be trusted to offer a service.  You pay money  you get a service. Not we censor your service based on our beliefs. Fuck off with that shit.  Isn  39 t one party rule so dandy  I forgot what one party rule means any wanna remind what sort of government is ran by one singular party with no true opposition  Btw this sub is next  only a matter of time. Silent majority has a whole new definition now.  Agree. Just a matter of time before we are removed.  I wonder if Amazon is scared of the lefties.  Amazon is so powerful  they dont have to give in to anyone.  They did this willingly  Just like Fakebook  Apple  Gulag  Twatter and the others  they ARE the lefties.  There was no coercion necessary.  There  39 s a lot of fake virtue signalling everywhere.  Just as there were a lot of fake conservatives going along for the ride until things got too rocky for them.  Parler is still running at the moment. I just checked.  In other news  I really need to sell my iPhone now. You can still sideload the Parler app to an Android phone. Wonder if I can get that AirMessage thingy set up on an old used Mac and use iMessage on my Android  really screw them over   Parler is still up and running as of 1 9 21  11 27 p.m. mt. time.  Supposed to go down sometime Sunday.   Be back Tuesday.  For how long  no one knows.  Depends on how much pressure the mobs provides.  They  39 ll be back up and running in no time.  It  39 s a tough battle. No matter where they move  big tech will boot it off. Their only option is to go outside of US.  Amazing how he still almost got the ball there.  This kid can end up being damn good in this league.  Amazon commits suicide   News at 11
t3_kub6oy,Poll Civil War expectations reach new high 71 of Trump voters and 40 of Biden voters believe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kub6oy/poll_civil_war_expectations_reach_new_high_71_of/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  https   discord.gg conservative  a   Civil war would look ugly in today s society just because there s no definitive  side . Red states and blue states are all over the place. It would look like some Mid East faction bs. It would be weird  Red states   no food for the enemy .  Oh no no internet  What will we do  Live in a more civil society lol  Use cellular data and not pay for it   Red states  quot this seems pretty much like the last 50 years quot   There are plenty that can get internet in the right.   The Spanish Civil War  Kinda like Sarajevo  circa 1993.  I think it would be more similar to the troubles in Northern Ireland than a full blown war   removed    removed    removed   We  39 re already in one. That  39 s what the culture war is.  This. A lot of people don t seem to realize we re already in one.   We  39 ve been in one for several years and this side has now lost. When even the President of the United States is not allowed to communicate with the country for fear he might pass on something that might be outside the left  39 s narrative  stick it with a fork  it  39 s done.  I d liken it to a Cold Civil War.  Y all hold on with the war stuff until I get my reloading dies and press.. then y all can have at it.  And this impeachment and purge by big tech will only pour gas on the fire.  We  39 re already in a civil war. It  39 s not being fought with guns  it  39 s being fought with information and money. Republicans are in a horrible spot right now. The left is launching a massive cyber offensive as I type this  and we have no way to counter it.  I don  39 t want one  but it  39 s coming. When you shut down the voices of half your citizens the steam has to be released somewhere.  We have incompatible visions for the nation.   I told my wife 5 years ago that I believed we were headed for Civil War. She kinda thought I was crazy at the time.  Even though I knew about how the media spins things and tries to inject their radical leftist ideologies for years due to the whole games media thing back 2014 15 I never expected the mainstream to get this bad. I should  39 ve seen it coming but I  39 m still shocked.  I expected it to take longer.  I d felt Trump would help to postpone it  but it seems they ramped up their timeline in light of Trump exposing the depth of the corruption.   I am not nearly as prepared as I d hoped to be by this point.  Trump has been the catalyst. Maybe it s a good thing in long term. They are forced to show their ugly face prematurely  hopefully .  Agreed  As much as I try to keep convincing myself that a civil war wouldn t work in our modern day  it is still based off of the mentality of the modern civilized status quo. Its that same Left belief that we share that humans are currently better in every way  including ideology  in contrast to everything in our history  even to our most prolific figures of our past.  Either Civil War or secession. I m not sure which one would be better and which one would be worse  Secession  they could be rid of us finally and we would be rid of them. Yeah growing pains would suck but a non violent secession is the answer to our problem now. There is no logic in sharing a government with two completely clashing philosophies.  I honestly wouldn t mind things coming to that  and if that could happen in a non violent fashion  that would probably be the best outcome. Just put it to a vote  split the country and a half  let the left destroy the West Coast and come crawling back begging and pleading and sobbing for us to let them back in when they run out of money in the first five years.   removed   No  it would be between the new US and the communist US backed by China.  Ya gotta believe.  The shitty reality is that the roles are switched from the last civil war. The right has left the cultural and informational battle to the left. Slaves no longer populate plantations on the south but rather just normal American families just trying to make a living. Gun control if it is enforced to the highest degree would be of greatest concern. I literally cannot imagine the military getting involved in any form whether they follow their anti American overlords or constitutional rights of Americans. The left control the digital landscape or the modern frontier  anyone on the right is already considered subhuman aka  racist.  I really don t know how this could possibly play out  or rather is it so wild I am in disbelief denial   With an illegitimate president and a Vice President who s biggest claim to fame is trading sexual favors for political and professional gain  it seems pretty inevitable.  I know people look to the only other time that this has happened in our past and see the actual fighting that took place as the only option. But while I sincerely hope that isn  39 t the  quot Civil War quot  that is in our future  it is looking like a distinct possibility that we could have a group of people that want to come together and secede from the government of the United States. But it wouldn  39 t necessarily have to be violent.  Separation is usually violent.  It may take a generation but it will inevitably turn violent. The CCP will pressure their puppet Communist States of America to invade the bread basket Free States since there is no other  way to feed NY  CA  etc.  It makes you wonder what if  Let  39 s be honest the right got this in the bag   but by then when will Russia or China try to invade us.  Never underestimate your opponent  if a hot civil war was to break out I pray for the millions that will die as the result. This is not the way  a bloodless secession is the way.  How to divide the country   That is for someone smarter than I to come up with.  Probably give Northern Virginia  Maryland  Philadelphia and surrounding counties  Delaware  NYC  New Jersey and New England to a left leaning country. Also coastal areas of Southern California   deleted   Wait till all media is CNN left propaganda and you can  39 t even pop online and talk with others of a similar mindset because they have all been banned from any civil discourse.       
t3_kukd7p,Sarah Jeong wants to know when Twitter is going to ban Andy Ngo from the platform,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kukd7p/sarah_jeong_wants_to_know_when_twitter_is_going/,I really don  39 t understand these types of liberal Koreans. It  39 s like they completely ignore what  39 s going on in the peninsula  like how the South is still technically at war with the North and the North represents full left wing politics on steroids.  Is it her politics or is she just a spoiled brat   Politics  They re  detached from the situation on the peninsula. Roots yes but they view it through their parents.   Exactly that  39 s the problem.   People who grew up during the Great Depression were frugal to say the least. Perhaps our culture has became too soft and permissive  too individualistic and careless of the majority. That may seem like a paradox but think about it   the emotional spasm of many of these liberals  the euphoria when they  win   their violent anger   it s all about themselves and how they individually feel.  Fyi south Korea is veering left  The government  yes. The people  turned very right but are currently silenced. They  39 ve held rallies where over 10 million people showed up to support POTUS and remove Moon  Korean Constitution states that if 10 million people show up in support of the removal of a President  the President must resign but Moon has not thrice .  Well there  39 s a difference between modern left wing politics and outright Soviet level communism. No one on the left is calling for totalitarianism  if we  39 re being honest with ourselves.  What    Lmao  Uh what do you think they  39 re calling for when they  39 re calling for expelling conservative senators and presidents   When North Korea was first established  they assassinated 6 out of the 8 South Korea presidential candidates in 1948... President Rhee Syngman survived because he was talking with US officials frequently and Kim Gu was a trojan horse for them.  Are you seriously comparing south Korea to Lenin communism  The democrats in the USA are further right than pretty much any government in the west.  I  39 m comparing 21st century western leftists to soviets. They champion the same values and systems. They  39 re different in degree  not kind.  I  39 m sorry  but your point of view is not worth arguing with. Delusion isn  39 t a sign of knowledge here bud. When they say know your enemy  they don  39 t mean be completely unrealistic.  How the fuck did you get flaired  They are literally making lists to ban anyone involved with trump from jobs. If that is a delusion you are fucking blind.  They seem like one of those guys that think the Great Reset is just a conspiracy theory despite the globalists literally announcing they want to turn the world into a neo feudalistic shithole.       Anyone who thinks TGR is just a conspiracy theory is dangerously naive. It is precisely what the US intelligence community is dreaming of and what the political elite think will ensconse them in the upper echelons of some new world order.  I don  39 t know what which comment you  39 re referring to  but if it  39 s the one on the top of the thread  I  39 m saying that the North represents full left wing politics on steroids and the current Moon administration in the South has made South Korea into a leftist authoritarian state. There is now full government surveillance tracking  quot due to covid  quot  income taxes at the minimum are 35  of the poorest person  39 s salary  speaking out against the government leads to a year in prison without trial  passed the  quot gender equality law quot  which essentially gets you arrested for not using  quot pc words quot   i.e if you call your mom  quot mom quot  instead of  quot birth giver quot  and some asshole hears it and reports it to the cops  you get sentenced to 6 months in prison without a trial according to this law   and even established       which establishes a politburo above the Korean Constitution that decides whatever they want and makes up all of the laws and only democrat party members can be nominated for a position in that politburo.  Umm. I would have to disagree. One party rule  speech and thought police  Censorship defunding and deletion of all opposing thoughts  disarming the populace. And their party members cheering for it.          Disargree with the modern left   The left is actively trying to destroy the Republic.  Whether it be openly supported ideas like ending the electoral college  packing the court  adding states to change the balance of politics  weakening the first amendment with anti  hate speech  laws and public schools forbidding conservative viewpoints while allowing liberal viewpoints.... it s all happening now  Inevitable and surprised it hasn t happened long before now. He s pretty much been one of the sole indie journalists documenting Antifas mayhem. And that s problematic for those who want to gloss over the fact that they ve been violently rioting and assaulting cops all summer.  Another liberal with a Nazi mindset.  Hitler demands you silence people I do not agree with

Well  Set up the competition then Elon.  I wonder what sort of land based infrastructure is part of star link  if it  39 s capable web hosting  cloud services and the like.  I can t wait for Starlink. Musk should build a soup to nuts infrastructure over everyone s heads  just so he can show them how it s done.  Starlink is just the network  to my knowledge all data centers are ground based  so data still stored on Terra. I made a separate comment elsewhere that maybe phase 2 is to get some data centers in LEO where you could truly host your apps in the cloud     I can  39 t imagine data centers would handle heat and power requirements very well in the vacuum of space.  Data centers have  em massive  em  cooling and energy loads.  No he needs to buy Facebook and Twitter then delete them. Leave a page that says  go outside . If he did that I would do everything in my power to work for him. He s a good dude.  I know you re joking but Facebook is worth around  700 billion  Now  Myspace was once  valued at  12 billion at its peak fourteen years ago.  Difference is facebook branched out. They arent just facebook anymore.  Still  same metric applies and they can  39 t continue to keep buying the competition up when their core business is faltering.  You are wrong though. Facebook is not faltering it is thriving. They have 60 billion in cash and 33  YoY growth. Along with having NO short or long term debt.  I guess we  39 ll see  no I be stays number one in social media forever.  So eventually Facebook will be worth  60 billion plus whatever used servers go for. We can hope....  And Musk has a  200  billion right now  well on his way to deleting them.  Not really.  Tesla would have to reach a market cap of close to 4 trillion in order for Elon to be worth  700 billion.  And even then the amount of stock he has isn t liquid enough to just dump  Be even better to watch them dwindle to the new MySpace and they don t get paid anything for it.  Haha  that would be amazing.  Seriously get us out of this Elon  Like parler   I would think Elon would do something parler did not. Make sure it has its own infrastructure. Depending on Amazon Web Services was just asking for trouble. That  39 s why gab is still online.  Which is why you basically need to create your own financial institution first.  If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch  you must first invent the universe.  Probably just need to start a new country. Everyday I  39 m more okay with this. We can have the  quot flyover quot  states that they already loathe and they can have the coasts. After the split they can figure out how to feed themselves and who will do the actual work. It should be fun to watch.  You need to go back and re read the constitutional conventions and the federalist papers. There was a reason that the founding fathers didn  39 t make separate nations   war is the only outcome. It  39 s just human nature.  I honestly think this is going to be his move with starlink.  Gab is better anyway.  Dude has so much on his plate already. But I wouldnt put it past him. I  39 d support any endeavour he did anyway  One of the few based guys with real FU money.  Well the other guys know they re protected  If he speaks out against the new overlords  that FU money will not be worth much.  If you own a company that makes the most advanced space ship  39 s known to man I think any amount of money is FU money.  I  39 m a little wary trusting one sole person to be our solution to the tech problem. But if he releases his own phone I  39 ll definitely switch if not just to watch Apple and Google burn  All it takes is one.  If he makes a legitimate competitor he could pull a huge chunk of people over  simply by making the internet like it use to be.  Free and open.  MIGA.  The Tesla phone... the T phone ... insta buy for me  One of the few that gets it. I am and have been a Muskite for a while. I  39 ll continue to be one.  they weren  39 t very happy with his demands to his reopen the plant during covid  I mean  it  39 s still during COVID  and by the looks it will be for awhile.  Shit has to open sooner or later.  People need to realize this.  Too bad the left has an abundant of unemployed young folk who don  39 t have to worry about jobs to really grasp this understanding as it doesn  39 t directly affect them yet.  Ain t that the truth   What should the national voting age be instead  The way I see it is that an 18 year old will vote for whoever backs them financially.  24 should be the age  in my opinion  You gonna raise the enlistment age to 24 also   If you can fight and die for your country  you deserve ALL rights of an adult.  True. And I  39 m sure the left aren  39 t thrilled with him making this comment either. And him calling the cave rescuer  quot Pedo Guy quot  wasn  39 t very popular. But  when you  39 re the richest guy in the world and a freakin  39  genius  it  39 s okay  or at least okay to not give a care  to speak your mind  take a toke  etc.  Lol i remember that. Its all good  we all say dumb shit once in a while.  I already respected Elon but that fiasco solidified my liking him  When I found out he was a Torb main in Overwatch  I then knew he knew what was up.  What s very interesting is that Musk seems to always be many steps ahead of the crowd. Only hope is this is no exception.  I used to... rather strongly dislike him some years back  but the same can be said for Trump  and I  39 m willing to admit my mistakes. This guy  em gets it  em  and I regret letting my personal feelings be swayed by the idiot crowd.  He seems to be the only person interested in saving the human race for the long term by getting us off this planet.  Well  I was honestly hoping all the commies would volunteer to go to mars and live their utopia.  That would require work.  Commies don t want to work for a living.  That is why they are commies.  Unfortunately history shows that the exiled are the anti communists  that is why we vote republican.  I d want to get off this planet too if I lived in California.  Maybe he ll change his mind now that he s moved somewhere rooted in reality.  I mean we  39 re not leftists  you don  39 t have to agree with  em everything  em  the guy says and does. I can still think Tesla  39 s build quality is subpar among other issues  while also acknowledging Elon often makes good points politically.  He does lie and hype things a lot and the hyperloop is a fucking joke. Still  he  39 s the only rich guy out there who doesn  39 t dance the tune of fascism.  Agree....I m not fond of Musk s PT Barnum marketing tactics and don t like Tesla  but I gained some respect for the dude after reading this.  How much y all wanna bet that Elon starts his own social media platform   I honestly thought he already had one  If he could run for president  I would vote for him without hesitation.  He  39 s pro UBI. Pretty sure he  39 s called himself a socialist too. However  he doesnt seem to have that SJW strain in him so i can tolerate that.  I believe the UBI comes from his beliefs in complete automation which he initially tried with the Model 3. He did learn that a good mix of human and robots are more productive at this time. He has also spoke out against unchecked AI.  How could he possibly be a socialist   Dude idk. He  39 s the poster boy for capitalism. But he  39 s said it himself. Who knows. I like him either way tho  he  39 s a character.  If he did say that he  39 s probably doing what 99  of  quot socialists quot  do and that is call Social Democracy like in Sweden and Norway  Socialism. Which is wrong and dumb.  Could be cultural socialism he  39 s referring to which would be more like a sort of niceness or compassion towards people and harnessing each individual  39 s abilities to trade for another  39 s in the same vein as middle ages townsfolk did  all with different capabilities and wares  and each individual  39 s contribution no less or greater than the other. The blacksmith makes your knives and the farmer grows your vegetables. The doctor treats your sick and the artist paints your portrait. They are all equal.  Socialism is just a belief that social programs can do good. The problem is finding social programs that don t infringe on individual rights. Roadways  military  basic infrastructure are all great social programs that benefit everyone. Socialism lately has gained a very bad connotation for a very good reason though... not because social programs are inherently bad but because the people pushing them are proposing dangerous extremes that threaten core personal liberties.   Socialism is not just the belief that social programs are good. Social programs have NOTHING to do with socialism. Socialism is a theory of government by which the means of production  exchange  etc are owned by the community. A   39 co op  39  type of business is an example  where a community of workers all share ownership and have equal compensation. So imagine Bezos getting the same pay as a warehouse packer. The concepts are pretty stupid and not practical and is basically a bridge to communism  whereby the state owns the means of production .  What I don  39 t get is how flaires users on this sub don  39 t even know what socialism is. Social security is not socialism  it is a social program. Services the government providers have nothing to do with socialism. Grrr.  He could fund a surrogate easily enough.  He was also commenting on a bee article.  Elon Musk has the capital to start up his own social media platform and news network if he wanted to.  Does he actually have that much liquid capital  His net worth is tied up in his companies. He  39 s stated before he doesn  39 t have that much cash just laying around.  Even his compensation as CEO is paid in stock  He has 12 milestones each one awarding him about 1  of the outstanding stock.   The thing is  I don  39 t think anybody would have a problem with it if their standards were equally applied. Like  if I ran a social media company and we want to keep calls to violence off there  that  39 s totally reasonable to delete that material or suspend an account.   Russia collusion for 3 straight years.  Every single day in the headlines.    to be fair  they  39 ll just blame republicans like they do for the high cost of college  Elon has the funds to start his own social media platform with his own servers  his own payment processing system  his own email service  literally everything. Now is a perfect time to do it.  He  39 s one of the good ones.  All you moving out of California better be voting Republican. If not all you are doing is ruining another state  Not happening.  I would LOVE to see him start speaking out about all this craziness. He could have some influence.  Did anybody actually read the article  What on earth was that first paragraph....   Even countries that are not fans of Trump at all are speaking out against this. How can they not see that this is real bad   Perhaps because it may encourage their leftists to try to seize power as well   and with China Joe in charge there wont be any Americans to help them   Don t California my Florida    Watch out Elon you are going to be banned too from all media platforms.  Between Hollywood and silicon valley is there a more cancerous state in the US  One spews bile and propaganda and the other censors those that don t buy into it.  Lets not forget the education system that is brainwashing entire generations.  We all know that big tech is going to play both sides. They are only cutting off for now because they think it will give them good PR and make them look virtuous  when in reality they are only calling attention to themselves.  Tennessee welcomes all conservatives   Save us Elon  Twitter  Facebook  Google  Apple  and Amazon are basically the Walmart of information transmission and things like Parler  gab  etc are the mom and pop shops.  I wish we could go back to the 90  39 s and early 2000  39 s. IRC chats and message boards scattered everywhere.  Should  39 ve been born then like me. Get off my lawn.  Elon Musk could probably get the funding together to create servers to compete with Amazon and google... JS if he wanted to he could replatform Parler and whatnot  Dems are free to kiss. my. ass.   Honestly this might lead to a bipartisan talking point  Tech has monopolized too much and it  39 s time to break them up  Told you guys to drop your social media bullshit a few months ago.  Elon throw that weight around and buy Twitter and tell them to fuck off  Musk should start his own social media   The silly thing is that these social media companies have been the arbiters of speech for a long time. Banning Trump was just a blatant use of power. They could have just as easily turned down his  relevance score  influence whatever so that people couldn t see his posts. If you think that Twitter is just some transparent medium through which communication flows  I have a bridge to sell you.  A comfort  knowing the richest man in the world cares more about freedom than feelings.  Musk 2024     
t3_kv8utu,Elon Musk Advises People to Ditch Facebook and Use Signal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv8utu/elon_musk_advises_people_to_ditch_facebook_and/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  https   discord.gg conservative  a   Upsides of Signal are the ability to use it on your desktop laptop and text and call other Signal users. Other upsides are end to end encryption  until it is banned.   I  39 ve used signal for years  but I  39 m kinda a whore for privacy and security.  You say you are diligent about privacy and security  but this links your personal phone  Is it really that secure    Edward Snowden recommended Signal many years ago. It  39 s good. I  39 ve used it  You can already do this with apps like Google  39 s Messages app and Windows 10  39 s phone app  which also lets you wirelessly connect to your phone.   What about if you text someone not using signal   The quality can drop due to loss of signal  Signal just replaces your default SMS messenger  so it passes through as a normal text message.  On iOS I don  39 t know if you can change default messenger. Have not looked into it. They only just came around to letting you change your default browser lol.  If I am not mistaken Signal is for sending messages right  How is this a replacement for Facebook or Twitter   A ton of people use Facebook exclusively for FB Messenger. Several of my family members and kids fall under this category.  It replaces the messaging component. Signal  39 s schtick is that everything is encrypted end to end.  My guess is he  39 s talking about Messenger mainly  but I could be wrong on that.  Mostly I want to be able to make backups without having all my unencrypted conversations handed over to Google to analyse  the only backup option for WhatsApp is an unencrypted zip file uploaded to Google Drive  which  of course  Google can peruse at their leisure .  It seems like he is the only Billionaire speaking against the censorship  All the others seem to be jerking each other off in rapid succession.  Elon is our guy.  I didn  39 t used to like Elon  no real reason  not a big fan of electric cars I guess  and he has a huge fan base. BUT he is literally the only person with the juice to oppose a complete takeover of the US by globalists.   You  39 re right.  My friends think that the beltway would be nice to Sanders when they were mean to Trump  then I ask them about the rigged primary for Hillary and they shut up.  I laughed when the Dems cheated Sanders. I am not laughing now.  It s even funnier when you re realize that the Dems have been pushing removing the electoral college.  The good news is that the process just got simple. The CEOs of all the tech companies along with a few select Democrats now choose who will be the next president.  All the people have to do is be good little sheep and vote them in  Just an fyi an electric car has the fastest pikes peak time right now. So they are coming around. Just need distance for them now.  I always liked Tesla because they  39 re actually decent looking  what is the obsession with making all the other electric hybrid cars so ugly   .  He was the only one who spoke out against the lockdowns relatively early. Huge respect for this guy.  If I ever run for an elected position in our Federal Government  and I legitimately hope I get the opportunity to one day   Elon is the first person I m talking to. Not because he s a Democrat or a Republican  but because he s nether   he s an American first.  I thought he was South African first...      a href  http   memes.ucoz.com  nw 11 23334591.jpg  Every country in the world belongs to America  a   LMAO  I can imagine it now.   Technically he said FEDERAL government.   Elon honesty is a good doobie. Dude has said he s going to donate half his wealth to get to Mars.   He needs to watch total recall then.  Cohagen they need air    Get yourself to Mahs     quot I wish I had three hands. quot   This marks the start of the great digital wars of 2021 and 2024 25.   Anyone that uses Facebook messenger or SMS Text messenger on an Android phone doesn  39 t care about privacy. If you care at all about the privacy of your conversations  never use them. I have proof that Google harvests your private SMS conversations. Even if one party is on an iPhone and the other is Android  Google still gets it all. Very important that if you care at all about privacy you switch to Signal. Elon is spot on with this....  Well yeah  bezos and co make a living harvesting data on our personalities.  Well  I hung them up.  I have no personality.  Wait what  Are you saying that...even without these apps on my cell  Google is getting my SMS text messages   If you use an Android phone app to send receive SMS  yes. They absolutely do.  I just send and receive text messages. No app. like whatsapp or anything.  If you are using your Android phone to send SMS messages  thats all it takes. Google gets it all...  Fucking slime...  Please don t become  em another  em  technocrat  Musk actually  strong makes stuff  strong  and  strong does things  strong .  Musk before he started being conservative  reddit darling  can do no wrong  jesus 2.0  although  a href   r teenagers  r teenagers  a  worships him more than ever.  Because he memes  I doubt those idiots know anything about him beyond that time he smoked weed with Joe Rogan  Add Terry Crews.  He also still innovates instead of just turning into a merger  amp  acquisitions mogul like all the other Big Tech firms. The ones with monopolies on all of the internet speech.  Now they figured out how to save money.  They just collude to destroy their competitors instead of buying them.  Yes  they  39 re only getting lazier.  Exactly... the whole dream of the  quot startup quot  world now is to just be acquired by the big guys for a big amount of money. Why is it like this  Because  the juggernauts out there that is literally their whole strategy now. It  39 s little innovation. Everyone else does that now. They just buy out any potential competition  and if they like their features or tech enough they  39 ll absorb it to their own. Otherwise  they just kill it.  Reminds me of Mad Men if you ever saw it. The whole series it s basically a small advertising trying to get different contracts with big products  Like Coca Cola  Pam Am  Dodge  Hershey s  etc . Eventually they get bought out by one of the top 3 companies in NY. The protagonist then is given an assignment to advertise for Milwaukee beer. The owner of the massive company nonchalantly says  We just bought you a firm out of Milwaukee to help us with this pitch...  crazy how the big fish eat the little fish in business.  But that  39 s how it  39 s always been.  It  39 s basically impossible to innovate as a large company  especially a publicly traded large company  because there are too many stakeholders to tolerate risky moves.  Small companies are nimble  and privately owned small companies can take huge risks  because the ownership group is small and it  39 s easy to get the employees to change the company  39 s course.  Once a company grows to a certain point  it inevitably must become relatively stable in its mission.  It develops inertia both because of the sheer number of employees  but also because of the number of public shareholders.  He s already proven that he s not. Surprised twitter haven t banned him.  Soon.  he explicitly accused people focusing too much on software and not on manufacturing  Better download it before it gets taken off all app stores  s but not really  s  If you can convince enough left wing friends to join Signal  like Twitter CEO  then the app won  39 t be banned.  I literally had that thought and just did that.  I have no trust in billionaires helping us little guys having our voices heard.  Neither do I  but Musk did give California the middle finger when they tried to restrict Tesla. He  39 s no fan of censorship. He may be our best option.  Watch any interview with musk  he comes off as a real genuine guy. There s a reason he hasn t been outed in congressional hearings  ever. I m not gonna glorify everything he does  but he s without a doubt an amazing ally for freedom.  Well  he  39 s from South Africa.  Those people don  39 t fuck around anymore  not after what their country turned into.  My brother  39 s girlfriend is from SA.  Her parents are deaf and fled the country back in the 90s when she was a baby.  She  39 s  quot progressive quot  as all white urbanite women in their 30s are required to be.  I asked her  quot So why did your parents leave  quot   I knew the answer  I was just messing with her.   She got quiet and simply said  quot It was getting bad  they had to leave. quot   Except for that entire pedophile libel case. Very shameful what Elon did.  Honestly I can forgive him that. He offered to donate a sub to rescue the kids and got told to shove it up his ass by a weird expat Brit  with Thai bride half his age  who wanted all the glory.  He called the dude a pedophile.  not a pedophile  And spoke out against lockdowns.  I think when it comes to this type of stuff.   I trust Elon.   He  39 s a asshole to a lot of  quot woke quot  people you have to be nice to.   I generally think he does not care  he seems to be really black and white in a almost on the spectrum kind of way.  Did I mention he hates data collection and AI.  And he s one of the reasons the term POC or black has become more popular than African American.  Musk actually is an African American  literally.  So is anyone else in America  seeing as how Man originated in Africa.  Musk knows he s a target for being in less than lockstep with the Progunist Party.  Is Signal any good to a person without other Signal contacts   No. And that  39 s what makes Facebook and Twitter so powerful. Communications is a natural monopoly if you control the protocol.  Thanks. I  39 m all for using better  more secure tools for communication. My circle of friends are like most Americans  unaware  uninvolved  and apathetic to what is happening all around us. Sadly  Signal won  39 t do anything for me but make me unreachable. I may as well downgrade to a flip phone.  People keep talking about how we need new alternatives.   Trump may play an important role also. As we ve learned from 2020  there is no law. There is only power. Elon   Trump are our two based billionaires.  Trump said on his official account after he got permabanned that soon we  his supporters  won  39 t have to worry about being targetted and abused online for a  quot very  very long time. quot  whatever that means.  Reminder that Reddit banned the donald but still to this day allows North Korea   much of whose population lives in slave labor camps   to run a sub. You ll be very surprised to learn they mod it with an iron fist  If someone like him got red pilled all the way we could really be going places.   He doesn  39 t even have to be a conservative. He can be liberal all he wants. He just has to appreciate the constitution  freedom  privacy  etc. And then build something to protect it.   removed   To date  no one has explained to me what  39 s WRONG with doing any of those things.  What  39 s worse is the game had a mature language filter  so no one  39 s delicate sensitivities could be offended by coarse words provided they used that feature. Unfortunately  their fee fee  39 s could still be hurt and we can  39 t have that   When my cousin and I were about 13  we handed his mic to our grandmother who then proceeded to use the mic to talk to people.   It  39 s insane that the original call of duty kids throwing slurs and insults over the slightest inconvenience in a game have grown up to be the most prude and speech policing group ever seen in thisncointey  I  39 m trying to picture someone saying that to either of my grandma  39 s. Pretty sure the speaker would have received a very colorfully phrased response. Neither of them cursed often  but when they did it was epic.  Nope you  39 re toxic now  banned.  Did it years ago.........Facebook is a social media cancer  Isn  39 t Signal owned by Twitter      Waaaay ahead of you Musky  Yeah they going to ban this  unauthorized communication is strictly forbidden  It is  em Conservative  em  communication that is strictly forbidden.   removed   You know   if it hadn  39 t been for Facebook purging Conservatives I might not have taken this as seriously as I should have.  Since signal and twatter are in bed with each other it seems... telegram is your next best option.  Eventually we will all be back on icq  Musk keeps doing cool things. Perhaps the coolest tech billionaire.  Why did jack retweet  a href  https   twitter.com elonmusk status 1347165127036977153 s 20  this   a  does Twitter own them   Because someone tweeted a picture of Parler being number 1 on the app store.  That s correct. However  the signal retweet of Elon came way before the picture jack posted  Go to Signal  39 s website and Jack  39 s face is one of the first things to greet you with a glowing review. That alone makes me unable to trust this thing. Jack Dorsey is clearly in on it somehow.  By proxy  it seems like it.  a href  https   en.wikipedia.org wiki Whisper Systems  Whisper Systems  a  was acquired by Twitter in 2011.  quot Open Whisper Systems quot  owns Signal. Somewhere after Twitter buying the original Whisper Systems  Moxie Marlinspike left Twitter to found Open Whisper Systems. In 2015 this Open Whisper Systems merged with RedPhone  owned by Twitter . So Signal is most certainly attached to Twitter in some way.  I can t see the retweet but on their site he did endorse Signal so that s made me hesitant to sign up.  Aren t these totally different types of platforms   Isn t signal just encrypted SMS  essentially   The problem is the entire tech organization. User data has been monetized and that is the only way to make it in the current environment. Companies LOVE user data and will pay for it. Companies in turn support expansion of the current tech organization to get even more user data. It is a self feeding environment. Users become reliant on the organization because the companies expand their presence. When people only use Facebook or Google  to look for goods and services  a company is forced to embrace the industry model. It is a monopoly no doubt  but one that was smart to pay off the prosecutors.  Damn I said it in jest  but Elon really might be the one to help the right being silenced.  The only thing that Signal is similar to Facebook is  is Facebook Messenger. So  I don  39 t get his point.  Signal is more similar to WhatsApp  which due to the new privacy policy WhatsApp just issued is what  39 s stirring up all this recent push from WhatsApp  which is owned by Facebook  to Signal.  Signal is majority owned by Jack Dorsey  right  Telegram seems the way to go IMO.  Facebook account deleted.  Please join me in the post woke world.  Does he have stock in Signal   Jfc just build another platform already elon    The democrats are insisting that all conservatives go to their own separate institutions.

Because elections are just  over  when the polls close. No need to count everything that continues to come in.  breaking  football team comes back in the second half  other team stays on pitch for months after game is over still screaming that the other team cheated  Field....we call it a football field.  Oh dear... sounds like someone thinks the US is the whole world. In most other countries  a piece of land in which a sports game is played in is called a pitch. A rugby pitch  a football  proper football  pitch  a cricket pitch.  I bloody know proper football is played on a bloody pitch. I was fortunate to go see Man U play when I was a teen.   Considering the way the entire world obsess over every thing we do what else should we think.  Does the entire world obsess over everything you do  Or have you just believed all the propaganda that s been spoon fed to you since you were a child by the elites saying  America is the greatest country on earth  so you have no reason to second guess anything going on in the country  while also assuming since you re so obsessed with the US  so too must everyone else in the world  Or is it the fact that the US education system is so poor that children put through the system gain no understanding of the world around them  so they assume that everyone else thinks the same as they do  and is obsessed with everything their country does   Oh bugger off  Yes it is obviously just my imagination.  As every piece of social media is filled with half the world questioning everything happening in this country.  Does questioning what is going on in the country with the largest economy in the world  the largest military in the world  the country that has been at war for 222 out of the past 239 years  mean you are obsessed with it   i don  39 t understand why this is become the party line  it  39 s literally destructive to the republican party to throw around these total bullshit claims about election fraud. say it with me everyone  there was no mass fraud. it  39 s clear and obvious and there is overwhelming evidence that this was a safe election.  If you really think this election was stolen  you are delusional. It is time to move on and focus or what the Republican Party really supports and not bolster conspiracy theories as to why the party lost  This.  Republicans have an extraordinary opportunity to appeal to the working class  preserve individual liberties  maximizing personal freedoms  and stop the growth of a too powerful federal government.  With democrats as far left as they are  republicans cam become the party of common sense.  I mean  that was already the goal and this is what decades of their efforts and strategies culminated in  soooooooo............  It  39 s a bit cringe we still feel this way.  You know what would be a great way to show that people are just being delusional  a simple vote audit.  Bahahaha   My god that s Brian Kemp s music  Can you guys give it a rest  It had been known for months that Biden would get a majority of the mail in votes..  Yeah like that mail truck delivery to PA from NY. I  39 m sure those were a majority Biden  Just not 99  in the middle of the night.  Ha   This made me laugh.  Nice.  This would be more like   quot the Steelers scored the points during the game but they weren  39 t allowed to be counted until the game was over quot   Why does this feel so familiar    removed   Lmao bro chill it s a fucking meme  Hmm I bet in 2016 you were the sore loser  Bro  chill  it was just a fucking joke lol  Ik I was responding to the dipshit who deleted their comment idk why I m getting downvoted  Lies  that shit popped up in my messages and I replied directly from there even lol  Oh so you made the bad joke  Wait  so now you were upset over the joke to the point you thought you had to explain it was a meme   Why did you make up that lie about a deleted comment that wasn  39 t deleted and is still the original comment of this thread    How are you trying to insult me when you  39 re admitting you can  39 t even keep straight who you  39 re responding to on a thread with you and that one other person    This just keeps getting weirder lol  There was no voter fraud  Oh there was likely some  but not to the degree Trump or other buffoons claim.   Hilarious.    I feel you   I  39 m in the same boat and was about to make a similar comment.  Too many fake requests for admins to sift through it all in the recent few months I think so they  39 re playing it safe with flairing people. Even with this in mind some lefties have infiltrated and slipped through.  I absolutely understand   I just feel excluded from everywhere at the moment  Can  39 t seem to post any common sense response on anything in just about any other sub without getting brigaded. Got banned from  a href   r moderatepolitics  r moderatepolitics  a  for calling out some absolutely ridiculous arguments  they  39 re typically half decent but have gone full anti Trump mode lately. I  39 m not a Trump supporter  I  39 m not an American but if you make it   39 wrong  39  to be conservative or right leaning  you  39 re going to disenfranchise a LOT of people.  Oh boy youre not a fan of trump  youre in the wrong place bud.  As long as he is on the right side of the line he is exactly in the correct place.    Ive been lurking for a while but recently it just looks like a trump jerk off sub. Conservatism isnt half the nonsense that  39 s being posted here on a regular anymore.  We can  39 t control what the users post as mods.  The same thing happened when TD got shut down and we got an influx from there.  Things will even back out shortly.  Certainly hope so. Looking forward to getting a flair and struggling to bite my tongue at some of the nonsense.  Looking at the posts and the highly upvoted comments this sub is pretty far away from conservatism and I and everybody else knows it.  Then start posting about it instead of letting the MAGA crowd take it over.  I can  39 t. Not flaired.  Simply having conservative viewpoints is not enough.  You must lick boots to be a conservative.  You have to wear your stickers too  or you can  39 t talk.  Meanwhile this sub will complain about free speech without a hint of awareness of the irony.  Not a safe place. But  if a group of people are yelling during your lecture  you kick them out. Same here. Also we don t pretend to allow all ideas while not actually   em cough  em   a href   r politics  rel  nofollow  r politics  a   em cough  em   Note that although your comments may not be visible to the public in flair only threads  a mod may see and approve them  and they will be considered in a future application.  oh this is cool  thanks for letting us know  I was flaired barely a month ago. It s to prevent overt leftists from mucking up every thread. Just comment around and reply to stuff for a couple weeks and then send a nice message to the mods to request flair.  Thanks  it  39 s what I  39 m trying to do   just an extreme lack of non flair only posts  take a look for yourself and see    Oh yeah I know. My inbox was full of the  you commented on a post for flaired users only  messages for awhile lol  Ironic that a group advocating for free speech does not allow free speech  Free speech is not the intention of the sub   it  39 s a place for conservatives to discuss their varied conservative opinions on matters. I understand it  39 s a difficult concept for the left to grasp  where any slight straying from the  quot group think quot  requires you to screech NAZI at the person until they fall in line.  Not even american  so saying left right means nothing to me. My country is not as divided as yours. I  39 m just saying  i have read posts here about twitter censoring hate speech and terrorists  which apparently is not ok  but  a href   r conservative  rel  nofollow   r conservative  a  censoring difference of opinions is totally ok  I  39 m also not American but the left right political spectrum originated in Europe  so I thought you should be familiar given your far superior education system.  Yeah it  39 s nice when they do that. There soooooo much censorship on this sub it  39 s almost as bad as twitter   are you serious   I remember being told that the mods can still see comments that were removed for not having flairs so you can still comment on flair only posts to build a history to get flared even if the comment is taken down.  Good to know.  Thanks   In the same boat as you. Gave Facebook and Twitter the flick on New Years Eve. Looked at my ban history on facebook and had spent over 7 months of 2020 banned  mainly for expressing conservative views  so little loss not being on there. Moved over to Parler then the assholes collaborated to shut that down. Glad to see Parler suing amazon. I think they have a real case  especially under the RICO law in the way Apple  Google and Amazon coordinated the takedown.  I  39 ve been staying off parler too.  I guess that explains why I  39 m not getting notifications anymore.  Nobody is. Google and Apple announced they were removing them for their app stores and within an hour Amazon announced they were removing them from their servers. Apparently gaining 20 million users in a couple of months must have really scared Twitter.  It sucks but there are so many brigadiers that it is easier to auto block unflaired messages I guess.  What sucks is as a user you really have no recourse.  I got banned from Republicans not for breaking any rule but simply because the mod who was replying to my posts didn  39 t like what I said.  I reported them and had screen shots and everything but my reply said there is nothing they can do but thanks for letting them know.  Oh well.  Wear your ban as a medal. Proudly display it and expose those who deem themselves as  morally correct  for the weak minded filth they really are.  You know what  Yeah  extremists suck ass.  My error was two fold.  I didn  39 t condemn Trump  kick him to the curb  and say he was worse than hitler   satan and I also reminded them that hate speech is protected in the constitution.  I condemned the rioters and all violence a few times but it wasn  39 t enough.  I replied to the moderator saying I thought we were having a good discussion and what rule did I break   The reply I got was NO TERRORIST OR INSURRECTION SYMPATHISERS ALLOWED   I went to reply but have a 3 day band from replying to the mod.  LOL   So crazy.  No big loss there. Since Jan 6  a href   r republicans  rel  nofollow  r republicans  a  has been overrun with liberals. Won  39 t be long before they poison that sub reddit and turn it into another  a href   r politics  rel  nofollow  r politics  a . I like how this sub reddit has only flaired users policy. Keeps the liberal trolls away. I am new here and don  39 t have flair but I don  39 t mind waiting to get it. It seems to be a process that works very effectively in combatting the scourge of liberalism.  i can understand that for sure. if it makes the quality better it  39 s worth it  even if it makes it harder for people to join. that  39 s a lot better than having no real sub to discuss in or join in the first place  It cause the left will do coordinated attacks on pages like this and make fake post as fake conservatives and try to get this page banned so they have free reign to the media and only outputting their propaganda to heard more sheep and use social pressure to amass dumb followers.. peer pressure  people never learn. I lack the flair as well lol.   Have you ever seen any proof of this   You know that admins can see who posts right  At no point in the history of reddit have the admins banned a subreddit because brigaders posted rule violating content  How about a tank of copeium   Oh wow I was unaware that legal votes become illegal votes like Cinderella at midnight.   Stealers.  Why is this the worst place for censorship   We fully support free speech here. Censorship is what liberals resort to  not conservatives. You just need to go through an application   vetting process to unlock free speech in this subreddit. We just need to make sure you  39 re a conservative before allowing your posts to be visible here  that  39 s all.  You almost had me there lol.  Denial  Now that  39 s funny shit  This is funny because of how butthurt losers can be.  Sometimes in football  a touchdown is scored with 0 seconds on the clock if the last play starts before the final clock expires. Votes were cast in the allotted time  so the result  Biden wins  BY A LOT  stands and anyone who thinks this is wrong doesn t understand the rules of the game or is being lied to by people who do.   quot The NFL checked over tape and numerous angles of video and determined that no evidence of foul play was observed.... over  64 Times... in court.... in SUPREME COURT. quot   FB propaganda  in MY reddit   Just like the Falcons didn t actually lose the super bowl in 2017  They were winning 28 9 then in the 4th quarter the liberal fake news so called Patriots come in and  find  19 points to send the game to overtime  Smells fishy to me  the whole thing seems rigged  the falcons won that game 28 9  Lol  Is It just me or is asking for a private inquest   investigation into fraud and election shortcomings not unreasonable   Browns have now been banned from the NFL  NBA  and NHL  for good measure.   deleted   Even  a href  https   en.m.wikipedia.org wiki National Basketball League  Australia  rel  nofollow  australian basketball  a  is banning them  That  39 s how you know they messed up  In America  the NBL is the National Baseball League  however I screwed up  mostly because it  39 s late where I am  I should have said the MLB  Major League Baseball . My fault for making an off the cuff comment.  The points were mailed in  every point counts   That  39 s not how NFL games work  the best part of the game was watching big ben stare into space contemplate his entire existence  Funny as hell.  Steelers  aka. Stealers    that  39 s the Pennsylvania way.  I thought i was on  a href   r browns  rel  nofollow  r browns  a    gave me a heart attack  We got to have some fun around here to on occasion. Amd well lets be honest the Browns not tripping on their shoe laces coming out of the locker room is an achievement.  This is funny  Why didnt they just play better smh they could have won  Lmaooo  If only  Mad   Go Browns    During the game  we joked they were going to stop the clock and make a point dump for the Steelers. In fact  right after we said that  the streaming got interrupted and suspiciously picked up seconds later.  I ve been listening to conservative AM radio and they re scared shitless of being cut off the air  condemning the Capitol riot several times but while comparing it to statements made by democrats during BLM protests. Everything is controlled by money now and that s why Trump turned on his supporters and won t stick up for them because his brand is ruined now.  Love it.  Stealing PA lives on.      Funny  LOL  Man  They must have hired the Gov of Georgia to  find  those votes   Are they going to change their name to the  quot Dominions quot  now   I saw  quot in the middle of the night quot  and immediately thought they up and left again.  These are just low hanging fruit memes. I want something growing higher  Steelers  good one    LOL  As a yinzer  I approve this.  hm sounds familiar   I don t even like football  but as a native Clevelander  this would have made me cry.       Based     that one is good    Raiders beat Browns  Chiefs  and Saints  HOW DARE YOU INSURRECTIONISTS DEMAND THE COUNT STAY THE SAME AS THE FINAL WHISTLE      I understand the  s but the people who were added to the no fly list had it  39 s coming. Regardless of what you stand for  you aren  39 t going to bust into the capitol without getting on some lists  provided you can be identified.
t3_kvfouq,Democrat Law Professor Trump Never Actually Called for Violence or a Riot,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvfouq/democrat_law_professor_trump_never_actually/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  rel  nofollow  https   discord.gg conservative  a   Same here  today  39 s meeting started off with my one coworker stating how Trump killed the officer in dc  and should be arrested. The rest of them all pretty much agreed.  They didn  39 t seem too upset when BLM killed a black police officer.  For that incident some actually said it was wrong  but defended the logic of the protests. Basically  the protests were justified  but murder was not. On the other hand  they believed that Trump was going to box people up and start reeducation camps too  and yet  I  39 m the nutty conservative who is too uneducated.  My black friend told me  quot we have to burn shit to make a change quot . Yet he denounces Trump supporters protesting our constitutional rights.     Voting is only a right if you  39 re not a conservative.   quot yet  I  39 m the nutty conservative who is too uneducated. quot   Liberals seemed OK with pasty white Antifa people burning down minority communities all summer. Thank God it started affecting Joe Biden s poll numbers or there could have been even more damage.  The power of those who control the press.   Is this a haiku   I love how no one seems to care about the unarmed vet who got killed either.   BeCAuSE ThEy ArE TErrOrISts  Or David Dorn.  My friend thought Trump had the nuclear codes and could just pull up a box and start randomly launching missiles from his bed or something  I had to sit through a few convos about how Trump was going to start a nuclear war with china and Russia  kill off lgbtq rights and people  how he was going to force feed people religious beliefs and my favorite was the conversation on how he is trying to kill people by spreading covid.  I m still waiting for the war with N Korea that CNN promised in 2016.  Yup.  And Trump is the first president in like a billion years that didn  39 t get us involved in a huge war.  He  39 s not a puppet  and was actually a pretty damn good leader for this country.  And the idiots saying this stuff think they are our moral and intellectual betters.  People are not very intelligent  on average.  We  39 re all fucked because of it.  What  39 s sad is that there  39 s never a moment of self reflection for these people. If you went to them now and point out that this stuff didn  39 t happen  they  39 ll make an excuse and say he tried and just failed  or deflect to the next story and hyperbolic statement.  quot He LITERALLY tried to incite a coup against the US Government  quot   I  39 m still shaking from Fishgate  Ice cream gate  salt shaker gate ....  Yeah I ve heard a lot of that for the last four years. I keep asking when he s going to do al of this when he s had four years....they don t like that question.  I once told my coworker to stop referring to him as Hitler...why because Hitler was a really evil person and when you call Trump as evil as Hitler...well it makes Hitler look less evil. Their response was something about train cars  future camps and minorities being caged up already....at that point I walked away.  They distort the whole illegals being separated from their parents thing SO much.  The MSM does a GREAT job of making that whole thing look horrid.  First GOP president to openly support gay rights is totally going to kill off LGBTQ people LOL.  I spent an hour this morning getting called the paranoid one by someone from this crowd for saying that social media sites should either remain as free platforms or be charged for all the violent shit on their sites as publishers. Yeah  I m the conspiracy theorist.  Might be a good time to point out that Trump did more for gay rights in the military and otherwise  than any Democrat.  He also launched a campaign to end the criminalization of homosexuality.  In some Muslim countries they hang gay people or there them off buildings.  Someone pm d me saying that they re impeaching him because he might try and use nukes. Even if he had them he s not stupid enough to launch them  because if one countries nukes are launched  the rest of the worlds nukes are launched  and we don t want that  The times I have to tell people when they lament about trump and nuclear codes  i just laugh and tell them that  39 s not how it works and then they look at me like a dog that just heard a weird sound.  I don t understand how anyone thinks he did. I was watching his speech  or whatever you want to call it  when he basically said that after they were done at the White House  they were going to March down to the Capitol and make their voices heard. He was even going to join in. How anyone twisted it into that he said go down there and raise hell is beyond me.  Whats more crazy is they say he incited the capital building riot  but Trump finished his  a href  https   www.washingtonpost.com nation interactive 2021 capitol insurrection visual timeline   speech at the ellipse at 1 10 Pm  a  and the rioters started forming at the Capital building around 12 30 and started busting down barriers at 1 00PM before the speech was even over.   Trump supporters would have been at the speech.  Tell them you will give any of them  100 to find the quote in his speech that called for violence.  You can quote Kamala Harris who said  quot Beware   the protestors  will not let up  and they should not let up. quot   No you won  39 t win.    quot Silence   violence quot .  Best idea ever right here.  My in laws and a bunch of people I work with think he did too.  Fools are listening to every word of it and not even thinking for one second that the media hates Trump and will do anything to smear him until he is dead.  Probably even after that.  Weak minded people that do ZERO actual research on things believe this shit.  What you say doesn t matter  and never did.  What matters is what people  em felt  em  like you said.  Their logic  and anti Trump conservatives are running with it  is that he  em intentionally  em  spread false conspiracy theories about the fraud  thus he was directly responsible for the violence.  and there was no evidence of fraud ANYWHERE  too.  It never existed  and this was the most secure election in the history of the country   All you have to do is look at the video and transcript. This isn  39 t a debate about what you  em think  em  happened  it  39 s right there on video  He never called for it   These people can t be axed to look at video evidence.  Why do you think they pushed so hard to NOT audit   It  39 s funny because the only people who know more than me  a person who watched the speech  about his speech are leftists who would never watch a Trump speech  amp  absolutely wouldn  39 t just be going off of what they were told second hand by the people who control the narrative.  No  they think for themselves. They told me so.  The problem is  no one is looking at his speeches. They  39 re looking at the edited and revised CNN edition of his speeches.  A teacher at my old high school claimed that trumps 4th of July speech was the most divisive speech he had ever heard. Ass hat thinks Biden is the great unifier though.  He literally called for a  quot peaceful and patriotic quot  protest at the capital  but than again I  39 m sure he was  quot dog whistling quot  but clearly and blatently calling for peaceful protests.   quot Dog whistle quot  is a term appropriated by leftists so that they can make your words mean anything they want.  That  39 s perfect  Did someone say transcript   I ve had so many conversations with people who are blinded by their hate for trump  and can t even say why except  he s racist   that they refuse to believe anything other than what CNN feeds them.  Even if You show them FACTS like how he never actually incited anything   they refuse to believe it.  And completely ignore the hypocrisy from the left  That s because pelosi is a lying piece of   poop   He called the shit  poop     Don  39 t put it out with your boots  Ted   Don t tell me my business  devil woman   She is also insane.  And a raging alcoholic  And attempting to pull a military coup.  Exactly.  Sounds seditious... how do we report this man to the Thought Police   Let his kids do it. That  39 s their job now.  Ahhh yes....the good ol  39  hitler youth program.  I was thinking more of the Ministry of Unity now telling kids to tattle  1984  style  I was looking at what what really did happen  I understand GO did write about it  but hitler youth  Stalins youth  neighbors  etc. Would report neighbors and family to the SS or KGB for party dissent. Scary times.  All is good  but overall  both are scary enough.  Agreed. Agreed.  Yikes. Guess that s the end of his career.  I ve explained this to my friends on the left that he never explicitly said go storm the Capitol. We didn t send Bernie Sanders packing after a shooter showed up at a congressional softball game. Or when Al Sharpton led a riot in Crown Heights. But now that the fringe right did this  you better believe Republicans will have a hard time regaining any power any time soon. We ve literally shot ourselves in the foot.    quot In my view  impeaching on the speech alone would raise serious concerns over the use of impeachment in the future. Many Democrats  including members of Congress  refused to accept Trump as the legitimate president when he was elected and refused to do so as rioting broke out at the inauguration.  Many of the same members have used the same type of rhetoric to   39 take back the country  39  and   39 fight for the country.  39    Biden literally stated in a speech that he would have supported impeaching Trump again 6 months ago because he doesn  39 t like him. Straight up. He hates his guts  thus impeachment was legitimate. This is the new President of the United States that moderates helped to install because  quot Trump is too outrageous. quot   I ve watched his speech several times because people keep saying he incited the riot. I watched the edited and full versions. All he did was encourage people to march down Capitol Hill  no mention of violence if any kind. I also looked to see if he violated any Terms of Service on Twitter  and he hasn t. They blocked him incase he does.   The rioters acted of their own free will  it wasn t encouraged by Trump. I don t think Trump helped end it as soon as he could have though.  Have you never been to a large demonstration  Have you never witnessed all of the planning and crowd control that goes into a demonstration beforehand  It  39 s not a good idea  ever  to make last minute changes at a big rally like that  in DC  it  39 s typically illegal   especially after having a long speech by someone on stage talking about not being weak  and especially after you  39 ve said that the people inside the building you say you want to march to are enemies of the people.  Not a good idea   inciting a riot  Did Trump explicitly call for violence  Absolutely not.  Maxine Waters did.  Remember   He gone. Next to be canceled  So... This professor  39 s about to be unpersoned.  So I very carefully went rolling around in some of the news subs and found spots to ask them about this exact issue. The best answer was that Trump s election claims fueled the situation and incited violence by winding folks up basically. I mean  I don t disagree that his elections claims contributed but I don t think that alone caused anything. Point is that no one was willing or able to give me a substantive answer.   It would be similar to blaming the congressional base ball shooter on Bernie. Bernie spun him up on the evil Republicans blocking free healthcare and how if Republicans repealed Obamacare 9 11X10 people would die every year from it. Which is infinitely more radicalizing than what Trump has stated in regards to fraud.  Yeah   quot take back our country quot  is the type of rhetoric you hear all the time.  I think Turley is one of the most reasonable voices from the left that there is. He respects the constitution and always cautions against quick decisions that create precedents that will tear America down. He  39 s a perfect example of what political discourse in America should look like   reasonable and fairly willing to agree with the other side and always placing the needs of the country above his own political agenda   removed   This is what I  39 ve been trying to tell people.  No one listens. They  39 ve all been brainwashed by the MSM.  100   Anyone post this on  a href   r politics  r politics  a  yet   This poor man is going to get cancelled by his own party.  Yeah.. If you do the incredibly hard task of watching the fucking speech  its easy to tell  Former Democrat Law Professor...  Yup  he  39 s automatically a Nazi for speaking against the ministry of truth.  Of course he didn t. Those people were going to do what they did regardless of what he would have said. They drove too damn far from all over to not do what they already committed to doing.
t3_kvaf2k,Parler sues Amazon for suspending app from cloud service claims antitrust violation and breach of contract,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvaf2k/parler_sues_amazon_for_suspending_app_from_cloud/,This had better go to the Supreme Court   because Big Tech thinks the House  Senate  and Presidency will all look the other way when they abuse their power.  This isn t going to make it past the pretrial stages and will be booted with a 12b6 motion by the defense.   I don  39 t think this will be denied for failure to state a claim.  The claim of breach of contract should be enough.  They  39 d have a case against Google if Google plus didn  39 t fail horribly.  Everyone signs a contract to use AWS. This is a non issue as far as the courts are concerned  But it is very reasonable for any user company to expect some advance warning about being shut down so that they can do something about it.   That  39 s an incredibly good argument.  You are probably right that my example was a bit over the top. But in the end  Amazon is going to do what they think is best for them  or maybe in this case  what they feel like doing  as long as they think they can get away with it.  Not at all but I suspect the Democrats aren t going to mess with big tech. The two groups have a symbiotic relationship.  There  39 s MAYBE one democrat preventing them from packing the supreme court with however many activist justices they want. And that  39 s a big MAYBE.  If and when that is out of the way  and they kill the filabuster  the supreme court will just push through whatever legislation the democrats want. Hell they were basically already doing it before ACB was put on the bench.  Doesn t the court filibuster require super majorities  The next four years will suck  but I have faith we will resist as hard as they did  Ive lost faith that a lot of these  republicans  wont fold like a wet napkin in the next few months.  That s true  I ve been libertarian since Ron Paul  my stance has always been tear it all down. Hopefully we can vote out the RINOs and reshape the party at the very least  I think they can use the nuclear option  to change any rules on filibusters or anything else  to just a simple majority.  Simple majority can end it. Democrats used the nuclear option under Reid to end it for lower court appointments. Republicans decided they no loner trusted the Democrats on court appointments and removed it for SCOTUS. Democrats mocked outrage  though everyone knows that had Democrats had the Senate in 2016 when Scalia died the fillibuster would have been gone. They only limited their  quot nuke quot  due to no reason to expand it.  They clearly were not  as McConnel removed the filibuster for court appointments as soon as the left started blocking them.  If adding seats to the Supreme Court came to a vote today it  39 d probably end up short by  20 votes in the senate. You have to remember that most Democrats in the senate are older moderate centrists  and many of them are in somewhat vulnerable seats. Leftist populists who support moves like that make up a minority of the party  for now.  Hopefully if they try the Supreme Court will figure something out and stop it. remember FDR failed it expand it. If not they better stop the exploitation of the electoral collage cause by the dems  SCOTUS could slow walk it past the next election or rule packing is unconstitutional  the way the Dems just did it  on some technicality.  That  39 s like having two Popes. Doesn  39 t work out well.   The Democrats have a deal with big tech   They don  39 t  em think  em  the legislative and executive branches will look the other way. They know it  because it  39 s dead on the money.  And so far  they re right  No standing for antitrust   AWS only has a 32  market share  with Azure and GCP not too far behind. It  39 s not like they  39 re serving 4K video all the time either   any moderately sized cloud platform could support them. As for breach of contract  I don  39 t know the details but I could see them just paying them off.   quot I  39 m not truly a monopoly quot  is not a defense to an anti trust charge.   How is it  quot transparently collusive quot   Just because every upscale bar in New York refuses to serve me because I  39 m wearing flip flops does not mean they colluded to do so.  The timing. Parler has existed in the spotlight for months  and is only being singled out as  quot dangerously in violation of policy quot  now that the President is a  quot social media free agent quot . Coincidence   I don  39 t think you  39 ve been on the app stores for any of these services.  quot Standards quot  isn  39 t really a word I would apply to them.  They were already caught out in Senate hearings as coordinating such practices amongst one another.   As for breach of contract  their contract with Amazon likely has some promoting illegal activities clause in it. They will argue that Trump supporters used Parler to plan the Capitol riot. If Amazon gets it to the right court for them  that could work.   Oh yeah. Now we are talking.   Get the worst slime bucket dirtbag lawyers on the planet on this cause Amazon is a big fat rich target  Lin Wood  Isn  39 t he busy fight fifth dimensional alien vampires or something   That sounds like an amazing 90 s Marvel cartoon.  Nah sounds more like an Alex Jones episode. INTERDIMENSIONAL TIME TRAVELING PSYCHIC PEDOPHILE VAMPIRES   What is this  a crossover episode   Sprinkle some porn in just to make it a bit more interesting.  That nutjob  No one would take it seriously.  It was a joke  No.  Keep him   Powell  and Giuliani away from this stuff.  I d sure rather see someone with recent success . . .  For a great laugh  scroll down to the comment section... so many angry leftists.  Man  you weren t kidding   Reading their angry comments have become my newest form of entertainment  Do they have a chance to win  If they broke the 30 day warning period then they are probably going to get some sort of compensation from Amazon. Ifk if an antitrust lawsuit will work but I think it would be extremely easy on their part to find massive amounts of posts on other sites that break the terms of service to show they are being singled out  What you  39 re forgetting however is that Parler is protected under section 230....  It s not a gotcha that they are protected under 230  they are performing in accordance with it by not curating content   it s the other big guys who aren t  and who thusly shouldn t be afforded the protections .  Wouldn t a lawsuit against google and Apple be more sure fire because the stated reason for removing Parler was because they had posts that incited violence  yet Twitter has the same issue and is still allowed   Amazon is a sorta competitor to Google in this space. Amazon has their web hosting  but so does google. Sorta.   Lmfao that would be hilarious if they argued that  That  39 s... actually a really good point  On the contract it depends on the terms of the contract. I  39 m willing to bet that Amazon has their service agreements so one sided they can probably do anything they want. The more important issue will be the anti trust  in which these big companies conspired to kill off a competing platform. Unless they have some very specific examples of violations of their terms of service other than  quot we just don  39 t like you quot . The anti trust thing seems pretty obvious but the devil is in the details.  One type of challenge that can be made is  quot did the other party fulfill the interpretation of this clause  quot   but another is  quot is this clause a valid one under current law  quot .  Yeah  you cut to the core of it. A lot of people think that agreeing to something binds you to it  but that isn t how the law works. Both parties could have super double pinky promised to uphold the terms of the contract to the letter and when the deal goes sideways  they can still unleash the lawyers and potentially get out of it.  I work with AWS and Azure  the contract for accounts that qualify for a TAM are pretty standard for the old managed hosting industry.  For larger companies like Fortune 500 that would have AWS managed guys directly involved it would be even more in their favor as they would likely have dedicated hosts if not racks.     Is Twitville a platform or a publisher    deleted   Waht  Take them to the cleaners.  More likely Amazon will drain Parler through long and costly legal proceedings.  Parler vs Amazon will be one for the textbooks  This may have to go all the way to the SCOTUS and I don t like our chances.  That s why President Trump was pushing to modify section 230  The Democrats largely promised to stuff the Supreme Court the instant they could. And now they can.  Manchin said he won t pack the courts. Here s hoping he comes through.  And he is one man  which is very easy to buy off. Expect his nephew to land a ten million dollar contract and he will suddenly have a best seller book that will fly off the shelves selling 3 million copies.  Very concerned you are correct  He should have done what Obama did.  Set up a lawsuit against the government then order the government lawyers to throw the case resulting in a  quot settlement quot  where millions of taxpayer dollars went to political groups.  The same tactic that state governors used to change election law. Call up his buddies  have them sue the state to change election law  immediately settle.  I don  39 t think it  39 s going to end up going well for Amazon. Even if they fend off Parler  they are walking a very tight rope with anti trust with AWS  and I don  39 t think they will come out particularly well from an increased scrutiny of one company hosting 50  of American internet sites.  Unfortunately  Amazon now is so massive they just don t care. It would take a act of congress to do something and we all know thats not going to happen now  at least anytime soon. Even if ordered to pay Parler  1B do you think they care  Business as usual for them.  Why can  39 t it happen  There are many progressive Democrats who absolutely want to break up big tech.  Do they still want to   I really hope so.  I haven  39 t used amazon since 2017 and did pull the dramatic  quot I  39 m not supporting a monopoly quot  drama and you know what   It  39 s not heroic because it  39 s so easy   So many stores have great ecommerce sites nowadays.    I hope they can get a fuck load of money from this.  Although money does not win cases  it helps. I m not sure how things will go fighting an opponent that prints money.  Good  Amazon should be sued  and should pay heavily.  America is now ruled by four billionaires....and half the country is ok with that. Scary stuff.  Good for them.  They should have sought an injunction before they were taken down.  Time to TRUST BUST these monopolies  So can a platform be held accountable for the content therein  or not  Seems big tech wants to have their cake and eat it too.  Sue the balls off them.  Looks like Parler has some solid legal ground. This will be interesting to watch   Called it   Godspeed.

Trump forgot because he never opens his bible either.   We all know Trumps no Christian.  I  39 ve been saying this to all of my evangelical friends  I  39 m Christian too   but they practically worship Trump. He  39 s seriously just a step below Mary to them.  He s quite a step above Mary to most evangelicals I ve talked to  but s that s mostly just about them being against Mary  Christians aren  39 t against Mary  they  39 re just against how Catholics practically deify her.  a matter of degree if you are talking about   39 images and icons  39   Shit  I would ve hid them in the election fraud evidence vault. That things gonna be sealed for a long time and no ones going in there.  The Bible would burn her fingers the second she d touch it  I probably laughed at this harder than I should of  No more oaths of office.

The Dems all have the New International Version that has the right to abortion where the 2nd amendment is supposed to be.  Does Pence have access to the nuclear codes   Because this would have made a lot more sense with his name instead of Trump s.  Her eyes then went to the big Bible on Trump  39 s desk.  quot No... you wouldn  39 t  MY GREATEST WEAKNESS    NOOOOO  quot  She tried to open the Bible but was severely burned and quickly disapparated.  quot I  39 ll get you one day  Trump    quot    a href  https   imgur.com gallery 2JgzMfG  https   imgur.com gallery 2JgzMfG  a   Burst into fire if she touched it.

t3_kvh1is,Parler finds refuge with rightleaning webhosting service,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvh1is/parler_finds_refuge_with_rightleaning_webhosting/,And the free market solves another problem. When there s money to be made  someone will step up.  Just wait until mastercard  visa  and the banks blacklist epik.  This is the shit that will get out of hand. What  39 s next  Chase and BoA kick out Republicans  Where does it end.  Democrat coin  is that like Monopoly money   Worse. Fake plastic coins from the dollar tree.  I would be down with chocolate money  Who robs a dollar tree   Classy people.  It  39 s regular money  just stolen  No Venezuelan Bolivar  Banks love money  they want to start that shit  they will be relying on dorks who sit on the internet all day till mommy calls them for dinner  So basically half this sub.  it  39 s a pandemic  george     They already do it for guns.  Well my wife and I will take our 300k year out of BoA  close out our 300k home loan with them  and get both our employers  conservative businesses that gross a combined 30 million a year  to do the same.  We  39 re both high enough up and influential enough to make a dent  Make sure you let them know why  That s great but 30.3 mil is nothing to BoA. And you re a huge outlier.  It is to the branch that houses those accounts.  That  39 s only one small grouping of people.  We  39 re not alone.  Not true. A  30 million withdrawal will make it to the CEO  39 s desk.  A  30 mil withdraw for one of the largest banks in the worlds happens every single day if not hour. It s not noteworthy.  A withdrawal is entirely different from an account being shut down and transferred to another institution. I worked as a personal banker for years. 30 million walking out the door will absolutely grab attention from CEOs  They may have billions daily in traffic  but a single  30 mil withdrawal will definitely raise an eyebrow  and result in a phone call.  The fact that you believe that shows just how little you know about the banking world.  Are you sure   B OF A is also anti gun.  I  39 m currently making preparations for serious life and finance shifts as well. Nomad capitalists will leave in droves if sufficiently provoked.   39 Tread lightly  39  is not some isolated proverb  the left will find out how many are preaching what they practice.  In my experience  a Democrat and their money are soon parted.  This has been happening for a while now. David Horowitz was blacklisted by Visa and Mastercard for being critical of Islam.  If that happens  take your money out of those banks.  Time to roll into crypto.  I remember bitcoin at  238 when I first read about it in the print version of mental floss..  now 40k   it  39 s not them I  39 m worried about it  39 s the IRS.  Lest we not forget what happened the last time these fucks were in office.  Or the rest of the internet blacklists Epik and cuts them off the network  Then that leaves room for a Republican to start their own service and take 45  percent of those markets. Maybe I need to get into the financial world...  Other banks and credit cards will pop up that want our money more than they want to virtue signal to the far left.  They  39 re showing us who to boycott  at least.  Cloudflare is another one that  39 s pulled shenanigans before.  It s all good. We have crypto now  They ll ha e to switch to bitcoin lol  Who says capitalism doesn t work   The web host is called Epik  incase anyone wants to take their services there.  They are going to need all the funding they can get.  They re about to get rich  as long as they keep their nose clean.  You know what  they can do all the cocaine they want if they support free speech.  Imagine if Republicans became the party of freedom and democrats became the party of control.  Yea. Imagine.  It  39 s easy if you try  I fucking hate that song.   quot nothing to live or die for.... quot   Me too. It  39 s basically the Globalist National Anthem and I can  39 t stand it  Will look inti it and if legit will switch.  I looked at the pricing of their dedicated servers and they were super expensive. If I would be building a new service  I would straight out think foreign providers...  This isn  39 t done yet. There are still ISP  39 s to refuse service and banks.  ISPs  DNS services  email  payment services  investors... of course there s still more  but eventually the far left will start harassing another company they feel is an easier more vulnerable target.  They do tend to lose interest in individual targets  with one notable exception  rather quickly. Then again  I can t help but feel we re entering a new age so to speak.  Hell yes  This is what I  39 m talking about.  Good  they should be allowed to provide their services. That being said I will keep using Gab.  Is Gab any good  How many people are on it   Well it doesn t work right now because so many people are trying to join haha. But overall I like it and hopefully they get the servers settled down.  Yeah it takes forever just to open the page and I can never get anything more to load once I scroll down.  I  39 m talking about just an .apk file direct from their website.  They do have an app  just scroll down and select gab apps.  Its right at the bottom of the webpage along with privacy policy etc    Despite that the left has Corporations  Universities  Hollywood  Mainstream Media  Globalists  China  Sporting leagues  and Big Tech to carry their water they can barely compete with us   then why are they winning  Right. Whoever has everything in that first paragraph is winning  regardless of their beliefs.  Oh  and how to raise your children on puberty blockers.  A 15 year old kid who I tutored came out to me as trans... I feel so bad for him.  Right Leaning....   Conservatives have been mocked  harassed and shot at for twelve years so pardon me if I don t have sympathy for the left.  Still could be a high bar for Parler to get back up and running.  Depending how they were deployed on AWS  the differences in stack  or at least how it was orchestrated and deployed could differ and require significant work to change.  As expected.  Question is who is going to trust them with anything after what just happened with the hack.  I will continue to use it  however my account was not verified. I will never use any service that requires that kind of information because of ... well exactly what happened.  What hack  Hack of Parler or the new server host    a href  https   www.reddit.com r Conservative comments kv34ok 70tb of parler users data leaked by security   https   www.reddit.com r Conservative comments kv34ok 70tb of parler users data leaked by security   a   Wow  and she called herself crash override  that  39 s pretty funny... not for Parler users though. So there are woke hackers now  the world just got worse.  There have been woke hackers as long as there have been hackers.  You  39 re probably right. This information she has taken though is raw and contains personal info like location  I think she should be arrested if she shares any of this publicly as it could endanger people. Hopefully the EU data protection people will go after her.  She  39 s not a hacker  she  39 s  a security researcher           I hate the segregated society the left is creating yet I see no other way to fight back than supporting other companies  Uh oh  a href   r technology  r technology  a  isn  39 t going to be happy  It s so weird to me that parlor got targeted so much. Sure there were some lowlifes on there but mostly it was fine  It was an attempt to continue to stifle the President.  I cant believe even our web hosting services need to be political. Wtf has happened to our country   liberals happened.  You mean a webhost committed to freedom.  They will bring the fight to your door.  Ayeeeeee  fantastic news   Is Parler back up  It didn t work a few minutes ago.  will be several days  maybe a week before they are functional again.  That  39 s how markets work as long as consumers have a plethora of choices.  I believe that as long as individual and businesses customers have a plethora of choices when trying to buy a service or product  I don  39 t see the reason for the government to step in.  For anyone who didn  39 t hear the ceo on Beck  39 s show... the funny part is they aren  39 t even against taking down content  they just want to do it the old way of a person deciding instead of the stupid algorithms that twitter uses.  See told you guys it would be fine. Don  39 t be crybabies like leftists  If you think we are fine and in the clear  you are going to be surprised. Credit card companies and banks could drop them along with payment processors. We have a major problem and to blow it off is silly and dangerous.  This will end with them and any company that works with them getting blacklisted by the credit card processors.  I think Hostgator just lost me as a customer.  Do they use AWS or something   Did AWS let them get their data.  I assume they had back ups.  Should be that hard to build out their own servers in a Colo somewhere.  Its also nice having a DR strategy that doesn  39 t rely on a single service provider.  Make DR and off site backs to 3rd location   Unfortunately it doesn  39 t look like they offer any VPS service similar to EC2. Only dedicated servers and shared hosting.  When they get getting called right leaning the go to response should be actually we are   39 non political  39   Companies beware. The precedent has been set. AWS can and will terminate your hosting if they decide they don t like you.    In its lawsuit  Parler claimed that  without Amazon  39 s support   quot Parler is finished as it has no way to get online. quot  Parler also said that switching to a different service provider  like Epik  in order to host its platform would require significant changes to its website  which would cause the website to go offline for a  quot financially devastating period. quot

Freedom of opinion is an essential right of elementary significance.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv9fud/germanys_angela_merkel_twitter_ban_of_trump/,Twitter  Hi Angela Merkel  we have found that you are spreading misinformation and have decided to suspend your account.  Germany knows better than anyone  They don  39 t have much nostalgia for this one.  Mexico and now Germany...  And Australia and France.  Can you link what Australia and France have said   Not sure about France  but I  39 m pretty sure Australia said  quot Oi  c nt... What do you think you  39 re doing quot .  England reportedly said  U fookin wot m8  in response to Trumps Twitter ban.  Now do the Scottish   I bet we won  39 t understand a damn word.   a href  https   www.google.com amp s fortune.com 2021 01 11 problematic twitter merkel france trump amp   https   www.google.com amp s fortune.com 2021 01 11 problematic twitter merkel france trump amp   a   When even Germany is saying ya done fucked up  ya really done fucked up.  Especially if it  39 s Merkel saying it  Exactly.  Shit  Germany has restrictions on certain types of speech  agreed    strong Germany  strong   em saying there s a problem going on with free speech in the US  em    Actually Germany said that the government needed to step in and create laws curtailing speech instead of social media having to step in... it was there way of saying repeal the 1st amendment... I mean with merkels history it doesn t surprise me.  Yeah I was disappointed when I read more it s pretty misleading actually.  According to this article that s not quite what they said. They said the decision to ban someone should come from legal channels not the decision of a corporation. If it were to ban someone it should be the government. They weren t necessarily saying they  em had  em  to.  what world do we live anymore lol  CNN   em breaking news  German chancellor admits she  39 s a racist and a bigot  em    Nazi  omg  she said something I agree with  When the Globalists call leftists out for overreaching you know it  39 s really egregious. ACLU too.  Clown libs are ruining the long game.  They  39 re making it too obvious and giving us a fighting chance by going too far too fast.  Yo if Germany is calling you out for attacks on freedom you really fucked up..  Where are these stupid little libs who spent half the day yesterday trying to convince me that twitter banning Trump has nothing to do with free speech  Big tech is  em clearly  em  in bed with leftist politicians  and now they  39 re doing their bidding.    Like if a cop TELLS someone to do something like go into a house and conduct a search that would be illegal for him  the search is still illegal.    Leftists acting more and more like Nazi Germany everyday  getting called out by the country itself...  Even the   39 democratic socialists  39  are worried about this one. We skipped the high taxes and middle class bankruptcy phases of the transition to socialism  and just skipped to absolute loyalty and support of The Party through fear and control.          The high taxes are coming  won t be long.  When German Hillary Clinton says you went to far.... you done went too far  She  39 s not German Hillary... She can actually get elected.  Jack Dorsey is a piece of shit  hellbent on destroying humanity.   I hope he gets his real soon.  Remove 230 protection  Class them as common carriers  like phone companies.  That really is what needs to be done. No one forces you to get a phone  no one forces you to get a social media platform. The phone company can  39 t prevent you from saying what you want over their lines  social media companies shouldn  39 t be able to prevent you from saying what you want on their platform.  This should have been the case for server companies  social media  communication apps  email services  etc. There s no way the Democrats will even consider repealing 230 or anything of the sort as long as they re in power and I have real doubts the Republicans would either though this situation ought to make them think they need to get serious.  Yeah  Germany has been down this road before. It  39 s called Nazi Germany...Hitler... quot cleansing quot ...any of that ring a bell liberals   If you  39 re ANTI FASCIST you can  39 t be a FASCIST. words be like that. It  39 s like North Korea people  39 s Democratic party. Usually socialist and Democrat mean somebody is getting thrown in a camp because of their ethnicity possible political alliances or wealth status  Violence is bad  unless we re doing it  You know you ve got problems when Merkel is the one with the Based takes...  Is it a based take or does she see their long con about to explode because American libs went full Leroy Jenkins   And yet again  another hilarious example of someone reddit immediately turned on  You know you are crossing the line if Angela Merkel calls you out for freedom of speech violations.  This is just great. We ve got the freakin Germans lecturing us about liberty  Sheesh  Lol even the birth country of Nazism says leftist are batshit.  Germany is lecturing the US on free speech now. That s how far we ve fallen in such a short time.  Okay if SHE S saying that we re really in trouble  Wow for once as an EU citizen I m glad this old witch is not saying something stupid or against us peasants  I m mortified that Germany is giving us free speech lessons.  And yet Merkel was recorded asking what Zuckerberg was going to do about Germans who were opposed to mass immigration into Germany.  Maybe when the Germans are saying that you  39 re starting to look a bit Fascist you should listen. Unfortunately I doubt the left will listen.p  All the lefties who have been calling Merkel the Leader of the Free World have left the chat   em Merkel  em  of all people  sheesh everyone is doing a 180  I haven  39 t seen anyone mention that Trump directly attacked the same tech companies that banded him for the next crazy thing. To me this seems like the motivation to remove him more than what he said. All sorts of people tweet  from the Arab spring tweets that changed several countries to hateful teenagers venting to the world. But they are not banned because they don  39 t threaten the profits of twitter.  How long until Twitter bans Angela Merkel     Can  39 t you get imprisoned in Germany for  quot hate speach quot    Damn... so she WAS a NAZI all this time.  Maybe Trump could hold a press conference if he want to say something  Liberals in 2018   quot Yass Queen Merkel  Slay that Orange shit  quot   em snaps both fingers in applause  em .   Am I in the twilight zone   Chances are this has less to do with freedom of Speech and more to do with the amount of power American tech companies have.  Very true. The EU ultimately would like some global internet law. Their problem with recent events isn t with the idea of suppressing speech itself  but the idea that a corporation   rather than a government   is the one calling the shots.  Maybe I  39 m naive but I think the majority agree with us. It doesn  39 t help in that he  39 s still banned but it does feel a little better every time you hear or see someone agreeing.  What a bloodless statement.  She was born in East Germany.... nuff said.
t3_kvap5t,Twitter Shares Down More Than 12 Percent After Company Blocked Trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvap5t/twitter_shares_down_more_than_12_percent_after/,If Twitter and FB and all social media just disappeared the world would be a better place.   Some people spend their whole day on what should be restricted to time on the toilet.  I signed up for Reddit years ago to get help and help others in a niche subreddit.  That is what Reddit should be for  not what it turned into.  Same here.  Signed up 4 years ago to get help on a Dell computer  and somehow ended up in  a href   r politics   r politics  a .  Got downvoted to hell and magically whisked to this sub.   I don  39 t think my computer question was ever answered    Reddit is the most toxic and hateful site I thin I ve ever been apart of  I got a bunch of death threats a couple days ago for posting in this sub. I had to turn off my messaging  lol  Well  they obviously hate small business owners  so...  Someone asked me  quot What  39 s your business name and where are you located  quot  lol  They wanted to send some of their comrades over to your place.  Obviously  that  39 s why they don  39 t condemn blm when they riot and burn down hundreds of small businesses  I want this website to dissappear forever and I  39 d be 100  OK with that.  The private messages many of us receive for posting here have...not been positive.  I love how you can be posting in another sub about the most random subject  r underwaterbasketweavingtips and randomly get a message  le orange man is bad    On the up side  the non flaired people that post in flaired only posts seem to have no idea we cant see their posts.  Yeah  Reddit can be trash  but only on certain topics. If you have certain interest you find some good and helpful ones.  The political subs are cancer  as are the news subs. Reddit is great at informing me about what PC components I should buy  or how I should invest money. Every time I read my DMs I steel myself for some vicious hate messages lol    I posted in  a href   r blacksmithing  r blacksmithing  a  about the origins of a 19th swedish anvil and instantly got back   quot oh  you post in  a href   r thedonald  r thedonald  a  you moron  hur dur orange man bad quot  from a random lurker.  Never had I ever thought about searching for the background of random participants in a discussion just to insult them off topic.  Who has time for that   I ve been off Twitter for years and just recently dumped Facebook back in early December along with Snapchat. I still use Reddit but I m damn close to getting off this platform as well  Is it possible to remove yourself completely from Facebook or Twitter  though   I  39 m not even sure you can do that  unfortunately.  This is 100  truth  Good  go right to zero.  Go low enough so Elon Musk buys you and publically fires Jack Dorsey.  Knowing Elon Musk  this isn  39 t out of the realm of possibility.  Papa Musk will save us all  Apple   than threatens to remove the app from the store after he removes moderation control.  His worth is 185B. Twitter is worth 38.32B right now. I don t know how much Musk has on hand mind you.   It had to be done   I would pay money to see this happen.  So should Elon.  Hope these employees lose all their wealth if they had stocks. And lose their jobs  Twitter is one company I could care less if they went out of business. Jack Dorsey is a PoS....  He has a shit ton of money  yet he can t afford a stylist. Every time I see him he looks like a hobo.  Yup I think he needs to be taken down a peg or 2.  I m sure they ll stand by their convictions once their options are worth  0  same  And below.  100  I really dont understand why twitter has any market value.  If anything proves that we are in a stock bubble  it is people willing to pay for a fully mature tech company with no room for growth that still has little revenue and no path to profitability.    This was probably inevitable even if they didn  39 t delete Trump  39 s account.  Social Media thrives on rage  and with Democrats soon to be in control of all three branches of government  the Democrat Media Complex now has to pretend everything is hunky dory.  Hard to monetize rage tweeting when you have to pretend Biden is the second coming of Washington.  What  39 s after Trump and the rest of us conservatives  Who will they go after  Will they finally be able to live in harmony in a racist  fascist  bigoted  nazi free zone .......  Thank you for your reply   Yes. I think the traditionally liberal core of the Democrat establishment has lost control of the wild leftists on their wings  and they  39 re going to be in for the fight of their lives going forward.  The establishment democrats are the Mensheviks. And the AOC types are the Bolsheviks.  They will attempt to target conservatives who are threats in the future. They did this with Sarah Palin after the 2008 election where they had super majorities and the presidency. The media dedicated large amounts of time slandering and attacking her as they feared she would run for president. Expect targeting of Cruz  Haley  Pence  and in other potential 2024 nominees.  I think this will determine if the democrats will treat all Republicans the same as Trump or if Trump was the anomaly with the amount of abuse he was getting. We need to see if they will start slandering the republican minority in both House and Senate.  Well the only move in their playbook is  quot  Current Republican Nominee  is so much worse than  Previous Republican Nominee President . quot   So assume the next candidate will also be deplatformed.  Have you not heard of  quot Bush Derangement Syndrome quot   It was used long before Trump started running in politics. Bush was  quot literally Hitler quot  and they burned effigies of him in numerous rallies and protests. He was a  quot stupid monkey quot   and  quot brain damaged quot  due to his speech patterns.  quot Bush Lied People Died quot    quot Bush went to war for oil  The Warmonger  quot   I  39 ve sort of heard about it. During that time I was in my own world in high school. I can only imagine that it  39 s worse now all because of the left leaning MSM and social media.  It wasn  39 t as magnified then because social media was still relatively new  but there were plenty of instances where W was referred to as Hitler as well.  Seems to be the go to for any Republican President.  Yup  it  39 s an irony that both mainstream media like CNN and MSNBC and social media both greatly benefited from Trump  while most conservative media probably would have done better if Hillary was elected.  I  39 m sure I  39 m not the only one who noticed that social media monetized Trump until the last possible second  then axed him.   quot Principled quot  indeed.  SJW  39 s will always find something to complain about. They  39 ll always be something they want to have canceled.  Let s see how far we can get this stock to tank  Gettest woketh  goest broketh  Who cares    Without Trump  who cares what people tweet    You ate lunch   What a surprise.  Twitter exists so you can demand people to accept the gender of your lunch.  underrated comment.  Keep pushing. Delete Twitter and make a Gab account.  Jack Dorsey looks like a tall dwarf  Woke Rasputin  Let  39 s dub him  quot Ori quot .  That  39 s an insult to hard working Dwarves everywhere.   Not enough. This fucking scumbag bugman billionaire literally gloated on his own platform about how other scumbag bugmen billionaires colluded to take down his fucking competition.  Not enough.  Gotta drop at least 50  before these communistas start to panic.  Yeah  12  is enough to get investors to buy the dip. Hard to know if this is a correction until they report their numbers.  Gee. Maybe it has something to do with their closed mindedness and no acceptance   I think the market realized that Twitter just killed their goose that lays golden eggs.  Yep.  Or the fact that their income is based off advertising and number of users....and Twitter  just killed their own income by getting rid of users.  Bad practice from a business aspect.  Agreed. Also does not help that I think some people are finally realizing that it is made up of morons.  They committed suicide. They knew what would happen if he was banned   everyone did. Twitter is a sacrificial pawn meant to normalize the suppression of opposition voices. Everyone followed suit after them.  Oh yeah. Major corporate suicide. Makes me glad I never got a Twitter account since it is shit.  No shit Dorsey  Who would have thought that would happen   You pretentious phuck  Dorsey doesn  39 t care  Twitter is worth billions. The only thing that would make him care is a rival to his monopoly like parler.  I just deactivated my account though I never really used it  This will not affect Twitter in the long run at all. You guys just witnessed the biggest most blatant anti trust violation that s ever happened. Twitter  Google  Amazon  Apple all came together and squashed Parler.  To be fair the federal government hasn  39 t done anything about corporate collusion in decades. Cell Phone carriers were abusing the shit out of collusion throughout the 00  39 s with no repercussions.  quot Hey I  39 m going to charge an outrageous .50 per text  quot   quot You know what  That sounds like a good idea  I will also charge .50 per text  even though it costs absolutely nothing quot .  quot Yeah  I know it would make it smart for me to undercut you guys and charge only .30 per text to scoop up your market share of cell phones  but I  39 m also going to charge .50 per text. It  39 s such a good number quot . They couldn  39 t have been any more blatant about it  and nothing happened to them.  Cable companies are doing it now with data  This company stock will probably sink so low they will sell out to another tech giant. This is no longer a viable company.   MySpace 2.0. If any tech company is going down  it s this one.  We have to demonstrate our will  amp  unity.   This must end.  these tech companies only go down when they get replaced. Unless there is a replacement  you won  39 t see  that happen.  Twitter is the only one that can be foresee ably replaced. All the others  not so much.  Imagine if people left Facebook en masse and went  em back  em  to MySpace  Full circle hahaha.  why the hell would you buy a twitter stock  It  39 s literally a digital playground for rich snobs to post their idiotic comments. People can do that on any real platform they want.  it was down 6 . this is considered a normal dip. I  39 ll make a friendly bet that people will see this and mistake it for a dip  bringing the stock price back to where it was in a week with no new news against it.  Good. I don t want to see a small slide  I want to see a massive one.  Get woke  go broke.  People keep posting these percentages like they mean anything. Even with these declines  it doesn t approach the lows of 2015 and 2016. This doesn t faze anything. You want to kill the platform  You need to deactivate you account and get someone else to do the same thing and then keep on going.  I would think it would be more  I mean he had over 88 million followers. I think a lot of people were on Twitter because of Trump   I know I was.  I sold my shares.  It was a decent performer for me but I can find better uses for that money.  It  39 s only a start. Twitter can fall 12  daily until it  39 s sold as a penny stock as far as I care.  Lot of nervous investors who see some big lawsuits coming.  LOL. I ll buy some Twitter stock once it s a penny stock after they re under new management.  Wonderful.  Good  They deserve to bottom out.   quot There are levels of survival we arw willing to accept. quot   Twitter needs to go the way of Tumblr.  I loved the Timcast where he massacred soybeard Dorsey like a total savage  for his offenses against free speech. Dorsey tried to have his fembot slave girl answer every question for him but they ended up looking like Douchebags LLC.  Let s bring it lower  Unhook yourselves from this trash  you ll live a better life for it.  Parents take it off your kinds  addiction boxes  Not enough  For the love of god make them go bankrupt. I would love nothing more than to see all of their employees with nowhere to go.  I dropped 25 followers before I deleted my account. The purge is great  STONKS     Epic gamer moment  Needs to outright crash.  Fuck this cancel culture bullshit.  Liberals are literally the modern equivalent of fascism and the Nazi Party.  They are everything our founding fathers warned us about.  Please keep falling     I am happy that I deleted my Twitter and Facebook today. Downloaded all my photo albums  told my friends they can reach my phone or on GAB then deleted. Feels good honestly.  Out of the big 5 they have the lowest revenue by a massive margin at 3 billion.  Just deleted my Twitter account that I haven t used in a year. I ll add to anything that makes that trash company suffer.  Fuck   39 em.  Leave Twitter now.  en masse.  It  39 s a cesspool of filth  and the company is worse.  Not enough  All the liberals gonna to buy it  they will want to prop it up     So when it tanks  when Sane America really goes after it  they will lose their investment in tyranny.
t3_kv34ok,70TB of Parler users data leaked by security researchers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv34ok/70tb_of_parler_users_data_leaked_by_security/,Does Twitter have a hacked information policy or not  Guess not anymore.  Apparently it  39 s ok to talk about hacked materials  so long as you don  39 t show proof  i.e. the actual documents.  They  39 re literally linking to the hacked material...  and it  39 s mirrored in a few places for extra transparency ...  Like tax reports   lol I see what you did there  Shitty part is people have to give them their social security number so a leak like this is not good at all  I never gave them that.  They have my phone number and email address  but so does FB and Twitter.  I think the big problem is that if you verified yourself as a real person  you had to take a picture of your ID  typically a driver  39 s license.  I never did that  but I bet a ton of others did.  I didn  39 t trust it.  Seems that was the appropriate call.  Yeah  I am kind of baffled by it. I never really saw SSN prompts or driver license prompts. I was curious to create an account months ago and pop my head around type of thing. I have done that a lot for up and coming social media platforms.  wow  and I thought a phone number was intrusive.  phone number was enough for me to nope the platform.  Facebook does that shit too  if your profile name comes into question or your profile gets reported too much for anything they just default to shutting you down til you provide an ID.  How ironic  when most don t need ID to vote  Instagram does that too  Same here.  I was going to sign up a few weeks ago and that stopped me dead in my tracks.  Thats what im concerned about  I was verified as a real person and I didn  39 t have to do that  How did the whole SSN rumor get started    I think it is required if you want a higher account like an  influencer  or something   but not just a regular account  It was a deliberate lie told by the Tech Fasc left and weirdo fanatics from rival platforms like GAB.  I read somewhere on reddit you have to verify yourself that way. Was on this sub somewhere. Can anyone shed some light   I read that too but it never happened to me. I never posted or anything though  I was on the site for like 5 mins.  I believe you needed to provide a pic of your ID to become a verified user  but you could use the site with just an email or phone number.  1   Your ID shouldn  39 t have your SSN on it.  What about your phone number   I dont think this is a thing  at least for people who are just creating accounts. I made a parlor account specifically looking for it to ask for my ssn  but it never did.  Yea i had a parler account and all they asked for was a phone number and email. The whole  quot they ask for id and your SIN number is just rumour bs started by rivals looking to suppress speech.  I joined and looked into it out of pure curiosity. First off   as long as you aren  39 t using a flagged IP address like a VPN  you won  39 t get the sms verification  so I was able to join by just using a cellular network with a fake phone number and only had to complete a 6 letter captcha.   Yea  i didint bother with the checkmark thing. I did it with my cell number for two step security to protect my account.  lol  next week in news. Entire mall labeled as terrorist organization mysteriously burned to the ground by mostly peaceful protestors.  Lmao so a repeat of this summers   39 peacefull protests  39 .  No app EVER should be asking for that.  Why would you even think they ask for that in the first place   Have you ever seen an app do that in your entire life   Why would researchers release the actual data instead of just white papering the exploit   Security Researchers sounds less threatening. They wouldn t accidentally leak something lol.  Security researchers is leftist speak for hackers  The right hacks the left researchers  This terminology isn  39 t a left and right thing.  Only when it  39 s an  quot acceptable target quot   Because the data is basically meaningless. Look what was written.   Yeah I  39 m calling bs on Parler being hacked  sounds like script kiddie shit  Agree  Lol this  i can imagine not a lot of people here are tech savvy but a web scraper is reality easy to build and can scrape public data on most websites. This wasn t some sort of data breach.  Because it was  as you say  scrapes save  em public  em  data  but these trash got access to  em private  em  data helped by information how to do so given by Twilio.   quot Ahhh whoops quot   Real security researchers don t do that because it s unethical. Activists and lefty shitstains do that because  revolution  nothing less  and their glorification infatuation with Marxism.  check her name.  a  quot researcher quot  indeed  They  39 re hacktivists  not researchers.  They want the data so they can report people to the FBI.  Except  they  39 re basically just going to report anyone because they are wholly intolerant of people with differing opinions.  In what admittedly small time I spent on Parler  nobody was talking about insurrections  violence  or any other illegal activity.  Most were basically just using it as a way to disseminate information.    No it won  39 t.  Parler  39 s lawyers dumped them too.  Thank god there are more than 1 lawyer in the world  They got a lawsuit filed against AWS today.  who is they  parler got a lawsuit filed against aws    a href  https   www.courtlistener.com docket 29095511 1 parler llc v amazon web services inc   https   www.courtlistener.com docket 29095511 1 parler llc v amazon web services inc   a   I can assure you that there are lawyers who want a piece of Twilio.  I don  39 t have the time to go to law school real quick and do it myself  but surely there  39 s a lawyer somewhere who is willing to take this on.  I  39 m sure a normal company can find a lawyer to represent them in this ridiculous case.  I am from a very litigious state and it  39 s BS to act like Parler can  39 t find a lawyer when I  39 ve seen  for example  a dude faking being disabled and suing lingerie stores for being handicap accessible  find a lawyer  Even if dumped  that  39 s still a legit cause for a lawsuit.  Believe me  there s always another lawyer when you pay your bills.  Oh boy. I brought this up a month or so ago  telling people that Parler asking for personal information such as a HOME PHONE NUMBER and or payment information was very questionable and that their database could get infiltrated.      Well  since many are unaware  the leaders behind Parler are the same people who created Cambridge Analytica. Anyone else surprised   I  39 m sure many online services do this.  I think several do. When I was deleting a service that I no longer used in the past I asked them to not only deactivate my account but also remove my data. They said they wouldn  39 t and after talking to a customer service person for a while they told me to just change all my personal  info  name  email  phone number  to something else before I deactivated.  This is the best course of action with anything online. I haven  39 t seen it in awhile  but occasionally you  39 ll come across comments on reddit where it states the user used some program service to overwrite all of their posts.  It s pretty common. Users accidentally delete stuff  then want it back. Ok fine we ll just flip the  deleted  flag.   Oh  THAT makes it perfectly okay then.  s  Yes.  Make sure that if you ever delete your reddit account that you use something like shreddit  or similar  that goes through and overwrites as much of your history as it can.  Won  39 t matter.  There are continuous archives being made daily of the entire comment database.  Anyone who was sufficiently motivated could roll the whole thing back to any given date.  I still use Nuke Reddit History periodically  though.  You should periodically start new accounts and lie about your life details.  Or better yet  concoct a consistent fake identity.  I have a whole fake narrative where I talk about being an old guy  living in a city  being married with kids  etc.  Or just don  39 t say anything relevant anyways    True.  But this way if you do let some truth slip out the signal to noise ratio is favorable.  By law they are required to do this for up to a year.  It  39 s just in case any kind of investigation has to be made against the person who deleted their account to hide criminal activity.  This is common because of future features like restoring posts and what not. As a dev  we often place flags that mark stuff as deleted instead of actually deleting it.. there are a bunch of reasons for it. I m always in favor of deleting things for the record  but sometimes there s reasons that we can t because of limitations in the way the software was developed or the way the infra is  You re a fool if you believe most web applications hard delete user data. It s all soft delete  They kept it  then they leaked it.  It  39 s really fucking sad that people are conditioned to think that  39 s hunky dory.  It  39 s NOT.  Fuck Parler.  Every online service does this. They store it as deleted. This is why you simply have to be careful about what you post in the first place.  Others do this as well.  Part of it is because you don  39 t want to accidentally delete things that weren  39 t supposed to be.  I can tell you this definitely happens in live environments.  Yeah that s really fucked up. That s our data  and if I want it deleted it should be gone. That marketing saying always rings true  if you ain t paying for it  you re the product.  Doxxing everyone who uses Parler just for being conservative is gross.  Thus where we are. I asked on a post on another sub what people will do once they ve gotten every conservative fired from their jobs  response I got was  live peaceful lives   I m permanently disabled  so I really have nothing to lose by voicing my opinion  Wait until you lose your disability.   removed   I work for a very conservative small independent company so I m good.   removed   I m in Texas  you think we would adhere to a lockdown   Abbot will tell them to fuck off  Have no idea but I imagine not. Thinking of moving there actually  great place for people with real intelligence. Texas will always have a place in my heart.  It really is great to live here.  Abbott has made it very clear  multiple times that this will not happen. Do I believe him  He  39 s a politician. Just keep your ears up and eyes open.   em laughs in Nebraskan  em   Joke s on you  they re going to re able you just to get you fired  The reality is that the entire world would collapse harder than the great depression.  It could be fun to watch for us country boys...  Even you country boys use modern stuff you buy in a store. You  39 re on Reddit  which means at a bare minimum you have a cellphone or laptop with an internet connection. I  39 m guessing you didn  39 t build said electronic device with materials you harvested from the earth beneath your feet with your own two hands. You farm  Educated guess says you have a whole hell of a lot of tractors and such. Or are you just some country bumpkin held up in a ratty log cabin in the hills somewhere  without so much as a Social Security number  Clearly not  because again  you  39 re on Reddit. Shit goes pear shaped  it is going to affect EVERYONE in this country. It will affect some more than others  but it will be incredibly detrimental to all of us.  Pretty sure it would be the exact opposite  Imagine two economies  one conservative and capitalistic but with some bare bones regulations to avoid monopolies  one run by AOC and Bernie Sanders. Lol  The only way this could happen is if you had a spaceship that could take you to another planet.   We  39 ve already played the  quot go start your own country quot  card  the Earth is fresh out of those.  Just gotta wait for Elon Musk to get Mars ready for us.  I  39 d consider living on a frigid  airless  waterless  irradiated dusty rock if it meant being 33 million miles away from progressives.  I saw a funny meme about that. Something like  quot you need to accept us into your space quot    gt   quot you need to add our regulations to avoid offending people quot    gt   quot if you don  39 t like it make your own space quot  and the cycle repeats.  What if you could sign up for a government like you do for health insurance  You choose one and abide by their laws  receive their benefits  pay their taxes and incur their debts. You only switch side during open enrollment every 6 years. Sure  traffic laws and others would be shared by all. But taxes and social safety nets could vary.  They think if they take everything they can from 75 million people that there will be peace   Don  39 t be silly they  39 ll just redefine peace.  Reality is not an obstacle for pathologically insane.   removed   That will also be when they find out how everything was paid for.  Just like all the people in China  So peaceful   It s turned into a witch hunt. Never thought I d see the day.  Nah  Witch Hunts have always been political purges   even in Salem and Medieval Europe.  This has been the leftist  39 s end game since 2016.  Trump wasn t supposed to win in 2016. Clinton was supposed to be CCP s ticket to the White House then. Trump foiled their plans  and has been making it worse for them ever since  thus their seething hatred.  1877.  Yeah I  39 m wondering if we should get the heck outta New England and move to Florida or Texas where they still have some semblance of freedom...  As a Floridian  I recommend Texas.   removed    removed   Welcome to why I  39 m hesitant to make a Gab or Parler account. This terrifies me.   removed   Why  You can just say  quot well I have an Instagram  Facebook   whatever   does that make me a liberal  quot   quot If I have both  am I both  quot  Maybe it means you  39 re one of those dirty independents   .  Sure  words and logic will convince them   Hmm I made a Parler account back in November just to see what it is. I never used it since and never put my personal info on it. I wonder if I  39 m on AOC  39 s list   No one out anything personal on it unless they wanted to on their own. I ve had an account and it was as easy as Twitter  It  39 s ok  they justified it by outright lying in the very first sentence of the article and saying Parler was  quot used to plan the storming of the US Capitol quot .   Also there weren  39 t just conservatives on there...  Conservative holocaust is starting.  My instincts to stay off Parler are paying off  especially when they wanted all that personal information. That was a hard nope for me. Also   quot security researchers quot  is pretty funny.  This is why I never got a Parler. You had to identify yourself. The internet should be anonymous.  You only had to if you wanted a verified badge. You could use it without it.  This is true. They did this as a verified status like the blue checkmark on Twitter.  It was optional actually  Except you need to supply a phone number to even sign up.  I signed up and used it for a bit then left. Guess I  39 m fucked. Like an idiot I used my actual email address too.  In the article there is a link where you can see if your stuff was included in the leak.  TY. Didn  39 t see that link. I  39 m safe for now apparently.  There were several things in that article that pissed me off  but the opening sentence   We lost control when we became more concerned about views clicks  and likes then we did ACTUALLY PRESENTING FACTUAL INFORMATION.  The response is going to draw more support for radicals on both sides. The whole thing is a mess  I liked it better when journalists didn t editorialize in every article.   strong Leaked  strong  by  em security researchers  em  Yep this is 100  newskpeak   quot Security researchers quot   The entire government was hacked by Russia  and no one is talking about it  A lot of people have been talking about russia interfering in US politics for several years now. I mean  em a lot  em  of content has been said and written about that topic.   quot security researchers quot   looks like im changing my phone number and never signing up to parler or twitter or any other social media that asks for my phone number.  Well  I sure am glad I never signed up on Parler.   quot Since  don enby did not carry out the data scrape secretively  there s little to worry about from an ethics perspective. However  Alkhatib agrees that if the data scrape was targeted towards minority groups  there d be a lot more to worry about. quot  These people are literally insane.  What  39 s amazing is that the criminal hacker who did this just openly brags about it on Twitter like nothing will happen to her.  Everything she stole is fruit of the poisoned tree.  She is both civilly and criminally liable for anything that happens to Parler users as a result of her crime.  That s if we had impartial judges and rule of law.  I  39 m glad they are getting rid of mean evil violence promoting Parler.  One might think these  quot security researchers quot  were given access by Amazon itself.  Democrats are fascists.  Don  39 t be afraid to call them out on it  either.  They really are   deleted    Researchers    the beginning of the democrat  39 s own  em stasi  em   The Twitter user talking about the information said it  39 s all public information. Only posts that were publicly available.  Parler makes you give them a phone number.  Is this why I got a weird fucking text message accusing me of being a Trump Supporter from an IL area code     The corpo fascists at it again   quot researchers quot   By Amazon  Is this confirmed  Wouldn  39 t they just dump the data so people could go through it and see if their coworkers are on the list like with Ashley madison.   They want you living in fear.  Well  when the opposition resource is hit financially by PTB  all aspects of it are hit and security is an expensive part.   Uh huh  leaked. I knew this fucking shit was a honey pot. Thankfully I didn  39 t use the site.  Am I woefully ingnorant about Parler.  I joined to see what is there this summer and it was kind of boring.  Loads of  quot AOC dumb quot  and  quot don  39 t vote for communism quot  meme type comments so I stopped scrolling through there.  I joined more as an F you to twitter than because I love social media. Did I miss some part where they  39 re calling for assassinations or something   and that  39 s why i never use anything tied to me anymore.  If I didn  39 t work for my family  39 s company I  39 d be scared for my job right now. This is disgusting.
t3_kve4hv,Idaho internet company blocks Facebook Twitter over censorship,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kve4hv/idaho_internet_company_blocks_facebook_twitter/,If the dems don  39 t have a problem of these companies blocking people  then they shouldn  39 t complain  Yeah  but Washington state ....   They will do something.   Idaho and Montana   well we are the last hold out up here.  Also  allowing a ISP to block a webpage is just as bad don  39 t you think   Yes it s just as bad. I don t know how the answer to censorship is more censorship  We re as the ass end of this shit  it all needs to stop  Yeah  I think I  39 m with you   more censorship doesn  39 t feel like the answer.  Fight fire with fire. Fuck em. Gab.com is better anyway  Exactly Mutually Assured Destruction  Fuck them  This is why net neutrality is so important.  What goes around  comes around. Right Dorsey   I  39 d be pretty pissed off if my ISP pulled this. They implemented because people called in complaining  saying they don  39 t want their children on the sites. Come on  fucktard  be a parent and configure your  em home  em  network then  and block whatever you want. Or take your kids phone away. I get it guys but this is such a bullshit play for an ISP to make.  Or buy a router that lets you block stuff like that. It s not that difficult to do it at the home level.  Yeah that  39 s what I meant by configure your home network...I don  39 t think you can even buy a router that doesn  39 t let you block shit anymore.  That  39 s what I  39 m saying  this is a matter of a lot of people  39 s freedoms. I don  39 t use that shit  but if I wanted to I should be able to.  They asked for the ISP to block it to their home specifically  this ISP figured they  39 d get less requests to turn the site on for an address than to turn it off.  Ahahahahah in the article it claims that blocking it violates net neutrality laws. These oligarchs can t have it both ways. Oh how the turn tables  Weren  39 t those laws taken down by ajit pai   Federal  effectively yes.  Says they will continue to offer the sites to people who ask for them. Not a lot of teeth there...  They have to take the extra step of opting in.  Right now  Yeah you  39 re right. If a competitor is able to arise though then putting barriers in front of them helps any competitor  Nope. Don  39 t like this either. This is how we end up with  quot bundled quot  internet services.  I would immediately drop my ISP if they pulled this. Two wrongs don t make a right  and at the end of the day I just want to be left alone and not told what to do think. This really annoys me.  You are assuming there are other options. Rural internet can be kinda difficult to find sometimes.  Hey man someone  39 s gotta take a stand  clearly it  39 s not you  lol.  Sweet  Isn t this just more censorship  Don t fight fire with fire.  yes  they violated the internet company  39 s  quot policies quot .  I don t want to start playing this game.  If they really want to twist the knife claim its over threats of violence on their platforms.  Rock on.  quot Its their isp  they can do what they want with it quot  get fukt commies  Works for me  as long as there  39 s healthy competition in the ISP space  which there is not.  I agree  there is plenty of competition in social media.  I can use Facebook.  Wait.  Instagram  oh damnit.  I ll use Twitter  my post is disputed.  Ok  I ll use Parler.  Oh  shit.  Good competition.  Guess MySpace still is a thing   Gab.com is going to put a hurtin  39  on twitter and facebook. Great UI. Will be faster by end of week.  Now block Amazon for AWS  Parler.  A lot of violence is actually caused by twitter  the more you know  That s a fight back of rang.  That  39 s it. If I can get a job in Idaho I  39 m moving.  Inciting violence isn t free speech. No one cares what northern Idaho does. It s full of extremist. Anyone driving from MT to WA will tell you to not stop.  Amazingly awesome    removed   sounds like something EVERY SANE AMERICAN needs to do  I can t wait to move to Idaho  Good for them  I wish more companies would do this.  Good.

The rest of the shows... not so much.   quot we hate conservatives  but we  em really  em  hate liberals quot    matt stone  That quote is more than ten years old now.   South Park made an episode apologizing to Al Gore for making fun of his global warming hysterics in the original man bear pig episode. They ve gotten soft.  That  39 s nice depending on if matt stone is a socialist  quot progressive  quot  or more of a libertarian. Sometimes people call themselves libertarian but are actually begging for Marxism.  Sometimes people just hate politics and don  39 t care enough to have a side.  Everyone has an opinion  some people have just given it less thought.  Well put.  SNL is no longer a entertainment show but more of an indoctrination show.  Wait a few months  Biden will call a foreign leader the wrong name and they  39 ll start making jokes about him being the oldest president to be elected. At some point in the next four years we  39 ll see Jim Carey riding a rascal scooter in a white wig yelling about missing the early bird buffet at the Capital dining hall.   I always liked Mad TV more. Half their stuff wouldn t be made today. Miss Swan haha.  What would happen if SNL brought back pat   I think Pat would be welcomed actually because she d be an enby lol. The actress that played her wanted to keep the mystery but said someone came up to her and knew Pat was a woman because of how she kissed the male actor in their skit. She responded like a woman  because she is a woman  and the actress thought it was a funny tell.  Frank Caliendo  has an amazing mimicry. Too bad his show never got off the ground.   I loved mad tv  and ms swan. it s not my fault the Asian accent is both ugly and funny. If Asians don t want to get made fun of  don t move here. Simple really. Or get rid of the accent. American Asians are a little less funny.  As a kid I never thought it was truly mocking Asians. She was just a kind of frustrating or annoying but hilarious woman.  eh  not really true. You might just not be watching enough left media to see it.   This is a great observation. It needs to be highlighted more. I wonder if the Bee can satirize this concept in a way that really nails it so people will notice.  I m just happy I live in the US  a country where politicians aren t silenced.  Twitter objects   Is this satire   How do you handle real world scenarios where jokes don t have satire tags  Of course I m joking   It was a rhetorical question  but idk with this sub anymore  most seem to be boot licking  or at least concern trolling.  The quote should have been him saying he doesn  39 t even go there.  How is the left going to fill their day once Trump is out of office  They suffer from TDS so much that I dont think they will know what to do come January 21st.  Finally  a peaceful solution to get rid of orange man   Maybe if he  39 s no longer orange they won  39 t dislike him   It bothers me how politicians go crazy on the tan spray. We get it. More people think it  39 s not okay to be white than think it  39 s not okay to be dark  and you need the votes of those mortally deficient people too.  Just make it a little more subtle.  To be fair  he  39 s not as  quot Orange quot  as they make him seem. They punch up the saturation when they put pictures of him up.  Saturation or not  orange will always be a stereotype for people who use artificial tans. It doesn  39 t matter if it  39 s the President or Jersey Shore.  Oh  I agree  but they try to make it more than it is because they think it  39 s an epic burn.  This one is a miss. 
t3_kvf47p,Idaho Internet Provider Blocks Facebook Twitter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvf47p/idaho_internet_provider_blocks_facebook_twitter/,Lmao the war of who can cancel who  Except they re not canceling these sites despite what the headline would lead you to believe. This article clearly says they will continue to offer them to customers who want them  and will block them for customers who want them blocked.  So.  Like a router.  ISPs definitely have the upper hand in this war. Unfortunately  the  majors   AT amp T  Comcast  Charter Spectrum  Verizon  etc  are all liberal media conglomerates so good luck getting them to join in. It will be up to the small regional ISPs to take charge  and most of their customers are the same ones who abandoned the majors because of their shitty business practices to begin with.  There  39 s always a bigger fish  This is like the end of War Games where HAL virtually cancels the US and Russia  RHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE     Keep going  there  39 s more states.  Good to note. A company blocking service to a widely popular website despite it being a toxic dumpster fire despite what people want  is equally unjustified  What  39 s the point of blocking it if you don  39 t use it   Workplaces   I  39 m sure gonna hurt the ad revenue.  The provider isnt blocking BF and twitter across the board.  It requires users to request a block on them.  What  39 s the point in requesting a block if you don  39 t use it in the first place   Maybe in search engines FB stuff not gonna show up. Maybe reaching young audience will be hard now too. Dont know but should have some negative effect.  Free market this bitches  Exactly  2 can play at this game Zuck.  Amusing.  Not quite apples to apples since neither Facebook nor Twitter have a legal arrangement with this ISP to host their services.  Suck it Fuckerberg.  Man this picture of the fuckerberg really captures what a psycho he is.  God bless them. Hope more follow suit.  I like this.  It really raises the question  if one believes in the principles of net neutrality  should it extend to all internet infrastructure vendors such as AWS.  This is one of the most based things I  39 ve heard of in a long time.    Love it. Good for them. We can pressure twitter advertisers and our isps as well folks.  About time we fight fire with fire.  Time to email my ISP  Fake doubt. They can  39 t even use the correct whether  weather  right. Not to mention the ISP is really  really insignificant. Don  39 t play the ISP ban war. Comcast  att etc will NOT side with us. Besides  this sourced from a Twitter post. Please don  39 t post this garbage.  Haha awesome  Ultra Based  Wow  can  39 t believe that some homies from the 509 had enough balls to do this. Major respect for my fellow Spokanites
t3_kvhzji,Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Its time that we simply put wokeism to sleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvhzji/secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo_its_time_that_we/,IS THAT A THREAT        SEDITIOOOON REEEEEEEEEE  Nancy.... Didn  39 t know you had so many alt accounts.   Hang on do I hear Mike Pompeo...  He s literally worse than Hitler. Words are violence.  It s not his words. It s what I assume the meaning to be behind his words. That s my truth.  But his presence is alone is violence. And silence is violence.  I  39 m literally shaking right now  With their big brain logic  me liking vanilla ice cream could be inciting violence  because someone else might not like it and attack someone who eats vanilla ice cream because I like it. This is a mental illness.  No  their logic works like this   This guy has stuck beside Trump and has balls because the DC swamp will punish anyone for being trump friendly at this point.   deleted   Him  Sidney Powell  Gen. Flynn and the Stop the Steal guys need a comic book about Patriots fighting fascism  Sleep  Kill it. Kill it with fire.  Nuke it from orbit.  EXTERMINATUS  There goes Mike  39 s Twitter account   Do you mean president Pompeo    pompeo 2020 when all of Congress is jailed  Yo  Pompeo fucks  He fucks his wife no doubt  and maybe even your mother. But the good thing is he would never dog you about it in public like Trump would on Twitter.  Dreams  I would love to see a President Pompeo VP DeSantis presidency.  He and Pence are really doing a great job right now despite all that s going on.  He realizes the truth which is the entire Trump Administration can  39 t get any more fucked than it was the second The Big Guy won. So why not speak truth   Not going to happen.  The left and their propaganda media friends will use it to silence all opposition.  Pompeo is a good dude  good sense of humour  has honor. I think Trump and him would be good running mates.  There s no way trump will run again. Hate to say it.  Sorry yeah I wasn  39 t hoping for anything. More an alternative reality idea. I agree it would be a stretch to think trump would run again but trump has done and survived a lot of things others politicians could never manage. So I  39 m not counting him out totally.  Agreed. Finally have a guy that s putting us first and somehow within a year the media Commiecrats managed to flip the script and make him look like the asshole.   We first need to have some honest media outlets. That s the only chance we have again. The left has the entire mainstream media in their pocket. There needs to be balance and truth if we want to stand a chance  Except it s not like the toddler who constantly wants a glass of water and another story and another lullaby in a glass of milk  the toddler is actually a tiger. And we will never financially recover from this  I see the ONE woman on death row won a stay. So much for equal treatment for women. A lot more than one had done violent crimes and then when only one gets on there  people fight to get her off of it. lol.  Time to educate these leftists about Freedom  Fucking love this guy  Put to sleep with an ever so soft pillow over the face held by a person wearing a velvet glove.  I  39 m going to be very sad to see Pompeo leave the State department.  Best Secretary of State we  39 ve had in a very long time  IMO.  It s extremely toxic but I think that is by design.  If wokeism took a hike I d be one happy camper   quot Woking Dead quot  cannot be put to sleep.  Traitor
t3_kv5vj6,Trump Is Being Urged to Officially Recognize Taiwan as He Leaves Office,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv5vj6/trump_is_being_urged_to_officially_recognize/,Good. He should do it. Taiwan should have the right to autonomy from China.  He should  because Biden won t have the balls to do it  and nor will he have the balls to walk it back .  I  39 m not sure it takes balls to walk it back.  The CCP will exert pressure like never before.  They ll lower the budget on Hunter s drugs and trafficked girls money.  biden is too in bed with china to dare even think about it.  It will be really bad optics when Biden walks it back too.  But china has been preparing for this war  you are really going to put them out.  I just attempted to post a response to the ccp hacker questions and got booted off the webpage.  Should recognize Hong Kong  Taiwan  and Tibet while calling out China as human rights abusers.  Fuck the CCP   I have concerns the CCP has already infiltrated the United States. Housing investments  banking  tech  government officials  news media outlets  and other entire industries. The use of news propaganda within the US is strikingly similar to the CCP.  And the people who absorb the propaganda are all repeating the same things  as if they ve been consumed by an ideology and have lost a sense of personal experience.    quot For all mankind quot   The situation that we  39 re heading into is even worse than China  39 s. In China  corporations are forced to answer to the government. In a Democrat run America  the government is forced to answer to corporations. And corporations have no loyalty to their countrymen  only to the highest international bidder.  Feinstein s driver was a Chinese spy  and at her side for 20 years.  Agreed. It is really suspicious how the media treated the term  quot China virus quot  as a bigger deal than the fact that China kept the virus secret while allowing people to fly out of their country and spread it worldwide.   They very well have  My biggest fear  as a dude who spent 4 years there.  Well considering the guy who just stole the election is bought and paid for by China  I  39 d say you are correct.   Im just curious  what ramifications would this have  Would that be something biden would try to  undo    Acknowledging them is merely symbolic  but China would pressure Biden to deny their independence. It s basically just Trump putting Biden in a lose lose situation.  I like the sound of that.  I don  39 t   even those on the left abhor the practices of the ccp. With Biden taking office they can only demonize trump for so long before they need a new devil.  Better that energy be channeled towards actual violators of human rights.  China is not  Yeah  there are others. But common man   It would piss off China and could potentially lead to a regional conflict. Though China knows Trump is on his way out so they would put their pressure on Biden to recant. It would make Biden look bad if he did.  Why not   Cause the US government are pussies  You can  39 t recognize Hong Kong. It was in the rules to give it back.  It  39 s a dumb move. Don  39 t you play civ.  He should do it. It s up to America which states we recognize. The CCP doesn t give us a veto over their foreign policy.  Lol  might as well do it    He should do all he can while he has a chance to.  It s a smart idea  force Biden to reverse it on the record and confirm  BeijingBiden for all to see.  Cos we all know Biden isn  39 t gonna do it as it would upset the money from his ccp businesses.  And itll be interesting to see Biden backtrack it.  This would be a incredibly moral thing to do. Taiwan deserves freedom.  That would definitely make Biden  39 s Chinese masters angry.   removed   Chinese taxes pay Biden  not the other way around.  He  39 s  quot the big guy quot .  Pardon Snowden and order all troops home while your at it.  Snowden would likely have to remain on the run. A presidential pardon won  39 t mean anything to the deep state gremlins he pissed off.  Doesn  39 t mean he shouldn  39 t still be pardoned.  Agreed.  I agree with Snowden but pulling everyone out at the same time is a bad idea.  Pardoning Snowden would be amazing. I hate how he gets lumped into a group with assange.  President Trump should recognize the Republic of China  Taiwan  as the one and only genuine representative of China. The CCP should be seen as an illegitimate entity in the eyes of American foreign policy.  Yes  it  39 s time we make this cold war public. It  39 s been going on silently for decades  and the American people should know who their real enemy is  Yes   and that includes showing the American nation the real enemy pulling the strings behind Biden. Xi   It  39 s tempting  but not not particularly practical given existing treaties and the UN Security Council. Plus  while I doubt Biden would have the balls to walk back Taiwan recognition  you can be damn sure he  39 d reverse what you propose immediately. So if the end goal is benefiting Taiwan  the more moderate course proposed by others here is the superior options.  Do it. Fuck China  JUST DO IT   We never should have recognized the CCP.  Communist governments are illegitimate by definition.  The rightful government has always been the original republican government that the Communists exiled to Taiwan after the takeover of Beijing.  If I recall my history correctly  Taiwan held China  39 s seat in the UN until we wrongly recognized the Communist government in the 70s.  Correct but US recognition of the PRC over ROC and the UN seat switching from ROC to PRC happened separately but in a relatively short time frame from one another.  I assumed that there was a correlation. Either way that was far before my time.  Yea well hes being urged to do alot he doesn  39 t seem to care about or have the guts to do unfortunately  Yes definitely   Recognize Taiwan  Tibet and Hong Kong. Last act will be remembered in the history  YES  Do it.  Definitely should recognize Taiwan.  This should be supported across the aisle  China is gonna steamroll Taiwan now because Biden will do nothing except issue a strongly worded statement.  Yep. He  39 ll issue a  quot red line quot  and about two seconds later China will cross over it without a care in the world.  Just like obummer did  Man  when I read this  I was like helllll yeeeesss  This is another reason Democrats are trying to rush Trump out. He is going to kick some ass on the way out.  Too late.  Should have been done day one.  The U.S. has not officially recognized Taiwan because the policy of the U.S. since Nixon and Kissinger opened up the PRC was to pretend Taiwan was just a separatist group that would eventually reunite with the mainland.  I thought they were already recognized as a country  Wow that sucks. I guess Taiwan is in the same situation as Hong Kong and Tibet. China is terrible  Thankfully Taiwan doesn  39 t have to live under the totalitarian heel of China link Hong Kong and Tibet do  but it  39 s so sad how so many governments and companies bow down before the CCP.  It  39 s sickening.  Why did we not already do this years ago  Doesn  39 t Taiwan not want this  They consider themselves the rightful government of china and thus part of china  not just Taiwan.  You re getting downvoted but it s a good question.  Are 3 and 4 not the same   3 refers to the US recognizing  a country separate from China called Taiwan  and 4 refers to the US recognizing  two countries that both make up China.  Sorry for the lack of clarity but the entire China and Taiwan subject is a ridiculous headache because there are so many logistical name related issues.  True. Thank you for the clarification.  It s the right thing to do and it screws Beijing 10  for the big guy  Biden. Perfect policy.  Nothing says successful president like starting a war a week before you leave office.  Embassy in Taiwan or bust. China plans to invade on April 1 remember that  The only thing that can save Taiwan.  This would be great.  Fuck yea do it.  Idk if it makes sense recognize Hong Kong if the British treaty did specify they d give it back to China.   You know what  Why the hell not at this point   Please   And Hong Kong  Tibet  and East Turkmenistan as well   Well the problem with Hong Kong is that it isn  39 t independent at all. It  39 s not an autonomous state that China claims as theirs. It legitimately is China  39 s at the moment  not that I  39 m happy about that . That would be like China recognizing Puerto Rico  39 s independence.  Not to mention the US has a consulate  not an embassy  in Hong Kong so that d complicate things.  Taiwan doesn  39 t want to be recognized as Taiwan. They want to be recognized as China. Doing so would flip the table on US Chinese relations. China would 100  cancel any trade with the US. Now I would totally be in favor of that but I doubt any politician is willing to mix things up like that. It would be great to see Trump do it and then leave Biden in the awkward position of having to renounce it though.  Taiwan wants to be recognized period. The entire  should we remain de jure China or get rid of the Chinese label  debate is mostly predicated on the fact that most people don t see themselves as Chinese  last I checked the percentage of Taiwanese who saw themselves as Chinese was less than ten percent  but reluctantly continue to call themselves China because otherwise the CCP might get angry and start an annexation campaign.  Yeah early on you had a bunch of exiles wanting to return to the mainland but their kids and grandkids started to identify with a separate Taiwanese identity instead.  Brilliant   Remember fuck communist China.  Fuck it  if he  39 s gonna scorched earth on his way out  might as well do something good with it  Oh God please yes. One last F U to China would be great  PLEASE DO   Do it.  Do it 
t3_kv86zb,Rand Pauls Wife Blasts Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey For Allowing Threats Against Her Husband,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv86zb/rand_pauls_wife_blasts_twitter_ceo_jack_dorsey/,It  39 s because he is white and a republican  no other excuse needed and it  39 s being heralded by the democrat elites to boot.  No other excuse   The Scalise shooting was in 2017   Jesus  feels like a decade ago.  Its sad to see how toxic our politics have become.  They  39 re still doing it. Fucking Biden and Harris were out there going  quot but if this was a BLM protest the police would have reacted differently. quot   it took them an afternoon to clean that shit up in DC.  The congresscreatures were back in there finishing the vote  em that night  em .  No it s  white supremacy   which is consistent with the view that the status quo is racist.  Twitter is a total double standard. There is only Leftist drivel there.  Speaking of leftist drivel  I really wish Mark Hamill would just keep his mouth shut about politics.  The more I see from him  the more I want to hate Star Wars.  Just think how good an actor he is to solidify the illusion of Luke Skywalker while the whole time he  39 s just a mindless dolt. But  yeah  it  39 d help if he kept his mouth shut.  Most of the people who supported Joe Biden are morons anyway  Jack Dorsey is now  em personally responsible  em  for every hateful Tweet.  Jack is a bitch boy.  Reading a book og his called The Presidents  39  Prayers. Recommend it.  Also idk if that is the exact name but close enough 
t3_kv2nfd,Instagram just pulled one of our posts for violence and incitement ... It was a screenshot of Twitters trending topics. The irony is beautiful.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv2nfd/instagram_just_pulled_one_of_our_posts_for/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  https   discord.gg conservative  a   They  39 re also banning accounts outright that posted an AOC tweet about protesting from a month ago  what about posting the Colin Kapernick tweet calling for violence in the streets  or the Iranian ayatollah  39 s many tweets calling for the genocide of jews   Basically if you use something against someone  as long as it  39 s not Trump  you run risk of getting banned   removed   The fascists are on the march. They re being emboldened.  Whenever I bring up this argument the counter argument is  quot Trump is President of the United States. He should be held to a higher standard quot . You cannot convince these people.  Get ready for another 4 years of being called racist if you disagree with her or her policies.  She is a POC after all.  I think you mistyped POS.  Get ready for 4 years of being a targeted enemy of the State.  Not a chance.  You just try to hold her to a standard  ya sexist   Lol no bro. Mental gymnastic rules allow for anyone on the left to be exempt  Decades of brainwashing will do that. The left perpetually has the moral high ground  no matter what according to them.  Lmao I definitely had a lefty friend tell me he s grown and worked on his morals after I asked him why he makes one snarky comment to my posts and doesn t have a conversation. Followed by some shit about focusing positivity and love lmao. What I m seeing is wild  we need people in straight jackets lol  And Jack Dorsey supporting Kaepernick right afterwards...  3mil worth of support to be exact  Well you see that  39 s different   I  39 ve come to some conclusions about the difference between the left and the right after seeing how things have been playing out with recent events.  The left also seems to overreact. But that could be a related side effect.  You just figured this out   embarrassingly  yes. I knew that the left always seems to come down on whatever side of an issue that benefits them  but the thinking behind it didn  39 t occur to me until recently.   Welcome to the discussion we been trying to get through peoples heads for years. Why is it so damn hard   Everyone likes to think that they themselves are normal. Anything that deviates from that is looked at as being undesirable. So when someone sees something on opposite ends of the spectrum from themselves  it  39 s seems unbelievable or  em not normal  em ...and that makes people uncomfortable. In turn  they avoid it.   Yea you  39 re right.. difficult and frustrating for those of us that have been trying to say these things our whole life. Tired of feeling like we are talking to a wall of know it all that know nothing apparently.  Welcome to the club. We  39 ve been trying to tell people this all over reddit for years  Do you have a link to an image of that tweet   Not the Bee the site that has articles so absurd you wod they were satire but aren  39 t  now has an article about something they posted.  Crazy.  Big tech  we ve censored  banned and de platformed all conservative voices.  More like  Sounds like 4chan. White supremacist symbol  anyone   Would have been totally okay if a left leaning outlet had posted it though.  How long before the bee is kicked off hosting platforms  You are strictly forbidden from directly quoting us.  No  the irony is Not beautiful.  It  39 s scary.  Truly.  Instagram is owned by Facebook  of course.  WE are moving in the direction of countries like Canada  where posting facts  like government crime stats  is considered a crime punishable by prison.  Authoritarian figures like Hitler and Stalin would ve wished they lived in our timeline.  My wife defected from the Soviet world in the   39 80  39 s. She watches CNN and says... quot I do to know that tone. I have to be heard these words before. These people are to be very dangerous. quot   Maybe they do    Oh for sure.   They are the most powerful propaganda tools in human history. Nothing is as effective or easy to use to brainwash the masses.  No  they  39 d have been ineffectual as politicians.  And the United Kingdom   where a  a href  https   www.telegraph.co.uk news uknews crime 11069178 Rotherham researcher sent on diversity course after raising alarm.html  researcher employed by the Home Office was sent on  quot diversity training quot  after observing mostly men from the Indian subcontinent were sexually abusing young white girls  a .  Yep  this exactly the stuff.  Does that exist in Canada  Please give me an example  They  39 re likely referring to C 16 bill  which at first I thought it was outlawing misgendering transsexual people.   Hate Facts  Yup.  Sorry bub. You skipped Canada and went straight to China.  Yep...likely so.  Simply put  there was a coup on Jan 6th. Only it wasn  39 t the rednecks in DC who took over  it was Silicon Valley.    quot I pledge allegiance  to the terms and conditions of the United oligarchs of America... quot   Wait  where did you get that idea   communism eats itself  It  39 s going to try to eat all of us first though.  Ya that  39 s the problem  it takes millions of people to die before leftists think  quot hey... em maybe  em  this wasn  39 t such a great idea  quot . Then millions more die before it really sinks in.  Funny how Instagram suddenly cares so much about  inciting violence  yet it was given a free pass all summer. Funny how twitter and Facebook claim to care so much about  spreading misinformation  but they spread so much of it.   Yes. The question before us now is  what do we do about it   Idk. Feels pretty powerless. They say get a new app  then that app is shut down. The best thing for everyone would be to just totally get off of social media. It s the downfall of society.  That s what one part of the whole issue. I meant about the whole issue...the loss of liberty and the rise of a Chinese communist type authoritarian government.  These seemingly independent companies are functioning very much like organs in the same authoritarian  state controlled media.  They  39 re working together and  backing each other up.  They  39 re the unified voice of our new rulers.  Another how 2021 is more like 1984 than 1984.  Orwell was an optimist   Unlimited power is apt to corrupt the minds of those who possess it    Willam Pitt.  That will be the new excuse  anything posted that makes Leftism look bad will be considered  quot inciting violence. quot   I  39 m waiting for Twitter to just ban itself at this point. The rules they have put forward means the entire platform will eventually ban itself.  This is a really concerning time  in this country. We are heading down a really dark path and I don t see anything stopping it.  This crap is really unbelievable  And we  39 re just getting started. 2021 is going to be a doozy.    that s the worst part  it s just getting started.  Fuck Twitter   They are going to ban us all. They are not going to let this opportunity to stamp out populism and the movement as they may never get this chance again. They are openly saying this and have for awhile. The idiots that hurt a cop snd went in bldg instead of just gathering outside gave the left just what they needed.  This. Storming the capital was a real a dangerous  stupid  and disrespectful move  and the democrats will forever hold this against all conservatives.  Burning police stations  courthouses  etc are also equally terrible  but democrats will make sure those are forgotten .  Could be but either way it didn t help us imo  I  39 ve interviewed people who worked on the Facebook  quot Policy quot  team and left to other pastures. They  39 re very  very   very underqualified individuals who were hired straight out of college  most of them  as i understand it are either in the US on a temporary work visa from another country such as India or Turkey  or are located in dense offices of contract workers in these low cost countries.  And thus  a young Facebook employee is now back out on the job market.  Kiss my keister Twotter  I wouldn  39 t be surprised if someone is up to something locally because the radio station that has hannity  rush  beck  etc... keeps randomly having the audio of the shows go out and extremely loud buzzing noises for up to minutes at a time  then the show comes back in for a few mins  then repeat.... yesterday and today.  I love the smell of leftist irony in the morning  I am not surprised. The left continues its path to the nut house. I was banned from Salt Lake City for being a  quot terrorist sympathizer quot . I simply called the post out for telling a lie.
t3_kvcv5l,Parler sues Amazon for antitrust violation breach of contract and unlawful business interference. Asks federal judge to order Amazon to reinstate the platform,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvcv5l/parler_sues_amazon_for_antitrust_violation_breach/,I don  39 t know what their chances are of any sort of positive result  anything    but I  39 m rooting for them.  The only way Parler doesn t win is if the court system is as corrupt as some here think it is...  So they have no chance  Judge  Theres no evidence that this disruption caused damage to Parlers service   You have no evidence and are a threat to democracy for alleging this  Wait  you do have evidence  Sorry  you filed too late    quot You don  39 t have standing quot    Latches . Parler isn t even on the APP Store and doesn t even have servers. What right do they have to sue Twitter  are real social media app      It  39 s a good cause of action.  You  39 d think Parler would hire a larger  more powerful firm. Amazon is going to retain a monster.  Their previous firm dumped them because of hey didn t want to go against amazon  Parler got assigned Jimmy Carter appointee  but I have hopes. Read the complaint.  A Carter appointee.  Is this guy 95 years old   Does he even know what the internet is   I m just surprised there are any Carter appointees left lol  I read it  although I  39 m no expert on the Sherman Act. The remaining claims are fairly straight forward.  Democrats back then weren t all Stalinists  fortunately.  I can only pray.  Why was there not a backup plan  Why are they even aligned with big tech   Because we have all been encouraged to move our services onto the cloud. It was supposed to be more secure  and require less IT services. Ironically  I have been pushing my employer to deploy our services to the cloud for years  Azure web services . And my employer has been reluctant  we host our own services on premises.    This exactly.  At this rate we re going to have to etch out our own silicon wafers to make our own cpus.  I can do that ..  kinda. I  39 m pretty sure I could build a decent 8 bit computer.  I was in the process of evaluating the cost. Its really hard to do even using their calculators.  Even Amazon.com started off renting someone else s servers back in the day. You don t just go build a server of your own out of the gate.   You can buy servers from Dell  HP  IBM  and many other  39 s for less than 1000 dollars. Order 20 or so of these and you can host a pretty large website. Then you just have to pay for internet access  and you can get that from many sources.  You don  39 t need 20 servers. These machines are JUICED   Seems like a logical thing to ensure your survival though. Building a server in the 1990s is a little different than doing so in the 2020s.  If you had to build your own server every time you wanted to start a website or app  no one would get anything off the ground. The overhead would be astronomical.   If you are relying on their services  yes you are aligned with big tech. This is exactly how they continue to dominate and grow  paying for and using their services.  We do and have done so forever  but it  39 s just not as scalable as what the big cloud services provide  but that may change soon. Maybe buy Dell stock. But even Dell pushes cloud services.  We are with you  Parler   Why did they use Amazon servers in the first place  That seems like an obvious mistake.  We use Azure  but that  39 s not the real issue. The issue is between AWS and Azure that  39 s the entire market. Though  they should move the Azure and see if they are the commie cocksukers I think they are.  There s money in them Amazon hills   Send in the clowns   Oops. Lawyers   An idea someone commented to me in a different sub   Laches.  Should have sued earlier   now you  39 re already kicked off   How did they sue when they said all their lawyers dropped them   We couldn  39 t even get the courts to look at an allegedly fraudulent election. What makes you think that they would give a flying fuck about free speech on the internet   Right on   So  I read this and this seems pretty strong to me. The one problem I can see is that they really don t have the facts on the conspiracy element of the anti trust claim but that isn t necessarily unexpected at this juncture.  Nice  I m not a flaired user. My bad. Everything lately is flaired users only  and I just don t have the time to make that many comments to get flaired. Serious question  can we initiate some kind of class action lawsuit against Amazon for violating our 1st Amendment rights   Considering your 1A is in relation to the government you wouldn  39 t be successful on those grounds.  Suing in Washington  Probably a liberal judge.  Prediction  mountain of evidence disregarded  case dismissed for lack of standing.  Much harder when you claim there are  em tortious business practices.  em   Judges  you should have come to us earlier  but now that you are its too late. 
t3_kvhxyd,European Leaders Have a Lot to Say About Twitter Booting Trump None of It Good for Twitter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvhxyd/european_leaders_have_a_lot_to_say_about_twitter/,Europe gets it because they ve already seen what happens when a movement comes in and outlaws everything except for what follows the party line.  Yup  death  destruction and tanks.  Lots of tanks.  When left ass Europe starts taking Trump  39 s side you know it  39 s bad.  Yeah because everyone except for the brainwashed Americans can see through the censorship and corruption that is occurring right in front of American lives. It is so clear like crystal clear that the left is trying to eradicate anything and everything and anyone that opposes and disagrees with their narrative. Silencing  censoring  controlling  by all means to continue their ultimate plan of complete power. They have brainwashed so many people who can no longer think on their own  they hook up to their tv and social media at night and the brainwashing continues.   I agree with everything except I see this as the resurgence of America. We can all see it happening  very slowly  more and more people are seeing the hypocrisy and  em the sickness  em  of the leftists. Trump and TDS have opened many people  39 s eyes to the absolute garbage they are. We got the walkaway movement  the blexit movement  ect out of Trump. Never before could a  em Republican  em  President win so much of the culture wars. It  39 s not instantaneous  but it is happening. Trump has given people who used to stay silent a voice and it will continue to grow when he  39 s out of office  I think it actually helps when he is out of office. If Biden goes along with his leftist agendas  I see his presidency being the straw and the flood gates opening.   I  39 ll continue saying and believing that Trump isn  39 t the President or the type of President I want forever in this country  but he is 100  the President this country needs right now  will be using past tense soon . I  39 m one of the many that wished he  39 d shut the hell up and let policies do his talking but in reality we needed exactly what we got.  I agree with this. We will be fine  the left can t actually win I don t think. Not long term. People are waking up very very quickly  I agree with you on the goals of the left  but as far as European leaders it  39 s just good old fashioned self interest. They are concerned because what stops them from being next.  Dammit  Europe is ahead of the US again... high speed trains  the Autobahn  the metric system. Now free speech    lt shakes fist at sky gt   NOOOOOOOOOooooooooo........  they  39 re only saying something because they know Trump won and has the proof.  It  39 d be nice if he  39 d come out with the proof right about two months ago.  The UK and Europeans EU have been way ahead of the curve vs the US on managing the dangers of Big Tech and holding it to account.  Twitters actions have forever marked Silicon Valley as the enemy of governments the world over. They have shown the world that they are actively involved in manipulating the political process of nations. If they re able to silence the most powerful man in the world. What more can do they do someone of a lesser nation   Big tech and the media are truly the enemy of the people. They need to be dismantled  reformed  and rebuilt.  Most powerful man really only applies to Democrat presidents who have a whole media behind them. Republicans presidents don t get the same  influence  as the media turns against them usually  Hopefully the EU will do what our government will not and legislate these companies and platforms into submission.  But I thought Europe was the most enlightened place ever with  free  college and healthcare    If USA would ever organize things the same as most European countries  Capitol would be taken over by rioting professors  doctors and insurance administrators. What most people forget is that already USA Federal government   1.2 trillion  and states spend to health care the same amount of money as developed European states relative to their GDP. Money is just wasted and overspend.  Twitter has been the most useless internet tech  let s finally put Twitter to grave where it belongs   When the Europeans are criticizing you for censorship you know you ve gone too far.
t3_kv3czt,Trumps Twitter Exile Spurs Opposition From Germany France  Chancellor Merkel calls Trumps ban on Twitter problematic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv3czt/trumps_twitter_exile_spurs_opposition_from/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  https   discord.gg conservative  a   It  39 s something when even leaders who have generally been anti Trump all along are calling this out.  They  39 re afraid that if big tech can ban the President of the United States from social media what exacty stops them from banning other world leaders organizations as well   Which one is official   The damn ACLU has even sided with him. That  39 s how nutty they  39 ve gotten.   Wasn t it just one member of the ACLU   It was quite comforting to see that  though  and I hope something comes of it  When the leader of Germany  not exactly a bastion of free speech  calls you out...  The President of Mexico has condemned this as well  Its Sovereignty and respect understanding of one s differing views. Something so foreign in present day America.  So has Mexico s President....  Exactly  when Germany sees the road you are heading down with authoritarian censorship...its time to listen  Well eventually it can be them too this tech business is showing us who is in charge so             They know they are next.  What s funny is the same people who have been wringing their hands the last 4 years worried about our  perception on the world stage  now have to either explain this away or  more likely  ignore it altogether.  Cuckstin Trudeau is applauding it.  Therrrrrrre  39 s a shock  P  And somehow Netanyahu has been dead silent  Exactly my thought.  It  39 s very bad.  It  39 s easy to forget how aggressively anti trust the EU can be.  In 2004  the EU fined Microsoft the equivalent of  790M because when installing the OS for the first time  it didn  39 t prompt you to install a browser other than IE.  Well Facebook has been pulling another fast one by demanding all the data from WhatsApp can suddenly be used and sold off for profit.  If Zuck had not banned Trump  this outrageous move would have been given so much more media attention.  Thanks for reminding. That means that 230 does not have to be an American law.  Yeah it  39 s creepy as fuck how this cabal of American tech companies will all band together to protect themselves and silence people that don  39 t agree with their West Coast ideologies. I don  39 t like the Fourth Reich all that much  but they do seem to try and protect consumers  39  rights a bit better than we do here at home.  Well anti trust when it  39 s a foreign company.  Do you have any EU companies in mind  like Volkswagen Group   At first I was like  Damn  Twitter just redpilled the ACLU.   And she doesn  39 t even like Trump  so know you know you fucked up when world leaders like her are speaking out against this shit.  Other counties are lecturing the United States about freedom of speech.   countries   there  39 s an  quot r quot  in country.  This story is trending in worldnews also  comments over there are spicy...calling out reddit hypocrisy  Good looking out  hadn  39 t seen that. Always nice to see that not  em every  em  large subreddit has gotten to the point of  pics  amp   politics quite yet.  Dorsey dun fucked up  lol even foreigners know this is wrong   How can America the beacon of freedom just became the small brother of the CCP commie regime   Because our social media platforms are no longer American. They interact with the entire world. They make their profit outside America.  Lol when China bought Forbes  that was our sign  The signs go back to the 90s. Hell probably before that  I was just to young to remember.  Because we  quot elected quot  their puppet.  Yep. China found a way to play our game  without sending troops and bombs.  People have no idea what s coming.  You will either be on the right side or wrong side of history  period. Start taking notes of where your acquaintances stand  because you  39 ll want to know who you can and cannot turn to when the going truly gets tough.    It is now the Beacon of CCP in the west  America hasn  39 t been the beacon of freedom in a long while. Not since we allowed cancel culture to run unchecked.  Every political leader should be voicing their disgust with this. Trump may be on his way out  but he s still the  em sitting President of the United States  em  for God s sake  Social media expects cheers  because so many people worldwide have expressed their hatred for Trump...BUT  Even some who hate him recognize that social media has now become too powerful. And guess what  There s legal precedent for the courts to rule that private companies cannot interfere with free speech. There comes a time when the individual s rights  Trump   lol  pun unintended  my phone capitalized it by itself  personal property business property.  Exactly. You can hate Trump and still see that this is a horrifying precedent.  Does Merkel dislike Trump  I think from what I  39 ve read she does  am I wrong   She  39 s never really hid the fact that she dislikes Trump. More or less just tolerated him whenever they met lol.  This sounds like Merkel. Pragmatic  down to earth  The majority of germans dislike Trump  including the chancellor.  I don  39 t knock Germans  39  opinions of US conservativism all that much seeing as it  39 s been run through the spin cycle 8 times by our news organizations by the time it gets to their eyes and ears.  Dislike is relative. Pres T came in and asked  in his way  the EU to pay up or shut up. When you  39 re used to getting things at a discount and new leadership comes in saying the discount is over  you  39 d be a bit peeved too. In addition  it costs us a ton to sustain military presence there  while Germany makes a ton making and exporting military equipment without sustaining a strong military themselves. It all aligned with Pres T holding our allies more accountable and having some equity especially with those allies that have fairly strong economies.  Trump did try to weaken the current leaders of EU and support the dissenting voices in European Union against German and French dominant position in it. So yeah one could say Merkel has no reason to like Trump  especially since it is likely that a Democrat in the White House would likely be better for their interests.  No fucking shit  World leaders think it  39 s a bad idea to suppress a world leaders communication with the country it leads. Twitter  Facebook and Amazon along with the rest of the California tech companies that think they run the world just put the final nail in their own damn coffin. Yes  a lot of leaders in the world are corrupted by money because they care a lot about it. but you know what they care about a lot more  power. When you fuck with a leaders access to power your kickbacks become null and void.  It  39 s interesting seeing a liberal world leader actually calling this out. I wonder if any Democrat politicians are uneasy about this but unwilling to say anything because they absolutely must toe the line right now.  I have plenty of liberal acquaintances who vote steady  but who are unhappy with many new trends in Democratic party. They privately lament  then vote Democratic anyway.   The world is watching  which means Trump is winning  It means the people are winning.  yes  this 100 . this is a good comment and I like it a lot.  No  they want to act like the few hundred who rioted is the extent.   keep in mind Americans aren  39 t aware of the full extent of their treason yet.  OhI know  the last 3 years have shown that for a lot  it  39 s real to them  and they dont see how a presidency started by being spied on is nuts  it  39 s so much more than just spying. even Rosenstein putting a hit out on Seth Rich is just a tiny  tiny piece of the puzzle  I would honestly love to hear what you think trump stands for. God bless America and the working class around the world.   a href  https   i.imgur.com MOuTT2c.jpg  this unironically  a   I m definitely on board with this one. Satanist wealthy scum run the earth.  I  39 m glad this is getting some international attention. To be honest though  I am very much more worried about the coordinated attacks on Parler from all the leftists tech companies. They are desperate to maintain their ideological cartel on tech.  If you still have a Twitter  best thing is to get rid of it.  Remember  France despises censorship. Charlie Hebdo part one  a few years ago  and Charlie Hebdo part two  a few months ago  sparked some of the largest outrage France has seen in a while. And France frequently is largely outraged over everything.  Where is Antifa through all of this   I thought they opposed fascism   They should be protesting this forced suppression of opposing thought  right    This is the amusing and horrifying part.  As a NYer  western NY   I agree.  Yup  they cloak themselves in moral supremacy   then go use the most extreme labels for everyone else.  Wow  I can  39 t believe I  39 m agreeing with Merkel   Merkel and the president of Mexico are smart enough to know that if America falls to the Socialist  Communist rest of the world would follow.  Because Europe has dealt with fascists before and know the warning signs  and are beginning to fear the authoritarian overreaching of social media and the Democrats.  Much unlike the basement dwelling wannabe commies that pretend anyone who doesn  39 t sing the song of Marx and Engels is a fascist.  You can t put the cat back into the bag...  This is true.    Two can play that game. Ban their apps on your countries for censoring free speech. Let see how fast they bend over.  Even countries without free speech rights know this is ridiculous  Merkel better hope she doesnt have Dominion in her country or she  39 s next with this kind of crazy talk.  We don  39 t use voting machines here in Germany. Only clean paper ballots.  Do you use mail in voting  why or why not   For some context everybody who is allowed to vote here in Germany has the option to request their mail in ballots online. As soon as you do that a notification will be added to the electoral dictionary so you don  39 t get your vote counted twice.   See  there are ways this can be done right  and the point that we have an entire side of the aisle here in America denying we can improve our system because it just bagged them a victory is absolutely disgusting to me.  Well  fuck me.  She would be the one in favor of dominion. I live there.  Every foreign government right now is looking at Twitter and Facebook absolutely stunned.   If they come for me in the morning  they will come for you in the night.      Angela Davis   quot If they can do it to their own president  they can do it to us quot    quot ...Rights like the freedom of speech   39 can be interfered with  but by law and within the framework defined by the legislature    not according to a corporate decision.  39  quot   Well looks like twitter and amazon hosting etc have screwed themselves in Britain.  No company should ever host with Amazon Web Services again.  Google and Amazon have literately destroyed a company consequence free. Just wiped them out off the face of the planet essentially and people are celebrating that like its a good thing. These tech companies are literally controlling free speech and people are cheering it.  The irony of seeing the German Chancellor call out the left for threatening free speech when those same people constantly call us Nazis...it s beautiful.  Corporations having the power to silence world leaders to the extent they did Trump should concern every world leader. If they let it run rampant soon corporations will threaten silencing government officials in exchange for favorable laws. The banks will threaten to remove government officials accounts. Who knows what else they will do. This can  39 t be normalized not even under the leftist pretense of  quot their a private company quot . If we let them take an inch they  39 ll go for the mile.  Never in a billion years would I think I would agree with Angela Merkel on something  Even Merkel  What weird timeline are we in   I don  39 t agree with Angela Merkel on much  but she  39 s right and I  39 m glad that even a liberal leader in a very liberal country can stop and say that this sets a troubling precedent.
t3_kvbxa0,Twitter Shares Drop by 12 Percent After Company Banned Trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvbxa0/twitter_shares_drop_by_12_percent_after_company/,These are rookie numbers.  We need to pump these numbers up.  I had someone tell me via DM it  39 s okay that Conservative voices are being banned on Twitter because they spread lies.   You ought to see what sort of DMs that I get...  Are they death threats like mine   Every day  at least 5 death threats  They sure are. I m averaging one a day from people directly threatening me for posting rational  thought out conservative views.  Where are my death threats  Why am I being left out so ungraciously   Haha haven t had a death threat in a while  mostly just lefties telling me how much they want to hurt me or how they hope I get sexually assaulted and stuff  Those ones are the better ones...I get some pretty depraved heathens.  I don t ever get dms     Ive gotten a few. The most hilarious thing they do is award spam which cracks me up cuz that shit costs money lol.  I get a few the angry dms make my day because I know I am living rent free in their head  Stay here long enough....  Just ask  You ll get em  Took a few weeks for me but now I get several a week telling me how dumb I am in very colorful language . It s hilarious.  Mine have been calling me a  quot NAZI Snowflake quot  like what is that a frozen swastika   To be honest  I don t see why people still use Twitter.   People who love to smell their own farts go on twitter because they can virtue signal and get their balls fondled by similarly minded buffoons. Anyone happy with their life doesn  39 t need Twitter.  Kinda like how we suckle on each other  39 s balls here    Fair point. I think we are a bit more open to others ideas though  and maybe their farts too       South Park episode comes to mind      At least myspace was fun with how you could customize your page. I only have Facebook because every time I turn it off my family  39 s freaks out.  I have never seen positive news story about someones tweet.   Brings out the worst in the worst people   The fact that twitter and Facebook have become tech versions of Banana Republics is quite fascinating and damning. Not too long ago Zuckerberg was imploring that Facebook shouldn t be the arbiter of truth. But these guys are at the behest of their far left employees  the impacts of which are going to be destructive in the long run.  That  39 s what I call a good start. The reality is though  they  39 ll probably bounce back within a few weeks.  Not sure. Twitter was declining before and Trump legit saved them.  That s the grand irony in all of this. Twitter wasn t on life support necessarily  but they were very clearly on the decline and maybe the inevitable path to death before Trump. He nearly single handedly revived the platform with his presidency. Similar can be said about CNN and MSNBC too.  Those nitwits don  39 t look at it that way. All they think is  quot Orange Man quot  bad without any regard to their bottom line. I  39 d be pissed if I was a shareholder.  The shareholders are pissed. That  39 s why it  39 s dropping  haha.  Even if it didn  39 t Dorsey et al don  39 t give a fuck.  It could drop 25  and they would still think it  39 s worth it.  Maybe 50  would get them a bit upset  but I wouldn  39 t even bet on that.  Hell yeah lose another 5 billion. While you are at it take farcebook  with you.  Jack better hope Republicans never retake government  or he  39 s in for a bad time.  With Dominion we won  39 t  The platform should have been long dead.  Keep it going  These companies aren t subject to being elected or removed from office  you have to vote on them with your time and money. Every second you spend on their app is the fuel that keeps them in power.  Despite everything that has happened recently  I still initially read this as  quot after company banned tramp. quot   Kylo Ren   em MORE  MORE   em

Whilst complaining about racial equity  and the dangers of gentrification while in front of a Trader Joe s.  I told a few family members of mine that I don  39 t take people  39 s skin color into consideration when I   You re definitely not contributing to racism  Appreciating their possible cultural observations and experiences is part of the friendship  but you wouldn t find that out until you re friends  so how is that ignorant   I have no clue.  I have tried understanding their perspective before.  They also claim that you can  39 t be racist or say racist things towards white people  because  quot White people make up the majority of the population  and have more systemic power over other races. quot   Sadly ive given up on many people i grew up with. Its simple they are extremists and are no longer friends.  They are enemies of freedom and the American way of life.  My guy  with this much effort to prove you re not racist  this sounds like you have one of two things happening    The conversation started after I told them I disagreed with many things that my Democrat colleagues have been saying recently.    Ahh I missed one  Their world is full of such ironies.  Then doom troops through a whole foods.   quot Fuck Capitalism  quot   he types from his iPhone 12 pro  while munching on the bag of Doritos he purchased earlier from the local 711.   And then tweets  Twitter is a private company  They can do what they want    I m truly convinced that liberals don t actually know what they are advocating for. They just go along with what s  trendy  or what they think makes them look virtuous.  Absolutely. Watch a few of those videos with Will Witt interviewing two or more liberals. The first thing they do is look at each other to make sure they aren  39 t speaking against the party. Or with Steven Crowder  39 s Change My Mind videos. Once they are outside their echo chambers and aren  39 t being spoonfed their beliefs  their arguments fall apart.  They are now protesting against protests.  Lol  Their justification is truly stupid when you see what was said and what happened. You compare the crap that was spewed prior and after all those protests all summer and the hypocrisy is so thick it kills when it lands. They don t care. Granted  we didn t move to use government to corral big tech  and big tech is leftist. Our own principles have brought us to our knees. They re cheering on the destruction and isolation of us because they see us as problematic things. We aren t people to them.   Haha. Love the edit at the bottom.   We re gonna tax the rich  right rich guys     Pretty much the liberal  quot shop at whole foods organic non racist  section quot  of the city while complaining about Mexican gardeners  trash collector trucks  dump plumbers  dirty farmers and naive religious idiots who believe in a god.  Not to include Islam though  that  39 d be insensitive .  I love the anti religion   resistance take the left has. Because I bet they all ask mom and dad for Christmas presents every year.  I ve always struggled to link the over protectiveness surrounding Islam and the Marxist ideologies obsession which seem to follow the leftist liberal mindset.  It seems to me these are contradictions.  They think they are the resistance but really they are the death eaters.  That s what always made me laugh the whole resistance movement that was backed by celebrities  corporations and cheered on by a political party. The resistance where they could express their ideas 24 7 with no fear where they could march and burn and no authorities came down on them. That was their grand resistance lmao. No no what you are seeing is the beginning of the real resistance one where the enemy is big powerful and full of people screaming for it to use its authority with blood and vinegar  Of all the abilities and traits those on the Left lack  self awareness might be at the top of the list.

t3_kvgo90,Bill Belichick declines to accept Presidential Medal of Freedom,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvgo90/bill_belichick_declines_to_accept_presidential/,Why the fuck are the giving the Presidential Medal of Freedom to a football coach   I have no problem with it  if it is treated like the civilian version of the Congressional Medal of Honor. Basically an award given for outstanding heroism. The problem is that it is a meaningless trinket given to whoever a president feels like giving it to.   an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States  world peace  cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.   That letter seems to be a harsh rebuke of Trump without even mentioning Trump by name.  Give it to Thomas Sowell instead  Absolutely. Dudes a genius.  Here  here. Long overdue.  He should have 3 of them already  Yes.  This is the part of the letter where I stopped believing that he wrote it.  It really makes ya wanna puke  doesn  39 t it  I can  39 t find the words to describe the level of disgust this brings me.  I thought tensions were rising prior to trump  39 s tenure. The topic was beyond whoever the president was.  Probably because he doesn t own a suit  Lol funny line. BB actually wants to wear suits on the sideline. NFL forbids it  and makes them wear team apparel. Sleeveless hoodie is BB s ridiculous protest outfit. Still a funny line.  He does but the sleeves are cut out. Probably not proper WH attire.  Sad. If Biden or Obama gave me a medal of freedom I would take it in a heartbeat.   deleted   Well I don t think you have to worry about being considered bud   deleted   So brave.  Stunning and brave  I deserve it. Give it to me.  Trump should write him a Pardon for Spygate  Wow    A cheater with morals   Good for you Bill   you scumbag  You re nothing without Brady  old man.  I always wonder if he regrets letting Brady go. Apparently neither Brady nor Gronk actually liked Belichick that much.  Accurate statement right here.  Yes a thousand times.  And why would he get this medal anyway.  He made so much money from the Patriots but fails to be one.  I don  39 t care.  Well he was always a liar and cheater anyways  so I guess siding with the Social Justice people suits him.  Can t tell if this is another lib brigade or there s lots of patriots fans here  Why not both   Isn t he the director of the original spy gate anyways   Between him and  Tompa Tom  I m really pissed at myself for the Sunday s I wasted for 18 years.  Cmon  man. Every asshole at this point is too scared for their own hide to do anything that would seem unifying  This was a survival move not a political one. If accepted that medal there is a 100  chance he would be physically assaulted by his players the next time they see him  Not belichick. He s one cold motherfucker.  Ahhh wish he would have accepted it  oh well here  39 s to hopefully a better season next year lol  Makes sense considering the media is making anyone who even agrees with Trump at all on anything is an automatic far right terrorist this past week   deleted   Wow the greatest coach in NFL history is scared to accept the award because of what his players would think. Bunch of entitled cry babies getting paid to play a game for a living but lecture the public like they have it so hard  Gisele must have given him a call  He  39 s scared to death of his players. He wants to stay in the league and he  39 s too much of a punk to stand up for himself.  So brave of him.   deleted   That was four years ago though. Bill may have accepted it if last week didn  39 t happen  maybe not.  But after last week  whether you think Trump is at any fault at all  it  39 s easy to see even Bill reject this.  Maybe he didn  39 t think Trump lived up to being a leader he once thought he was.  I know  to me  he didn  39 t.  I voted twice for him but as a leader he fell way short imo  Not Bill the douche  He scared  after the kneeling crap and pandering football people ...  If this is a conservative sub and I only see flaired users commenting what s with all the down votes  Never mind I see it s the Pats fans doing the downvoting because them peeps talking trash about Bill.  It s also the lefties who have nothing better to do with their lives than brigade a sub that doesn t agree with them 24 7

I can tell you where he was   he was cheering them on.  Donating millions to them no less.  Just being the despicable person he is.  You re going to be his next target Kelley if something isn t done soon  Conservatives need to stop playing into their game and being oblivious. There s a stupid idea where everyone calls out hypocrisy thinking it ll result in things changing.  I ve never seen it work.  This dude looks like a prisoner of war. Zuckerberg looks like the douche he s always been but I feel like Dorsey is being blackmailed or tortured or something.   He  39 s Woke Rasputin.

Yeah  there might be a hand up is rear helping him with his speaking points but that  39 s no different than Biden.  At what point can they drop the facade that Twitter  39 s censorship has anything to do with   39 inciting violence  39     39 hacked materials  39   and the like   I personally hope Parler s lawsuit  or another lawsuit against Twitter  reaches the Supreme Court. Big Tech needs to be reminded by the highest court in the land that free speech is not to be infringed upon.  I was disappointed to see that Rand Paul voted with the Democrats on the 6th even though he seemed like he was saying he  39 d do otherwise leading up to that vote.

We knew this for how many years   Isn  39 t that literally always the case   Hitler  Castro  Stalin  So ... when have authoritarians ever come in cloaked in anything but moral righteousness. It s like people think Stalin came to power by telling everyone that he would oppress them  throw them in gulags  and commit numerous genocides.

Don  39 t worry they will continue to alienate more and more people.  This is true. Two of my conservative friends are married to democrats  split households if you will . Their spouses are already angered that their husbands are being depicted as terrorists for supporting trump and speaking out against election fraud. A lot of moderates   fence sitters   and even  quot light blue quot  democrats are looking at this with an eyebrow raised high.   deleted   If the Democrats  moderate  allow the extremes of the party to take control they will lose the house  senate and presidency in the next four years and they will do this  they cannot help themselves  the AOC  39 s and other extremists are going to force Nancy Pelosi out this year. When Nancy is forced out its gonna be open season for these extremists and their policies.  If you actually believe the voting isn t rigged  then they will lose control.  I think as long as we can get states to put the kabosh on large scale main in voting then there is a fighting chance. Fraud becomes even harder to do and any attempts would be more easily discovered  Except all those instances with video evidence of ballots being re scanned  altered  etc. Polling places need some serious security upgrades too  Good hopefully they realize their stupid leftist ideals are as dangerous a they where in the 30s.

Looks like foriegn policy saber rattling to me.  Liberal privilege  being able to express your political viewpoint publicly without fear of retaliation.  So what are we going to do about it   Media and big tech dictionary    We should all really stop holding Twitter to their own standards.  Exactly  it is like acting shocked that the CCP doesn  39 t actually grant any of the rights in their constitution.  Or that North Korea is not democratic.  I mean yeah tons of news outlets where excusing the violence they even used MLKs quote to do so. Not just media outlets but plenty of celebrities and politicians encouraged it as well.  Its a threat to our democracy.  If the left didn t have double standards then they wouldn t have any standards at all.  The laughable thing is that the Democrats don  39 t realise how badly they are being played. The people fomenting unrest aren  39 t for any party. They are hoping that America will disintegrate politically and corporations will take over. They already are.  I can  39 t wait to show the jack boots how peaceful I am when they come for my AR15. I  39 ll even be courteous enough to give them my ammo first.  They keep pushing as far as they  39 re allowed to go in an effort to spark a civil war. Make no mistake  there are people who can  39 t wait for it to happen and are itching to kill their political adversaries.

t3_kv2ej5,House Amazon Facebook Apple Google have monopoly power should be split,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv2ej5/house_amazon_facebook_apple_google_have_monopoly/,I  39 m glad someone said it  though there  39 s no one with the backbone to carry it through.  Apple should definitely be included with those 2.  Is apple a monopoly  I mean  they re a really good company but they re not even in control of the market share of their respective fields.  They hold a monopoly on app stores on their phones. You cannot install 3rd party apps.  Yeah  but you don  39 t have to buy their phones  Apple and Google colluded to remove Parler. That means they engaged in anticompetitive business practices  This right here. You really only have two choices android of iphone. If they work together like this that means there is no third option. Interesting enough samsung might join in the attack on google they have been having a silent wore for a while. Google wouldnt let samsung put their own apps on their own phones for a bit.  Google basic threatened to not let them use anything google if they did.  Exactly  There is not elsewhere to go to.  I  39 m not disagreeing with that  I  39 m saying it isn  39 t an argument that holds any ground to call Apple a monopoly. Because that practice is part of the reason people buy their products  for the enforced security of what you can download. A case can definitely be made for Google in my opinion  but we  39 ve already tried that in the past few months and their lawyers literally just said   quot you can use other search engines and services quot  and that was good enough apparently. So the case against Apple is not strong when it is especially easy to avoid their products entirely.  I m not saying  monopoly . Apple Google violated antitrust and tortuous interference law.   removed   This article was written 10 7 2020. The dangers it describes are made all the more clear by recent events regarding Parler. Antitrust action must be taken.  yep  Net Neutrality was a ploy so the fiber providers couldn  39 t have any leverage over the Tech Cartels    who operate in servers  software  and services.  This is what I find so funny about big tech s response. Many on the left already wanted to split them up. Even though the reasoning behind both sides are massively different  they just made the desire to split them up bipartisan supported issue.  Split them into what  A whole bunch of smaller organizations that deplatform conservatives   Won  39 t it just end up like AT amp T   Whole bunch of smaller  shittier companies that fail and get bought back up by the largest one until it  39 s a monopoly again.  If they are competing with each other that is less likely to occur  unless they collude  which is also a violation of law .  Parler should not have been able to be  quot disappeared quot .  A bunch of smaller companies who are forbidden by threat of sanction for sharing or in any way appearing to coordinate their decisions about who gets to do business in the market.  So just continue on getting conservative platforms erased   Also racketeering and conspiracy   Hard to argue otherwise. Hell  the only counterpoint I can think of is  quot well  they  39 re helping our side out by doing it so it  39 s ok quot .   Until the tech companies come for the Dems. Eventually there will be another group that will want power.  If you are able to silence the president of the US  yeah   that  39 s bit too much power.  Amazon shouldn  39 t hold server services for other online companies or government agencies.  I guarantee you this doesn  39 t happen under a blue wave.  If only the Senate was still in power of the Republicans...  Who s to say Mitch would even consider voting on it  Dude was so out of touch with what the base wants he basically single handedly torpedoed any chance of keeping the senate.  Yup we need to clean house ourselves before we have any chance against the Dems.  Nothing will be done until Big Tech starts limiting anti tech voices from the left. All of a sudden the dems will realise that big tech is not their friend.  Bring back anti trust laws  I want a trust buster in office.  Teddy Roosevelt  gt  Ronald Reagan. Fight me.  YES PLEASE  Claims of monopoly power are legally dubious but there is a clear collusion racketeering case to be made based on the way Apple  Google  and Amazon colluded to help Twitter destroy an up and coming competitor in Parler.  Isn  39 t it sad that these Big Tech companies are tone deaf   half of your market doesn  39 t share your political views so you  39 re going to shut them out  Not a real smart business practice   especially in a country founded on personal Liberty.  Ironically. The democrats will likely do this. I think big tech hoped by squashing conservatives they won t but I don t think it will work  This was warned about long ago  though I  39 m glad it  39 s finally being given the attention it deserves. If you want to utterly destroy democracy this is how you do it  consolidate all technological prowess to three left leaning tech giants.  Democrats head that committee as they were majority in the House.  Now that was in their favor and they are in office it won  39 t seem so bad to them.  I don  39 t know if that will solve the main problem  censorship. They shouldn  39 t be punished financially for allowing free speech and should be legally prevented from censoring people. For example people are not boycotting Xfinity for allowing communication that they don  39 t agree with and it doesn  39 t audit our phone calls.  These companies didn  39 t donate billions of dollars to a party that would separate them.

If Parler is a risk then the Internet police have a lot of work ahead of them if they wish to clean up the net.  They only wish to clean up the conservatives  you know   re educate  us.   strong Leftists believe free speech IS a risk to public safety.  strong   This is the pre emptive assault on free speech. Joe Biden has a whole bag of assault on free speech with our names on it  Joe Biden has made numerous comments on speech restrictions.   Parler represents a deep fear that someone other than Democrats and the elite could give a voice to a revolution. And it  39 s about the money.  What was  quot unique quot  about Parler was being unwilling to hand your data over to Google surveillance products and join ranks with Twitter  Facebook  Apple  Google  and Amazon over  quot deplatforming quot  President Donald J Trump from the Internet. All other companies with significant reach and belief in free speech were willing to sell out to the Tech Cartel due to threats or bribes.

One of their security vendors dumped them  complying with Cartel signals from Apple  Google  and Amazon  and then disclosed information publicly to expose the breach they  39 d created by suddenly dropping Parler.  This one really bothers me. Parler is  still hopefully  on it  39 s way to becoming a commonly known as used social media platform with free speech as a focus. I don  39 t mean to offend other well intended attempts but most other attempted end up only being used by fringe groups like white supremacists and neo nazis. Parler has been different. Many influential people have verified accounts there and some serious investment has been put into the site. It  39 s growth and popularity are big techs main motivations for shutting it down.  Its dead in the water now. Amazon shut them off this morning.  They are trying to rebuild the site and have it hosted elsewhere  but yeah it isn  39 t looking good atm.  Yep Parler was the only social media alternative ive ever heard someone talk about in real life  off line  Arab spring  et al  organized through social media   good  Its weird how they fixate on certain things but totally ignore others  what makes Parler more special than Gab or even 4chan  which is arguably worse  what makes the Proud Boys so special but not Identity Evropa    This crap is really getting crazy.  Nothing funny about all users of Parler being censored over a bunch of made up bs  Reported tonight that of the people arrested at the capital so far  Facebook was used to coordinate not Parler  Facebook has been used to perpetuate violence on Many occasions. Oh the hypocrisy  Source please.  This is great info.  The FBI can handle any actual organization of violence from Parler. Big tech is not wanted nor needed in this area  yet they are pretending as if they are being virtuous as they crush potential competition while they collude together.  Anything the government claims is done to protect the public is bullshit  like  quot public health quot  to justify medical tyranny.  Oh Rlllllllyy

t3_kv16dw,60 Minutes Reporter to Nancy Pelosi Lady You Obstructed a COVID Relief Bill for Eight MonthsOwn It.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv16dw/60_minutes_reporter_to_nancy_pelosi_lady_you/,I have coworkers who believe Pelosi is a hero who tried relentlessly to pass the relief bill  but the GOP blocked it at every turn.   That  39 s especially awful considering Pelosi herself admits she didn  39 t get it passed  I mean  Mitch fucked it up the last time  but for months leading up to the election Pelosi refused to put forth anything that wasn  39 t a trillion dollar mess.  Not 1 trillion but I believe it was 3.1 trillion. She went LONG on covid  And there was a lot of money that was going to bail out states with dumas governors  like California and New York.  Got a feeling the stimulus they push through on 1 21 will probably be in the  6T range  It should have been a stand alone bill not in the omnibus but Mitch did fuck everyone on it.  And never forget the first round of checks was tied to legislation mandating vote by mail.  Yeah I don t doubt Mitch is equally as corrupt and awful  but for this instance there s a difference between not wanting to provide people more relief and blocking it and intentionally letting people suffer to use for an election. That s some psychopathic shit.  She should have pulled a Harry Reid.  When he got called out on putting out the lie that Mitt Romney hadn  39 t paid taxes in 10 years  after the election he just shrugged and said   quot It worked  didn  39 t it  quot .  Same thing here.  The tactic worked and they completely got away with it.  I remember that and you have to almost admire the honesty. If anything  this shows how pathetic Mitt Romney is for cowering to those that treated him so viciously.  I can  39 t stand Obama or his presidency  but knowing Romney now I  39 m actually glad he lost...  Tbh  I think Mitch just doesn t want the work that comes with being Majority leader.  He is relatively old and has another 6 more years left in his term.  I imagine he wants to keep the benefits afforded to him by his position but doesn t want the extra work.  It s really sad b c the only group hurt by this are the American people.  The same goes for Nancy  Chuck  and all the other old school politicians currently in office.  Yeah i have friends that think trump is awful yet pelosi would be a good president and cuomo has done a great job. it  39 s sick.  Cuomo has done a great job if his goal was to murder nursing home patients and  em not  em  distribute the vaccine  while winning an Emmy.  Awomen  I think what might finally wake them up is the attacks coming on Mandalorian for luke and his toxic masculinity and cobra kai for it  39 s whiteness  perhaps when it finally hits something they care about they  39 ll realize.  No they won t. They ll convince themselves that they hated those things once it becomes cool to do so. They have no independent thought.         Even worse than sheep. More like lemmings.  They won  39 t wake up. They  39 ll be like Aunt Lydia continuing to use the cattle prod even after she  39 s been stabbed.  Well if Cuomp was president  we wouldn  39 t worry about our elderly relatives getting sick  because they would all be dead.  Pandemic solved.  Yep. Media narrative is powerful.  well it  39 s only us that sees the media as untrustworthy  the left  many of my friends  think trump has brainwashed us to not trust the media becuase he  39 s a nazi.   Bernie echoed those sentiments.  The crazy thing is that not even CNN and NBC are pushing that narrative. Wolf Blitzer even famously grilled her a few months ago over her obstructions to federal aid. She was simply there to prevent the Trump administration from accomplishing anything positive.  a href  https   m.youtube.com watch v gqPltMpWIwo  https   m.youtube.com watch v gqPltMpWIwo  a    I mean look at Cuomo. He s doing an astronomically bad job at handling covid and he s being lauded.  These people are all over reddit. It  39 s insane.  The media is going to try and pretend they  39 re playing hardball with the Dems for just a little while. They always do this  quot fight quot  after they pretended nothing was going on. See the Hunter Biden scandal. That was Russia until it was true.  I hear  quot Trump blocked covid relief all year  Trump didn  39 t want 1000 each  Hitler  quot .          I have legitimately encountered this on popular non political subs. It s so frustrating. Need we remind them that Pelosi s bill required extremely absurd stipulations such as    Not saying that the spending isn t dumb or at least worth examining  but that was just the basic spending bill to which the covid relief was attached. The real question is why the GOP was just going to pass all of that without a fight  The answer  of course  is that the legislature is totally broken and they don t vote on anything individually anymore. They each just approve each others  pet projects on the dime of the taxpayer.  Every piece of legislation should be a   39 clean bill  39 .  Any major bill the pass now is full of BS provisions and enough pork to feed the cities of Cleveland and Atlanta for a year.  I  39 m not against all of those points  but goddamn why did that shit have to be on a relief bill for the people  Speaker   Well can you blame them  How else are people supposed to get news other than the news  Once most of the countries media stops being agenda free it  39 s fucked. It  39 s no better then having state controlled media.  That s funny   Most people I know who are neutral on Pelosi don t follow politics.  Idk anyone who follows her and likes her   It  39 s because she never admits what she did  republicans will say  quot yes we held up the bill because of major amounts of wasteful spending quot  while Pelosi just says  quot nope  never held it up  not ever  I  39 ve never held it up quot  if she was truthful and would actually admit that she did and why she wouldn  39 t be speaker  Way too late to try being reporters now.  Trump is out of the way and now they will continue to dismiss people in order until big mama Kamala is left with big tech and the ccp  She refuses to own it  and the interviewer barely pushes the issue.  I mean  come on  man  Just wait til CornPop gets ahold of ya  Ya danged dog faced pony soldier   I got hairy legs.  Listen  fat. Wanna do some push ups   CornPop always makes me laugh my ass off  After Jan 20 let see who will become the new villain.  I don  39 t think they can afford to find a new villain. It  39 s gonna be Trump  that  39 s why they  39 re trying to goad him so much right now.   Look at what they did to Sandmann and how much they were worked into frenzy over him. They still despise that that kid to this day. They have no trouble creating villains.  It will still be Trump just like everything was still Bush  39 s fault during Obama  39 s run.  Man  the way they  seamlessly transitioned from running themselves ragged talking shit about Bush  to absolutely kissing Obama  39 s ass is one of the first big things that made me stop trusting the news media. I know Dubya said some goofy shit  but it was blatantly unprofessional and really made me see who owns them.  Most of the early flak seems to be headed in McConnell  39 s direction.  Nah it s Cruz first  Oh they  39 ll be caught up on Trump for a while  Republicans in Congress will get to duck the media machine for a little while longer.  Us.  quot Domestic terrorists quot  who have a different tax policy than the Democrats.  Not a lot of follow up from Leslie Stahl there. Softball the question in and let Pelosi hit all her  quot it was the Republicans fault quot  talking points.  Really sick of that fucking gasbag of a woman  I don  39 t care if you are left  right  up  down  black  white or purple  a  D    R    L    G  or  I ... We all need to agree in this nation that senators and representatives seriously need term limits.  And age limits. With how fast technology changes and the world changes  you can t have people at 80 years old who can hardly operate a simple iPhone running the country  I think setting term limits would help to solve that problem too though  because the only way you get to be that goddamned old in politics is by having a death grip onto your seat for decades and decades. I don  39 t think you see too many 70 year old 1st term congressmen and senators.   Biden is going in a year older than Trump is leaving. And Biden says he wants 2 terms  what he wants and what he gets will likely be different  but the man is saying he still wants to be president at 86 years old. 86.   And the fact that she  39 s lasted so long in Washington says a lot.  No one like her  or Maxine Waters  should be a politician or have the powers they have. They  39 re horrible people.  Only reason she is still in office is because  R  doesn t exist in California   R  exists in California  but sure as fuck not in Nancy Pelosi  39 s congressional district.  There are millions of Republicans in California  but cities like LA and San Francisco have such a stranglehold on the state that it s rare for a Republican to ever be elected to a state office.  Im doing my part   Too little too late for objectivity and honesty with the media. They shown their bias when they kept bashing Trump...  I have to admit I am impressed with just how far Nancy Pelosi is willing to take her bullshit.  I have seen five and six year olds that can spin a lie for hours and hours and even they eventually come back around  but Nancy is on another level of lying.  It  39 s easy to lie when you never get called out  It  39 s starting to make sense why they keep focusing on Trump  even with a freaking week left. They need that irrational hatred to take the focus off of themselves.  Lol no way. They  39 ll push the  quot well Trump created this mess. We will need time to fix it. quot  BS narrative.  They both accumulated the power they had have through media.  It  39 s a truly powerful weapon.  Fascism  a political philosophy  movement  or regime  such as that of the Fascisti  that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader  severe economic and social regimentation  and forcible suppression of opposition.  Nancy Pelosi is an elder lich.  I watched the beginning of the 60 Minutes interview last night  and while I vehemently disagree with the violence at the Capital  she made it sound so harrowing  yet the worst she could point out was a broken mirror and selfies with shoes on her desk.    She was probably briefed that we are going to have to ask you a tough question but it will be mostly how bad Trump is.   IT WAS THE REPUBLICANS FAAAAAAAAULT    Nice to see this from 60 minutes.  It was real satisfying. Wish it happened more frequently  funny how they weren  39 t willing to call her out on that BEFORE the  election.  Don t worry Nancy. This will die in darkness and your faithful followers will tune out the inconvenient truths revealed in this interview.  How long before that reporter  quot retires quot    The reporter is playing the role of controlled opposition. She  39 ll ask the question as  quot proof quot  of her impartiality  then spend the rest of her time subtly pushing people toward corrupt politicians.  The fact that it isn  39 t common knowledge that The democrats did this speaks to how much of a grasp the media has on us. There were multiple days when Republicans showed a complete willingness to compromise  trump offered multiple times to sign any stimulus package that was passed  literally the Republicans only standard was that it wasn  39 t 5000 pages long and filled with foreign aid. Passed that we were willing to put up with however much they wanted  we even let them bail out they  39 re own states if it meant actually getting something passed.  Friend of mine is a direct relative of Pelosi  1  I watched most of the interview and it  39 s just a bunch of pearl clutching about  quot terrorism quot  but only because it  39 s against them.  They also say  quot American democracy is under siege quot    by wanting votes counted properly  democracy is under siege.  These two hags are insane if you watch it  I don  39 t understand why either side held it up.  If they couldn  39 t agree on a bunch of the details they should have passed a one line bill and then argued for 8 months over everything else in a seperate bill.   quot  1200 to every Adult American quot .  She won  39 t...and she won  39 t have to either.  The gaslighting from this one is intolerable.  So now that the presidential race is no longer in dispute  the far Left media can pretend like they  39 re objective again. Not buying it  buddy   So thats another reporter giving up there twitter account  The house wrote  passed  and handed over a covid relief bill to the senate.   Journalism died about 4 years ago.  That was a softball question teed up so Pelosi could have the opportunity to spout nonsense about how it was all the Republicans  fault. She wasn t really being called out for anything.  I  39 m suprised she just didn  39 t quote Harry Reid  since she  39 s apparently bulletproof politically with her  5 media armor of gaslighting  So air this after the Georgia Senate run off and everyone blames the Republicans  I see.  This woman has the gall to suggest Trump staged a coup when she tried to get the pentagon to stop following Trump s orders over the weekend.  She seemed nervous during this interview what a old hag   It was watching an actual reporter talk to a child.  This is what I want to see more of in the coming years. I want to see all politicians held to the same standards. The fact that Pelosi and Schumer have the gall to act like good guys here is maddening. The people who went to the rally rioted were sick of being made to feel lesser by these elites.  About fucking time these  quot reporters quot  actually did their jobs  I think Pelosi should be impeached.  She has gone crazy.  She tried to force Pence into invoking the 25th Amendment.  There are 9 days until Trump leaves office and she pulls BS like that   That is insane.  Her  tell    look away   increased blinking.  And despite this her party got  quot elected quot . They can do pretty much anything they want because the media covers them at every corner. But a Rep ties a single windsor on his tie instead of a double  IMPEACH   Did they eventually talk about her breaking lockdown rules in her own state 
t3_kuz3pk,Twitter drops over 8 premarket after Trump ban,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuz3pk/twitter_drops_over_8_premarket_after_trump_ban/,Keep uninstalling lads  Done two days ago.   quot Sorry to see you go.  GoodBye quot   That  39 s a great hastag.  Been gone since they began censoring free speech. Can t even address concerns without being told you re wrong.  Why were you even using the Twitter before then   I was never on Twitter to begin with but would occasionally click links to  quot news quot  posted on Twitter  whose format is awful and makes it difficult to follow what is going on . I no longer click anything linking to Twitter.  I mainly used it to see what the President was tweeting but uninstalled it this weekend when he got banned suspended or whatever  I didn t. I hardly used myself but read sometimes. And many links was to Twitter. I was also working with social media but mostly with videos.  I can  39 t believe any one permitted that trash on their phone anyway.  So...slight problem. I don t remember my password for Twitter  lol.  I m going to have to reset my password just to deactivate my account.  Shouldn  39 t be a problem at all.  It  39 s worth it. Do it.vthis needs to hurt them. Bad  I doubt deleting my unused account will do any damage. Like using a pistol against Galactus.  It has more potential damage than doing nothing.  It depends how they count users. The bigger the hit in deactivated accounts the better for everyone. One of the only tools we have at the moment is things like this. It has to hurt them or else they will see it as a sign that most of the country is fine with it and that censorship is ok.  11.5  now  don  39 t just uninstall  be sure to deactive your account.  Just did both  Fuck Twitter     I hope there  39 s a mass exodus of people from Twitter and that it  39 s primarily people who work and actually afford things  such that advertisers see how little gain there is on their platform     I made my account in the spring of 2009.  Permanently deleted last night.  My account was made some many years ago. I barely used it.... I deactivated it as soon as I heard about the ban.  The real question is why did anyone have Twitter beforehand   To follow President Trump           He  39 ll just take the company private buying back the low priced shares. Jack doesn  39 t work for the shareholders. He doesn  39 t work for the users. He works for the people that buy your user data and pay him to control what is and isn  39 t promoted   like the Chinese Communist Party.  To get news faster from independent journalists and keep up with creators in hobbies i enjoy. Its not all politics.  I never got Twitter.  I thought about getting it but I spend to much time on my phone as it is.  That and now I  39 m learning more about who runs that platform and I  39 m not impressed to say the least.  I do like to follow Elon and Snowden though. How else can you follow them  Suggestions   Years ago I was able to view Twitter on the web without the app.  Just can  39 t like or comment.  Hmmm. Wonder if I can set up alerts for that too. Good idea. Thanks   Be sure to use Ublock origin extension so they don t get any ad money  Okay I ll have to research that    I straight up deleted my decade old account.   Make sure to 1 star review first  Haha just looked under most recent reviews. It has a shit ton of 1 star reviews  Done   Just deactivated my 11 yr old account and uninstalled    Actually dont forget to deactivate your accounts before you leave  Hasn  39 t been installed in more than four years. The same as Facebook.  Do they even know care if it  39 s installed   Twitter seems to care more about politics than business.  The CEO and billionaires at Twitter do I  39 m sure. But if I was a working man stock holder and I just saw 8  of my investment go poof to elect a man who wants to raise capital gains tax from 21  to 40 .... I  39 d be furious.  You don  39 t have to pay capital gains tax if you don  39 t make any capital gains  em taps head  em   Ha  Brilliant  Modern problem  meet modern solution.  I think the board members have opened themselves up to a lawsuit for not acting in the shareholders best interests.  It certainly appears they  39 ve ignored their fiduciary responsibility.  The defense they ll use is the same one they ll use to go after all of us  danger.  There  39 s still fiduciary responsibility. They can preach danger all they want  but stockholders only care about profits. Last time I checked being  quot woke quot  doesn  39 t provide profits...but quite the opposite.  Would keeping Trump s account up be seen as best interests  I m wondering if the cancel culture mob cancelling Twitter if they didn t suspend Trump would have been more damaging. This is why every social network except Twitter banned Alex Jones  and then there was an awkward spotlight on them so they shrugged it off saying how he didn t do anything wrong but then magically made up a reason to ban him just days afterwards. This is why I don t think these social media companies are in direct communication  but they just see in which direction the winds are blowing. In other words if you re at Twitter and you see Facebook and Google YouTube deplatforming someone then you follow suit.  They admitted at the Senate hearings after Cruz  amp  CO got the name of the apps  big tech shares information  coordinate banning over all platforms  etc. Cruz actually pulled out screenshots of the inter company info sharing apps.          Big brotherland  We  39 ve gone way beyond just big brother government now. Imagine if this was happening 20 years ago when the patriot act was being discussed.           link  I am curious  Youtube the Social media Senate hearings from like 2 months ago I think  Dorsey especially got grilled by Cruz who must have an inside whistleblower. PS dorsi is a snake and got caught in several lies.  Dorsey looks like a was recruited by ISIS recently. Of course he  39 s a snake. He  39 s a product of our government  ironically  just like ISIS.  I  39 d never seen him before  I thought it was a joke when this guy looking strikingly like the homeless guy who lives in a tent behind the gas station ended up being the Twitter CEO.  Part of Twitter  39 s valuation comes from active daily users and amount of daily activity.  Trump generated massive amounts of activity for Twitter. With him completely gone  that activity goes away.  Do you know about the proposed stockholder to stakeholder conversion  Globalists say valuations based on profits encourages companies not to do the right thing for society. It s complicated  but they want companies to be valued on how much  good  they do. This is a prime example.  Unless they share their politics or are pressured to share their politics.  Fingers crossed we  39 re both wrong.  They don  39 t care about money  it is the ideology that matters.  Lol you honestly think twitter cares more about ideology than their bottom line   Jack and the moderators of Twitter   Yes.  Yes Twitter is one of the least viable publishers out there for ad revenue.  It really is. Twitter ads are the worst of anything in social media. I have done digital and social for many years now and anyone who tells me that they spend ad money on Twitter I know immediately is an idiot.  Twitter was a semi dying platform  then Trump starter ranting on it and it got revived. Supposedly 40 50  of it  39 s active users had some amount of Trump interaction. We need to remember that these social media platforms have not stood the test of time  people are very fluid and will move to the next  quot hip quot  thing in an instant.  Dorsey is either getting racks from China or hoping he could become part of the dictatorship if they succeed to accomplish one  This. 90  of Twitter is a small week project by a competent full stack web programmer. They are replaceable. Like the NYT only path forward is as state sponsored or billionaire sponsored approved media and they know it  I remember pre Trump there was widespread talk about how Twitter was going to die because it had burned all the investor money and could not for the life of them show a profit.  Then Trump got in and made it his platform  which spiked traffic.  Yep. They killed their golden goose... Anyone notice how leftists don  39 t seem to have paid attention to their fairy tales  Crying wolf is a daily occurrence.  They are banking on being the only govt approved platform after the coup is complete.  Seems they are well on their way to that goal.  Apparently Twitter wants to stop being a private business and become a government propaganda distribution agency  I mean authority over the narrative is definitely worth something.  Their business is selling the mined data of the non customers  Twitter Users  and messaging control  boosting  deboosting  curated trending  shadowbans  and blacklists  to their real customers  Chinese Communist Party  global multi national corporations  politicians  etc. .  That s still not even close to its 2015 2016 lows. Would need to lose closer to 50  to get into that territory.  Give it some time.  Turn this into another Gillette  they had to lose  8 billion after stupidly claiming there was an issue with masculinity and it was toxic. Which was false  masculinity isn  39 t toxic  those scumbags were trying to belittle and criticize men who made up a majority of their user base.  As long as another brand is available I refuse to buy Gillette.  Switch to the more refined safety razors. There are so many great blades to try  and there  39 s one for every face. I made the switch a while back and never looked back.  0.10  0.30 per razor  nicer shave and the blade doesn  39 t get clogged up every stroke. Even my wife switched to using one.  I bought one of the old style 2 sided safety razors with replaceable 2 sided blades. The replacement blades only cost about  20 for a pack of 100. I only shave twice a week and each blade is good for several shaves so after 4 years I  39 m not even halfway through my  20 pack of blades lol  Gentleman  get civilized. Buy a real straight razor and a piece of leather for stropping it with.             I did the same thing   Don  39 t bother will Dollar Shave Club  they  39 ve donated quite a bit of cash to the terrorist groups BLM  amp  Antifa.  Also their blades are trash.  I  39 ve been using Schick  great product and not expensive.  Did they fire anybody over this   No but the CEO resigned and they took an  8 billion write down.  CEO  quot resigned quot   I didn  39 t see anyone else taking a personal hit from what I read...  That  39 s cool  the CEO had to have signed it off.   Down 11  at 9 33 am EST   Yea  but I hate these posts.  More please  Hopefully it keeps on tumbling down.  And it  39 s not all tech.  QQQ moving in the complete opposite direction the last 5 days.  Yeah there  39 s no way to argue this isn  39 t because of banning Trump.  It  39 s won  39 t  it  39 s already gained 2  back.  Big tech didnt even wait for Trump to be out of office to go full ussr censorship of conservatives.  Not enough.  It s amazing.   Puts on Twitter   easy tendies  IV is already too high  Disabled my account over the weekend.  Don  39 t miss it  didn  39 t really use it anyway.  not enough  hopefully 80  by the end of the week  We know it realistically won  39 t go that low. Especially this week.  This is just the start.  The Biden administration will administer the coup de grace.  It is still doing much better than DJIA after pre covid times. Let  39 s hope it plunges 50  more one hour twenty minutes  This is how you kill social media. You LEAVE  Who knew that when you alienate a huge part of the population your business suffers..  Honestly  I wouldn  39 t say they  39 re really suffering. It  39 s just another average red day in the market.  Don  39 t watch twitters stock today. Waitfor their next earnings report.  They can hide the damage into then  DEACTIVATE YOUR TWITTER BEFORE YOU UNINSTALL IT PLS    And let Twitter know your reason why  Down 12  now.  This isn  39 t really a big deal it will be normal again in like 2 weeks  Twitter has confused their purpose. As a company they  39 re there to make money  not to be SJW.  It s not like conservative voices can go elsewhere right now  Along with Twitter  Apple  Amazon  and Google stock should also be sold. There could be anti trust issues as they conspired against a competitor.  They have committed suicide by their un american caving to these power hungry leftists  The entire market is down. This is probably correlation not equalling causation.  Yeah every stock is trending down today.  Breach of fiduciary duty to the shareholders  they should take action.  Dack Jorsey needs to learn......  Always baffling to see a company who s struggled to pull their finances into the green absolutely tank their own share price while every other tech company is booming financially.  You absolutely love to see it  10ish  during trading   not enough for anyone over there to panic  and it will probably level out in a week or so.  10  of Twitter  39 s value is 2 billion dollars. Not time for them to shit the bed yet  but you can bet they are noticing.  Agreed   they better take notice  but for those of us who were hoping jack was going to get stomped today   it didn  39 t happen.  12  now  Deactivated today. Hope this company implodes.   deleted   I know one the most famous yesterday deleted all her photos  That s it  I would have expected much more.  12  now  Couldn t have happened to a nicer company.  Lol  their entire boom in value was because the literal most powerful person on the planet did 90  of his public communication through them. No one is going to be waiting on fucking Biden or Kamala  39 s every thought. Them banning him is just going to push more people off.  A major company like twitter doesn  39 t lose  2.5 billion in a week by accident. They are being compensated for this from somewhere else. My guess is they  39 re taking the short term hit in exchange for promises from democrats to protect them from anti trust suits.  Facebook is also down 2   Not only are Trump supporters in the US uninstalling. It s also people all around the world. Trump supporters aren t exclusive to the US  I find it funny when this sub tries to use short term stock prices to justify what ever political issue aligns with the conservative view point. If you look at twitters stock it was at the highest it s been since it s IPO. It was already trending slightly down but still higher than it was a month ago and will probably rise again shortly.  Dicks is dead  and twitter will be dead too.  If you got money in Twitter  sell now   I  39 m gonna be honest  that  39 s terrible stock advice. The news is already out and the drop was negligible at best. Unless more  quot news quot  comes out that may be damning toward the platform  it  39 s not going to bleed dry. It may go down a little bit over the next few days  but it  39 ll be back to where it was by next week or the week after.  It  39 s on us  now. The Dems are never going to hold big tech accountable while big tech is helping and covering for them.  What  39 s Twitter  Never bought one...  I  39 m seeing so many unflaired comment notifications of people thinking we  39 re whining about Trump being banned. This isn  39 t about him entirely. It  39 s a slippery slope of mass censorship and so many couldn  39 t care less about it. It happens to conservatives and people don  39 t care. It happens to some random social justice warrior and all of a sudden everyone comes to their defense. If all you see is Trump and not the big picture in all of this  then you  39 re sorely misguided.  Dump Twitter now  Leave it to all the whiny li  39 l bitches who want war with anyone who isn  39 t a limp wristed libbie. Leave an empty chamber for them to scream and lie on.  I know Apple brand loyalists who are ditching them because of the parler thing.  delete delete delete   Uninstall but buy the stock at discount then sell for massive gains lol  No. Fucking. Shit.  Maybe their stockholders will organize a peaceful protest.  They can coordinate the event on Facebook.   a href  https   ibb.co HgH0KQq  rel  nofollow   GoodBye  a    quot You love to see it. quot   Not surprising at all  just think back to 2016. Twitter was a dying platform and all of the kiddos were like  quot wHo eVeN UsEs TwITtEr quot  when Trump really started platforming on it.  Is going to go down more today likely

Many people make the mistake of identifying him as a Turtle when  in fact  he is a Tortoise. It s a common mistake among amateurs.  The tortoise comparison is fair and accurate. But I do picture his tongue to come out like a Komodo Dragon.  He is clearly on land more than in water... Pretty concrete evidence for a tortoise.  Slow and lumbering.  Satanic. Just like Graham  Pelosi  Schumer. Fucking creepy mother fuckers.  He s a swamp creature.  I think him and Graham belong to the sodomite species.  Any rally that isn t for the left will be considered this way.  We have lost folks  in more ways than the election.  They re coming for us.  We re already at the point where standing for the national anthem is considered a racist act.  Soon even flying a flag in your front yard will be offensive to some people.  Are there any Americans that actually want this shit   You ve gotta realize what the people pulling the strings want is absolutely independent from what the general population wants. Sure  there s some overlap  but there s a reason that when the people demand a basic thing like COVID relief  that it gets turned into a massive bill with a bunch of unrelated bullshit buried in it. That unrelated bullshit is what they want. The part you voted for  That s a Trojan horse. Every time. Both parties. At this point  I m convinced that Pelosi raises her wine glass  McConnell rails a line of coke  and they congratulate each other on how easily they re able to manipulate the American people into getting them rich at the taxpayer s expense.  This is something I don t get...they re 80 years old  very wealthy  and hold a lot of power. Why does more money even matter to them at this point in their lives   Evil  The love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. Not surprising.  Bravo. One word says it all. They won  39 t win though. Some of us believe in a higher power who will smite the evil doers.  Well  eventually. Theres no guarantees about our country tho  I don  39 t believe God delivers justice on earth. A hundred billion souls have died while praying to survive  why should ours be any different  Our reward is life after death  nothing else.  Most chinese didnt want to be part of a communist dictatorship either  I actually had this conversation yesterday. I don t know any democrat friends or family that want any of what you mentioned.  We are the minority. There are 100 150 million of us at max  At this point it won t matter. Once a Democratic House hands off an amnesty bill to a Democratic Senate to be signed by a Democratic President it will add 30 million Democratic voters to the rolls. The Republicans will never hold power ever again. The influx of Latino voters will more than likely vote for what they know. The socialist will have this country. This is set in motion  the fat lady is singing. By the time Biden is forced out and President Harris is sworn in the Democrats will be rolling joints with the Declaration of Independence and using the Constitution to light the bonfire we are all burned on.  And for the last 40 years  we have been importing new  quot Americans quot  from places with no history  experience  or culture of freedom or representational govt. then telling them in school that the US is the worst  most racist country ever.  Our future appears more and more like Ilhan Omar  and she has no issue with putting boot to neck.  Yes  dude  there are. I don  39 t know them and you don  39 t know them  but they  39 re the people that get amplified because they beg for more authoritarianism. The media and the government can  39 t wait to give it to them.

Soon  We are already there   Someone got a flagged removed from a private business that was flying on their property because you could see it from the highway and someone felt it was aggressive.  I think people who are optimistic live in places unlike mine.  The one think is already here.  As a Canadian  this defeatist attitude is troubling to me. Americans have been known to take on much harder tasks than the current one before them. Where is the spirit that defeated the British against overwhelming odds  Where is the strength that defeated the democrat slavers during the civil war  How about that National Socialists  WW2 would have been lost without the Americans. There are things that can be done to fight this. For instance  truckers can refuse to deliver Amazon products until they stop playing politics. I don  39 t know if it would work  but it can be tried.    removed   God bless TX.    removed   Oh great here  39 s some tactical advice  gtfo off reddit talking like this.  The reason I am basically at a political low point is because I think the gameplan is as follows   And this is why I  39 m not freaking out. There is some seriously bad stuff going on. And this freaking stupid education system which has removed civics and ceases to teach people about our laws  nation  and founding have made a deluge of weak ass soyboys who are afraid to fight and hide behind masks all of the time.  Idk. Honestly a lot of this could be solved if corporations were not allowed to make political contributions in the first place. It is now news worthy that  quot X company stopped Y contributions to K candidate quot    so then people bandwagon on it and demand Z company do the same or they stop buying their products  giving much more leverage to the dollar for the opinions it can sway by chaining influence via economic pressure.   We will. Some of the people on Reddit are very young. They need to become engaged in local politics. This is where it starts. Please take heed. If you don  39 t agree with the stripping of your Constitutional rights  get off of Reddit today and call   your local Republican party. It starts here. President Trump is going to stay involved.  I ve been told  by friends of many years  that I need to be reprogrammed.  That I m not a bad person I just don t realize how my thoughts are troublesome.  I also am the wage earner for my family.  As those at the capitol protests outside and the riots inside will tell you  they have been doxxed and fired.  Having an alternate opinion is no longer allowed.  Only   Doesn  39 t matter  evil never wins. We  39 re not going anywhere.  It  39 s important to discern the thousands of peaceful protestors at the rally from the few rioters that acted independently from the protest.  Funny thing about MAGA rallies  they decried window smashers as  quot Antifa quot  and wrestled them away multiple times. A cop was assaulted by a couple of armed yahoos  why are so many in Bicycle Helmets  btw   at the front trying to breach the doors and protestors came up from behind and dragged the assaulters off the cop to the cheers of the protesting crowd.  Peaceful assemblies as domestic terrorism   Well yeah  you have to destroy innocent people  39 s businesses  homes  and lives that have absolutely nothing to do with what you  39 re protesting to be peaceful.  The hypocrisy is laughable.  It s amazing how far Dems overstepped  their 50 50 Senate mandate.  The left now cares about cops and property though. Rules for thee...  Those fucks took MLKs words and bastardized them into thinking violence is the way to attain social change.  Even Malcom X was against this shit by the end of his life.  Yes  How can it be peace if you are not supporting the approved opinions and repeating the required slogans   You will be deplatformed as a human shortly  Become an unperson is the language in the newspeak dictionary volume 4 that you should be using comrade. If other people hear you use out dated language not approved by the party it will be very doubleplusungood for you.  Delete. Any. And. All. Social. Media. Now. If. You. Haven  39 t. Already.    A couple months ago  they were 110  against labeling anyone a terrorist. BLM Inc and antifa could take over cities blocks and burn down buildings and they were  just an ideology .  Just trade the red hats for blm gear.  All opposition is terrorism. Wear a mask and collect your  2000 government check without objection. Work and business are now forbidden because of the Invisible Enemy   Is that sarcasm I  39 m detecting  Don  39 t think I wont report this to the Wrong Think Internet Police  sup TM  sup   they are rallying so hard against Trump it convinces me more and more he was the right guy for the job.  I  39 d like to see what the result would be if they did a National referendum on Congressional term limits.  gatherings of our political opponents will now be classified as Domestic Terrorist Activities... How dare anyone think to oppose our RULE    Democrat double standards at work  they can  39 t stand to hear out the other side and have a difference in opinions. They also never condemned the burning and rioting of cities months ago...  They are afraid.  Just bring something big to burn to every rally and you ve got yourself a peaceful blm protest instead  Democrats have done more damage to civil rights in a week than Trump did in 4 years...yet somehow he is literally Hitler.  What I like to ask ppl ranting about Trump so much is   And most Americans will be too blind to see  No  more like too stupid to know what s going on. Why do you think the US educational system is so fucked  It s easier to take everything from people that are too dumb to see it going.  Homeschooling is the way now. Don  39 t let your children be subjected to radical thinking.  My grandchildren will not go to traditional brick and mortar school. Most people on the Right have made this decision already.  So antifa isn t considered domestic terrorism   i have read many books and short stories like this. It usually does not end well     removed   Then step the fuck up and lead from the front  be the change you want to see in the world.  Thank you  That s what I ve been arguing for. Firm but peaceful.  I completely agree with you. You can  39 t lead from the back.  If true  this is peak hypocrisy.  We  39 re beyond hypocrisy  this is just straight up tyranny.  MAGA is an idea  They are afraid of something... and its not a few windows breaking and security guards shooting a woman in the neck.  Ok  so what are the feckless republicans in congress going to do about it   So  when will  em any  em  right leaning rally be classified as domestic terrorism  Trump will be gone in a few days.  Will any candidate with  R  after their name be vilified   Yes.  The war has already started and not with bullets and guns but with bans and censorship. We need to to figure out how we fight back.  I  39 ve been saying it for awhile  This is a new cold war.  The Cold War never ended. This  em IS  em  the Cold War.  If they let this happen  that means  quot John Smith quot  who runs as a Republican for President long after Donald Trump is gone will also face his campaigns being labeled as domestic terrorist activity. That  39 s the precedent they  39 re setting  that any opposition to the Democrat party is bad.  Damn  they  39 re against freedom of speech  we  39 ve known that for years now.  DoJ has   25 cases of domestic terrorism already open   a href  https   www.foxnews.com us 25 domestic terrorism cases capitol riot  https   www.foxnews.com us 25 domestic terrorism cases capitol riot  a    Why are they fascists   And this is why every gun law is an infringement...  Going to wait to see the evidence for this one.  so will they classify BLM rallies as domestic terrorist activity since those were objectively worse in terms of violence destruction deaths  oh right  those domestic terrorists support democrats.  It just keeps looking more and more like the reichstag fire  This won t get past committee. It s blatantly unconstitutional  as if the constitution matters to them   Is that photo on the left real  Gross  I m moving to Mexico.  After the fact  lol  Pelosi doesn t look a day older than 107.  Letting their true colors shine  Commie Red  Democrats do not believe in the Constitution and thus will work to erode Freedom of Speech  ie the First Amendment . It  39 s part of why they want to step on the Second Amendment  to make it easier to erase the rest.  How bout the fucktards that are still out there burning down Portland  Is that domestic terrorism   No. The fires being set in Portland are just an idea and a mostly peaceful one at that.  This is a first amendment violation  This isn  39 t a Republic in trouble. This is a Republic in its death throes.  So everybody that opposes this needs to start showing up to and holding MAGA rallies.  We  39 re Americans  it  39 s time we start acting like it.

They understand. They are lying to get power.  Totalitarian government in the making.  If Democrats didn t have double standards  they d have no standards at all.  The world began in 2016  how is this possible   I thought it ended in 2012   I thought we all died of covid.  I  39 m starting to wish it did.  But it s different when they do it   Hip Hop Chrissy  Literally every time they lost  The left have been coddled their whole lives  either by the government with welfare and other social programs  or by society with participation trophies and banning F grades from school. They are spoiled little children in adult bodies. They cry  quot me me me quot  and throw tantrums when they do not get their way  then their behavior is reinforced by professors and politicians who tell them they are precious and special and it  39 s really the straight white man  39 s fault things are bad.  This is the absolute truth from these entitled privileged Marxist s.  Objections to certification should be seen as the right of every federal legislator. This may lead to silly objections  but that is better than the alternative.  But now it is the impeachable offense of inciting insurrection.  You know why the left is like this today  its because there is no Robert Byrd to keep them in line  and all of you love circle jerking Hannity  39 s idiotic and irrational hatred of the man  Strom Thurmond and Robert Byrd were protecting this country from the Leftist Communists like AOC  Pelosi and co  this is why it took them so long  so while the rest of you keep hating on the man who tried to ban the murder of children via abortions  the Left will continue to march on in their war on our freedom.
t3_kvak0l,Ron Paul Banned from Facebook,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvak0l/ron_paul_banned_from_facebook/,Ron Paul is one of the last people I figured would ever get a ban from anything  honestly.  The GOP establishment hated him  they woud have banned him from being on the ballot during the primaries if they could. Despite no longer identifying as a libertarian or even a Ron Paul conservative I will never speak ill of him  he  39 s the epitome of principles and standing up for what you believe in. Screw anyone that trashes him or supports bans like this. He  39 s a better man than I could ever be.  Completely agree. Well stated. Make sure you edit the  ill of him  part   I would rather you not speak  I ll of him   He is adamantly pro freedom. That is dangerous to Democrats.  Yeah. Everyone knows Ron Paul is a violent terrorist.  sup  s  sup   Honestly  if they banned all conservatives at once that would be better than the slow drip we have been seeing.    They would lose a ton of money. So their convictions are only limited by their wallet.  He didn  39 t even do anything. Lol. So glad I got off facebook years ago  Me too...so toxic.  Twitter wasn  39 t too long after that and now that I see what Google Amazon and Apple are doing I  39 m going to look for an alternative to them too.  I rarely used twitter except to publicly communicate with large companies you would otherwise have no voice against.  But I deactivated my account last week and removed the app.  Switched yesterday.  It works great and seems a lot faster than Firefox.  I was looking at Gab yesterday. They have their own phone OS as well.  Thanks  I  39 ll check it out.  I was banned just before Christmas for seven days while the leftist I was arguing with got nothing. I said I was done and scheduled my over a decade old account for deletion within the next month and I haven  39 t looked back since.  Silencing the voice of people you don t agree with.....hmmmmm the actions of communists  Fascist...  It  39 s both really. So who  39 s getting killed with an ice pick in Cuba   lol they banned Ron Paul     em sad Ludwig von Mises noises  em   I m so happy there are two of us ...  Make it three  USA becoming China 2.0  Damnit if there s gonna be a most repressive regime in the world  it s gonna be us because we re the god damn UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. We do it right.  Texit time. It s the only way.  It s just Alex Jones  it s just Trump  it s just Paul.  Yup  a conspiracy theorist is worth 1000 Democrat politicians.  Lol if they ban Ron paul of all people  then no politician or public figure is safe.  And your everyday use sure as shit isn  39 t safe to begin with  The masks are coming off  now that the whole government is controlled by their party.  Yep they don  39 t need to appease their moderates any more  at least until 2022.  They used their mask as our muzzle  As soon as it has become clear that Trump will not be President after January 20th  big tech has gone full Nazi on banning all speech that they disagree with.  This is so upsetting.  I ve never been a big fan of his  but this is ridiculous. He is like the least ban worthy person.  Every time I see Ron Paul these days I  39 m surprised at how healthy and spry he seems. The dude seemed old way back in 2012 and he seems old now too but somehow more exuberant.  Probably much healthier after he left the swamp.  1984  I saw somewhere today that the hashtag  1984 was banned on either Twitter or Facebook  don t remember which. Oh the irony  They are one in the same. What one does the other will follow.  They go after Paul   they go after me. Fuck. This.  Just so you know  they aren  39 t going to stop.  They  39 ll simply abandon the pretext.  Now that  39 s just cruel.  Ron Paul  39 s been fighting for our rights since as long as I can remember. I hope we really get to see ornery unchained Ron Paul now  Ornery Ron Paul could be interesting. Angry Ron Paul seems terrifying some how.  Rand about to have some flashbacks to the first time he was busted smoking pot  Remember when Facebook made all the teenagers colour their profile photo in support of  quot gay marriage quot    and now we have  quot gay marriage quot    Nobody under 30 uses Facebook. They use instaSnatch and Twatter. Everyone under 30 makes fun of Facebook users  typically referring to anyone on Facebook as a Boomer. At least this is what I ve been told by all of my employees. And you d be surprised at how many late teens early twenties think the progressives are really weird. There s a reckoning coming for the left. They re just too blind to see it.  The generational numbers are actually really interesting. Apparently Gen Z is starting to look like the political antithesis of millennials in that they don t buy the SJ stuff and find a lot of socialist stuff questionable.

After defecting  he tried to warn us.  Unfortunately  most Americans didn  39 t pay attention and are already indoctrinated.  I  39 m afraid that it might be too late for the US  but we must keep up the good fight.  I mean...damn if that s not the most accurate thing I ve ever seen. And that s from an interview roughly 35 years ago.  You tell people communists are conducting a take over through information manipulation  thought control  and widespread propaganda  they will mostly look at you like you are insane. Yet it  39 s completely real.         Those who need to hear this most will deny and dismiss  You know just because people think you are crazy doesn  39 t mean you are.  In a mad world only the mad are sane.  If you haven t seen this video  it is a must watch.  I m shocked this video isn t banned yet.  Yea he is bone chillingly accurate  Spot on  Jesus F Christ. No words.....  I have returned to his word many times this year. The precience this man had is absolutely incredible.   Funny enough  Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War made many folks interested.

It wouldn  39 t be easy  but perhaps hurdling over the dem swamp is the best course of action.  And black box voting machines. Some of the lefty senators have been against them for years.  I nearly voted in the Democratic primary so I could vote for Warren because of this exact issue.   em  quot Every vendor from text message services to e mail providers to our lawyers all ditched us too on the same day. quot   em   There is a miscalculation here. The left always believes they will seize power and keep it  that the tactics they used will never be turned on them. Case in point  the  quot nuclear option quot  for confirming judges.  This allowed Trump to appoint 194 federal appeals court judges   including 3 Supreme Court justices. This happened after only 1 presidential election cycle.  the left relies on freedom of speech and freedom of the press to continue harassing people like trump when they are not in power. But now they have broken the social contract on these issues  and I really hope we let them have it now    Our tolerance has  paradoxically  allowed for their intolerance.  All suppression of speech is abhorrent. It should never be considered a political option. The fact that it  39 s being used indicates some think it isn  39 t.  They  39 re going to make damn sure Republicans never take power again. The scary thing is  they  39 ve got a good chance of pulling it off. I remember the response to complaints about Twitter is   quot Come up with your own platform  quot  Well  someone did and they destroyed it.  Good thing we have the FBI to investigate this obvious  a href  https   www.nolo.com legal encyclopedia content rico act.html  RICO  a  action.  I  39 ve heard RICO being applied here. How does that work in this case  What are the crimes covered in RICO that apply here  Genuinely curious.  They  39 re colluding  the same way the media is.   I expect this article will be blocked promptly amongst every large social media company at the same time.

He  39 s only pulling the plug now because it  39 s safe and it makes him look like he has a conscience.  Is anyone surprised  people legitimately thought alienating and silencing more than half the US population would work in their favor from a business perspective   That s the thing about the left they don t care about money it was all about changing how people think. They would make books  and movies not thinking about the profits  but the effect it would have on the culture.  oh they care about money.  they just truly believe they can force people to bow to them   even after disenfranchising them.  This is true to a point. They do care about money but like you said it is bigger than that. It is about culture wars and controlling information. Money can be made down the track.  It s a long play to avoid being broken up under antitrust law.  I deleted the app and won t be using them along with google or Apple. I know it s not much but I can t stand behind this garbage.  Gab.com is awesome  Tried to make an account yesterday but i guess the servers were too busy. I deleted my Instagram and FB is next as soon as I  39 m set up on gab. If it gets shut down thats that. Im almost 40 i really don  39 t need social media in my life anyway.  Had dame problem. Its super slow  scaling up serves as we speak  so will be faster  but if you just plan on it taking a while and let each page load you can get signed up. It  39 s a REALLY good UI. Gab is legit AF  as the kids say   Guess they didn  39 t think about the 88 or so million followers that follow Trump...  I would love to see millions of people delete their twitter accounts. That would be hilarious  I mean they re still valued higher than they were back in December. Let s wait at least until the market closes before we start making claims about stock prices. Fallout of this weekend s moves likely won t be realized for a quarter or two once engagement metrics are in and advertisers can weigh the impact on their ROI.  Yeah I was about to say... they re still 46  up from where they were 6 months ago  and as I m typing this they re only down 2.7  right now.  Yeah  I  39 m guessing this is more an indication of investor  39 s fearing the fallout than the fallout itself.  Gee  I wonder why banning the President of the United States from a major social media network platform would cause people to lose faith in said social media platform.  I wonder if tax dollars will be used to bail them out in the next stimulus package.  Hahah

Political win win  Gdam Nancy.   There is a fucking week just be patient lol  I said this on Facebook the other day and I found out that if they impeach him and convict him that it denies him his presidential pension  his healthcare  and it bars him from running again. That s the real reason they want impeachment. That s probably why republicans are coming on board. 75 million people feel that they were cheated  add in 4 disastrous years of Biden and Harris  the amount of support for Trump would be astronomical.  I doubt Trump could give a duck s fart for the pension or the health care. It s all about preventing another run.  But trump is so evil  He might hurt people  39 s fragile feelings if we don  39 t take him out and gas all of his followers   Take note of Republicans that vote for impeachment and make sure we remove them from office. I would say the same about Democrats but we all know nanacy will have them drugged and lined up with special interests monies to help them vote the approved way.  No doubt. Currently in  a href   r Alabama  r Alabama  a  people are wanting to oust mo brooks big time. These fucks want to destroy an old mans life over freedom.  All you ever needed to read to know Reddit doesn t represent the real world at all.  Alabama is one of the most strongly polarized states in the nation. Have you considered that maybe an anecdote about alabama is even less representative of the real world in america   Yeah  I  39 m interested to see what happens in the next 2 years. I expect a R primary backlash AND a moderate backlash. Like imagine if dumbass Rs spent months impeaching Obama after he left. Sooo fucking dumb.  The Democrats are unhinged  In other news  the sky is blue  They have completely lost their minds. The House is impeaching Trump a few days before they  39 d be out anyway  TDS truly is a disorder.   removed    removed   There s always that wait 9 fucking days option...  Nancy wants to impeach him so he can t run in 2024.  So why does she care. Trump has obviously damaged his image and reputation it shouldn  39 t matter if he runs again. And if he does  wouldn  39 t the democrats win easy after all trump  39 s done   Dems already know the clusterfuck that America would be once 4 years are up.  But but but   This is just going to set a precedent of impeaching presidents for the littlest things that aren t even true  No  don  39 t you see  he personally gunned down women and children tweeting something nonviolent. Somehow. Just trust us  We know what  39 s best for you   I heard he set the dead bodies of children inside pentagrams  set them on fire  peed on them to put them out  and then ate them.  Haven t they found a reason to try to impeach every republican president simce Reagan   Nah since Clinton actually. Payback for Clinton. Then it was W  didn t go anywhere. Herbert walker was never impeached or investigated.  You  39 d think it would  39 ve opened people  39 s eyes after the first failed attempt. Here we are again though  Speaker of the House and President Pro Tempore need to be nationally elected positions.

I wouldn  39 t doubt it though  party lines are aligned with the incoming administration.  They could have let this go  but removing trump and essentially deleting him will only cause even more trouble. They have turned Trump into a martyr. I think the democrats are baiting another March on the 20th. They want it.  They want their own reichstag fire to justify what more they have planned.  Pelosi  39 s new rules in the House have already done that   hasn  39 t it  If they only sent black trump supporters  at least it would cause massive cognitive dissonance  Those don  39 t exist.  Biden said so.  Yea but they  39 re the good guys  em this time  em   Always remember  they think we  39 re Nazis. If you don  39 t understand that  you don  39 t understand them.

Cleansing a fringe movement  and that  39 s all it is at this point  from American politics is not the same as cleansing a race of people from the planet.  Yeah but it s okay because they re good people and doing it for the right reasons.

Done with them   Facebook is terrible for your health.   It really is.  I had to leave it because of depression.  I banned Facebook five years ago. Been telling my wife she needs to delete hers and just give it a try. Everyday she complains about something on there. She  39 s just not there yet  but I see it coming.  I never use it.  Why would anyone exchange their privacy to keep in touch with friends  amp  families via social media.  You can use group messaging text on your phone.  It s already creepy that bots read everything you post  Cuckerberg listens to everything we say.  I typed that in just to get banned. I m trying to make them delete my account.  Solution.  Steal the stop   Fuck fuckerberg and Jeff bozo  Prevent the Purloin   I wonder why they have not done that since 2016...

Nah  it  39 s the broken clock that  39 s right twice a day.  Where were you guys the past 4  years when conservatives all across America had been raising their hands trying to say something about this   Just a matter of time before the Dems start knocking the ACLU  Then do something about it  In before Democrats also put the  quot Theyre Trump supporters too   Seditionist  Treasonous  Dictators  Fascists quot  label to de ACLU you know  all the  quot buzzwords quot  that trigger people into offensive  its almost like a dog and a whistle.

It  39 s totally in good faith. For America and the Constitution  guys   And if you oppose it  you are a domestic terrorist.  If conservative speech is not protected by the first amendment because it might incite violence  then calling America  quot systemically racist quot  should also be treated as incitement of violence.  This reminds me of the list the Nazis made of all Jewish people and banning them from using transportation  banks  services  etc  It  39 s absolutely amazing. If this were  strong all turned around  strong   and it was Hillary who was POTUS and had her election potentially stolen from her  I  39 d still be upset.  And if Republicans were suggesting the No Fly List be manipulated as  quot punishment quot   a tool  to be used against political foes   I  39 d also be upset.      It  39 s illegal to prevent a congressperson from performing their official duties.  How fascist of her to suggest that...  No no no  they can t be fascist  because they re anti fascist.  Lately I was thinking... The  quot fascists quot  are bad bad bad. Yet  somehow  they have no problems with guys running around with communists symbols ideology propaganda and so on.  This is absolutely insane.  The left has officially lost it  They re gunna try and do as much crazy shit as fast as possible while people are angry and not thinking clearly. It s political opportunism at it s most blatant  Its interesting scary that they are actually going against congressmen.   I just can  39 t believe the clapping seals go along with it.  Those people   primarily seen in  a href   r politics  r politics  a   are truly nothing more than useful idiots.   a href   r politics  r politics  a  is a self delusional hellscape where critical thinking goes to die  You  39 re like 10 years too late on that one the writing was on the wall..  Questioning the election is a terrorist act now. Got it. Don  39 t you dare question those in authority. Imagine Trump started placing verified twitter people on a no fly list because they incited violence. There  39 s thousands.  Anyone else think the dems are crazy enough to steal an election and then instantly go 1984 cos they are scared it will not last till inauguration day.  There is the right  and there is the the reich.  House Homeland Security Committee Chair Bennie G. Thompson  for those who don t want to click in.  Communist at there best . The Democratic Congressman  should be ousted.  They already put peaceful Trump protestors on the list  If it s  actions surrounding last weeks riot  they are targeting then put the entirety of the Dem congress and MSM on the list for inciting hate and violence  Democrats have lost their fucking minds  They are dangerous  Yeah  please help us expose the no fly list as a punitive tool for the political opponents. Not so long ago they had a bright idea to use this list as a source for 2A rights revocation.  Don  39 t they have their own private jets   Just don  39 t led Ted within 50 yards of a park or write to newspapers. Problem solved.

It s such a shocking feat  this is completely scrubbed by the media TODAY.

t3_kv4cqo,Pelosi Snaps At 60 Minutes When Pressed About Holding Up Covid Relief Criticisms From AOC,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv4cqo/pelosi_snaps_at_60_minutes_when_pressed_about/,I cannot for the life of me understand how a single person whether Democrat  independent  progressive or any layperson could ever like or even tolerate Nancy pelosi. She has to be one of the worst person in politics in recent history.  Really actually Gavin is her nephew or metaphorically bc they re all so entangled from their sf politic connection.  I  39 m almost curious enough to go look at her campaigns. I wouldn  39 t be surprised if she just tosses a sign out every few years that says   quot Don  39 t Forget  Vote Me quot  and calls it good.  I live in the bay area... she literally doesn  39 t even campaign.  Lol why would she even bother  She owns the DNC coffers and would never allow anyone to primary her. And there  39 s only like 3 people in her district that don  39 t blindly vote blue no matter who so it  39 s not like she  39 s ever going to get flipped in the GE.  Does anyone campaign against her   DNC would never allow that  As a head of the dnc  I guarantee she fucks around with anyone who dares run against her. I  39 m sure SF would love a far more progressive candidate anyway.  To be fair  it seems like majority don t like her  but I am with you  I don t understand why  em anyone  em  likes her  This doesn t add to the conversation  but when I first saw your flair I thought  damn how did this guy become a veteran conservative   The power of the media in your pocket. Most people are idiot sheep that think what the flashing lights tell them to think.  Eh... Harry Reid wins that race in my opinion.  She is not used to being questioned by the media. This part of the blue moon event is most entertaining   So TL DR   I d only they worked that hard at...working  You think they have guns  They shit themselves watching a Schwarzenegger movie.  Lmao  everytime she gets angry she just repeats herself until eventually blowing up and calling the journalist a right wing shill lol. Kinda sounds exactly like anytime a liberal questions their own. As if even asking the question is an indication they  39 re attacking the party. It  39 s like a religion  don  39 t ask the wrong questions. Actually more like a cult  even a religion would be happy to answer hard questions  not that Nasty was even getting any hard questions in the first place.  I have to say  it  39 s so weird when somebody steps out of line and questions their overlords. It  39 s so rare  so enjoy it while it lasts because we  39 re not getting much more of this soon. The censoring of conservatives this week is the warning shot to all media   quot stay in line for us as you have these past four years or else we  39 re going to do to you what we did to the conservatives. Just because we  39 re in charge now doesn  39 t mean you can start calling us on our shit. quot   It s like when she called Wolf a republican apologist for talking lmao  I know  right  Thats how quick she roasted him on tv  imagine her highness  the dark queen  in a closed door meeting....... quot off with his head     quot   Oh my God  look  60 Minutes is now a real news agency  Says nobody with any intelligence whatsoever.  Lol I know right  little late for that.  Don  39 t worry  they are going after freedom of the press next....for our  quot safety  quot  of course.  She is part of the reason California is fucked up.  Because her nephew Newsom listens to her every request  Anyone notice how often Pelosi snaps now  Between her and Joe we have 160 years of failed embarrassments in US politics. It  39 s fascinating that lefties continue to drink from the cartons of milk that are sour.  Yah but I  39 ll never respect Stahl as a journalist.  They  39 re all scum.  Softball interviews are an insult to American voters. Moderators at Democratic debates are an embarrassment. How telling is it that they do not ask  quot their quot  candidate a fair or tough question because they already know he or she doesn  39 t have a backbone  they just go with what the left wants to get them elected. Whores  all. I will never forget Hillary walking out to the stage on CNN and being greeted with a hug and kiss by Jake Tapper. Yes  this is completely normal in presidential debates. Vile.  Always instructive to see what happens when a democrat receives pushback from the media. First  there  39 s shock   they  39 re clearly caught off guard as this is not the norm from the MSM and as a result their answers are never crisp or even satisfactory because they  39 re forced to deviate from their script.  I find the second part a bit more interesting. I don  39 t know if Pelosi is in denial of her.... Years of wisdom.... But when ever so gently pressed by the press... She becomes quite snarky. She gets all tight lipped and just barely holds back her seething.  Isn  39 t it time Lesley lays her journalist career to rest    See  The SECOND any democrat gets any HINT of a hardball question they completely melt down. They can t handle being treated like trump was these past 4 years  Of course she does  the cunt  doesn t feel that she can even be questioned in her authority.  She  39 s not used to being asked tough questions.  I want to see the full  raw  undoctored interview. There has got to be a handful of gaffes that they are keeping out of the public eye.  This woman exudes big  how dare you  energy  Twin nutjobs.

Trump won in part in 2016 because of the left s attacks on the character of conservatives falsely calling them racist  saying that they were only interested in guns and God. Now the left is trying to stand on the necks of conservatives and choke their voices. Don t they understand that these actions will consolidate the conservatives not bury them   Maybe it will... but I  39 m not so sure  The sad thing is   no one will care.  The left is never held to their own values and standards.  This is still a lesson not learned by some conservatives yet. Somehow we think we can still beat them with our rules.  Gosh  I love that  but I also think that absolutely nothing will come of it. Violence and incitement and hatred is totally fine as long as the leftist doing it. They feel perfectly justified  because they have completely dehumanized and demonized us to the point where even murder is justifiable  see this summer  When it comes full circle and they actually are victims  likely of their own doing  it will be extremely hard to not laugh at them because of this.  The funniest part of it is the liberals complaining about it and calling it Nazi...while they did it first.  Thats been their entire playbook for years now. First accuse whoever of exactly what you  39 re doing to distract from themselves.  Lists are Nazi when the right does them but when the left does them it  39 s accountability. See how they frame it so the opposing side always appears to be doing something to deserve it  The people on the left are fucked in the head.  They totally should make a constant feed of all their hate towards anyone that doesn  39 t agree with them. Is that what this is   Did they ban Gab from Twitter now  I noticed those tweets are gone  Lmao  gab is so based.   Now that  39 s the language I want to hear coming from Gen Z  soy free.

She just goes off color of skin.  AOC   quot Yes quot   Today on  quot everyone who disagrees with me is a Nazi quot ...  She is a complete idiot labeling conservatives as nazis. What a dipshit   Plenty of non nazis were banned   Mostly were just normal conservatives. This divisive bitch and her cult of a following are so brainwashed. Oh and what happened with Mrs  protests are supposed to be uncomfortable   They just wanted bread  AOC   Good way to use that Nazi tactic of labeling anyone who disagrees with you something so sub human and vile.  Next thing is that she  39 ll be calling for  quot unity quot  or maybe this is their unity. Unity through oppression and silencing those who disagree  Whatever is the end result of all this  they will define it as  quot unity quot  by simply making anyone who disagrees functionally invisible.  Exactly  This is coming from the person who didn t even understand Border Security and Laws surrounding it.  If your policies alienate millions of Americans  maybe don  39 t advertise that   Isn t using  neo nazi  incredibly ironic in her case as she has supported numerous public figures who call for the complete obliteration of Israel  Never really understood that.  While also trying to ban guns  force th government further into education  have reeducation camps for people who politically oppose them and removing the voice of any political opponent. All while spouting on about socialist ideals. I dont think they are self aware.  OR... Conservatives are leaving the platform in droves.

How is it that everyone that s against her and the Democrats are being called bro nazis . Could it be because they just might be  the real enemy of the American people enemy of free speech freedom to choose what is good you instead of the government choosing for you . I think we all need to take a closer look at the people that are saying who the enemy is .  It  39 s an old Communist Soviet tactic. Anyone who disagrees with you or engages in wrongthink is a fascist or a Nazi.   We  39 ve reached the stage where if you disagree with a democrat you  39 re automatically a Nazi. The actual discussion topic is irrelevant   this is just a lazy yet surprisingly effective way to smear a person and justify whatever course of action they deem appropriate.  It s effective because libs don t know what a Nazi is or history for that matter.  They just want sound bites with enough  information  to feed their hate.  If they knew history they would realize what obedient little Nazi s they themselves are.  I envy the man who got her shoes.

As with everything else  facts are irrelevant to what Democrats believe.   He was the only thing standing between us and them. And now they are after us.  They hate him because they hate us.  Yeah  before the election I used to regularly comment on this subreddit without getting death threats and stuff. But now everyday I have at least one DM calling me a nazi and i should be wiped off the face of the earth.  Troll them with an easy going brush off or ignore them. They get weirdly angry and adamant when you laugh at their death wishes. Idk why. They think we care they hate us. I pity them  but that s it.  Truth spoken.  This is satire   Was going to say lol  I  39 m curious  did any politicians on the Left meaningfully condemn the months of riots  assaults  harassment  and deaths  Because I  39 ve seen large numbers of non Lefts condemn what happened in DC recently  but my memory is that most Liberals either celebrated BLM Antifa rioting  or pretended like it didn  39 t happen.  It would be one thing if those  mostly peaceful  protests were years ago. But it was only 6 months ago I vividly remember seeing a Mercedes dealership in Oakland get vandalized and at least one car burned up  all to a resounding  meh . Or worse   that s what insurance is for . But NOW they re outraged.  Dear God  any time I see it brought up they  39 re instantly like  quot THAT  39 S DIFFERENT. quot  Then they cite the conscious  deliberate  and complete ongoing genocide of all black people by the 100  corrupt and white supremacist police as being way more worthy of a riot than our claims  which aren  39 t grounded in fact.

How long until a provider suspends service to a police dept that is  quot racist quot   a city that doesn  39 t defund the police  a fed agency that doesn  39 t fall in line with the green agenda   I m not a legal expert by any means but I feel like Amazon has enough money and lawyers to weasel their way out of any real consequences. It s unfortunate but hopefully  Parler finds a new home soon.  Amazon has Joe Biden and Democrats RINOs  Agreed.  Amazon provides services to literally every branch of government.  If anyone thinks for a hot second that Uncle Sam and Uncle Bezos are gonna go against each other  I got a bridge to sell you.  Since parler is gone whats next  Bitchute   Gab  Elon Musk says Signal.  Signal is a WhatsApp Messenger SMS etc replacement  not a Twitter Parler one.  I remember arguing with people years ago about repealing Net Neutrality. Their biggest fear was that internet providers and services would be free to silence opinions they didn  39 t like. In fact  it seems Amazon was against repealing NN for this very reason.  Net neutrality has nothing to do with Amazon kicking Parler off their servers entirely.  Amazon  39 s argument was that without NN  startups would be squashed and opposing views silenced... which is exactly what they are now doing to Parler. That  39 s the connection I  39 m looking at.  In reality  Amazon knew they would have to pay more for the massive amount of bandwidth they use for streaming instead of being subsidized by those smaller companies.  Oh  for sure. As they now show openly  their real concerns were never the little guys  There would likely have been unintended consequences either way. America runs on unintended consequences.  NN was about handing control of speech to the government  nothing more. It was regulation on who was allowed to set up an ISP  entrenching the large players  Comcast ATT etc .  Amazon  39 s argument supporting NN was based in protecting small startups and free speech  two principles they now violate.  Yeap  they so often engage in saying the opposite of what they are doing.  quot Upholding democracy  count every vote quot    gt  silence and remove dissent  Well  Google  39 s motto used to be   quot don  39 t be evil. quot    Don t like our rules  Then start your own damn business     removed   I  39 m appealing to Poe  39 s Law here.

Any amount of violence  even somebody blowing their nose in the wrong direction will be used against us for the next 4 years.  Damn  I hate being allergic to injustice.  Trump said go home in peace. Everyone should do exactly that. Trust in Trump. Stay home.  Seems far too convienent for this tip to be leaked to the media in the midst of a full propaganda campaign to censure all conservative voices.  My thoughts exactly. Back to the  white nationalist  rhetoric. The FBI. What a joke.  If people want to protest I support it  but it doesn t seem to make any difference. There were 2 big DC protests before the 6th and they were completely ignored. The masses have been brainwashed so effectively they think our opinion can be ignored and erased. I m not sure what the next step is  but if we don t get voter reform we are fucked.  Remember...hitler orchestrated an attack on his own soldiers as an excuse to invade Poland.  Reichstag fire got the Nazis a lot of excuses to clamp on opposition.  I was going to add this as well  They are trying to bait people into a conflict and looking for some great optics to spread propaganda.   Damned if you do  damned if you don t   Where do you think Bush Jr. got the idea for 9 11   My question is do they think doing any of the censorship  blacklisting  canceling  ect is going to make anything better for the 20th or is their goal just to piss people off so much that come the 20th something happens and it goes downhill from there.  Their goal is to piss people off  make them extreme  and record the optics to help their propaganda campaign. Then remove all resistance completely. Now that trump is out they hope to get back to getting filthy rich at the expense of the working class.   I feel like the language is purposely ominous.  I  for one  am in Oklahoma.  Constitutional carry.  Of course we  39 re armed.  If we  39 re at a protest  its an armed protest.  If we  39 re at the store  its an armed shopping spree.  If we  39 re at church  its an armed service.  If we  39 re at a restaurant  its an armed meal.  I thought we weren t concerned about protesters  and that protests were generally fiery but mostly peaceful   I  39 m sorry but I don  39 t think this is legitimate.  Conservatives are known for having jobs and the inauguration is on a Wednesday.  I would also add that the FBI doesn  39 t have much credibility right now.  My work just sent out a civil unrest bulletin. Last time we got that was when the Philippines had open season on drug addicts. I ve not  em heard  em  anything about an official protest and I m usually aware of them.  Hope this is not true. We need to calm down  and figure an effective way to fight the injustices that are occurring. We need to fight without violence.  If you go on Gab you  39 ll see how almost every comment is  quot dont go for the armed protests  its leftist groups hijacking the movement quot      x200B   Sounds like an excuse to send federal agents to whatever town they deem  could  have protests.  We had dudes stand in front of our court house the other day waving trump flags.  I would think it would take them at least 3 years to come to this conclusion.  Not when they  39 re the ones responsible for it.

Whoever wrote and published the book is pretty brave. I hope they did so with as much anonymity as possible.

I would tell them to look in the mirror  but I have seen antifa mug shots and know that they probably don t own one  Ok  seriously  what is it with those guys  Are they all homeless meth heads  They all loo like it  every single one.  Funny thing is that they all look like homeless runaways yet they have vehicles to travel from city to city with professionally made signs and weapons. No doubt they are being funded.  And the girls are proving the blue haired feminist trope time and time again  Maybe they are like the Hitler youth and all have standardized haircuts  Maybe they have a look book they can choose from    Where can I get this book that isn  39 t from a book vendor that supports the suppression of ideas  Powell  39 s is out. Amazon is out. Barnes and Noble is out. No small mom and pop places anywhere remotely around me.  I m sure Amazon won t stock it.  These people need a hobby.  LOLOLOLOL remember  these weirdos really think they are anti fascists.  It  39 s probably one page front side only  written in comic sans. We all know their tactics anyway  The left keeps telling me Antifa doesn t exist. If they don t exist  why do they care if someone writes a book about them   because censoring anything negative about you is not fascist  I guess   Forgive me I just woke up. So Antifa is no longer an ideology.
t3_kv6uda,Trump shows no signs of resigning amid U.S. Capitol fallout,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv6uda/trump_shows_no_signs_of_resigning_amid_us_capitol/,For people that wanted a peaceful transition of power they sure seem to be in a rush to push him out.  People on  a href   r politics  r politics  a  are saying how we are defending him not getting impeached and stuff  but like  he literally had one more week it s not that hard to wait  The point of Impeachment at this stage would to bar him from running again in 2024.  I don t think running him again would be wise. Need someone younger and more articulate but with his same energy. Someone more presidential that doesn t piss away voters with needlessly brash tweets.  Ted Cruz  Please no. The guy has the charisma of a bean salad  They wanted Trump to get down on his knees and kiss Biden  39 s ass. That  39 s the only  quot peaceful transition quot  they wanted to see. Since they aren  39 t getting that  they  39 ve just redefined  quot peaceful transition quot  to mean ousting an elected President via an actual coup  amp  making sure he can  39 t disrupt their system of corruption ever again.  Only peaceful if you conform to their world views. They don t want peace  they want conformity.  Yeah no kidding  He literally only has 1 week and a few days left.....people need to chill the fuck out.  Meanwhile  we have a pandemic to deal with but our royalty would rather focus on giving trump one last middle finger.  Kinda tells you the true seriousness of the pandemic.  He said something  some extremists took it the wrong way and  got violent. Name president who this didn  39 t happen under. Obama indirectly caused someone to murder five cops in Dallas. Sanders indirectly caused someone to open fire at Republicans at a baseball game. I  39 m no Trump supporter  but I fail to see how is this is any different.  He explicitly told them to be peaceful... Right before they left  The difference is  you are dealing with power hungry nutcases. They  39 ve been starved out of power for 4 years and they can  39 t wait to get back and rip everyone to shreds for denying them power.   Good he shouldn  39 t.  Why would he resign   Why would he  Baseless resignation is for cowards.  Trump is a master troll  he will wait until the last second just to make the liberals cry.  It did occur to me that if it were looking like he might be removed from office  he would resign like 60 seconds before the final vote.  Which is why they are pushing a post facto impeachment idea.  Screw all these repubs calling Trump a quitter when he took every legal and strategic avenue against the election irregularities. Even if he did leave the public eye his political generational legacy is sealed not to mention also represented by 75  disenfranchised voters and international patriots. He really has started a new movement and he won t even live long enough to see the end of it.  He shouldn  39 t resign  and on the day he  39 s supposed to leave the White House he should pretend he  39 s walking in slow motion while he steals all of the toilet paper out of the bathrooms.  Why would he  This is the last way you get someone like Trump to resign...  Because fuck cancel culture that s why  He wont resign so they used their tears to draw up articles of impeachment.   Fuckin  39  A right.
t3_kvd7aj,Facebook Says It Is Removing All Content Mentioning Stop the Steal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvd7aj/facebook_says_it_is_removing_all_content/, Does not apply to Stacey Abrams  At this point if you re a conservative and you haven t deleted your Facebook you are a part of the problem. Download all your pics  easy button to do it in the settings  message anyone you actually care about with your number and other ways to stay in touch  and delete it. Encourage others to do the same.   I m torn here. I m not sure whether it s better to do a mass exodus from social media or for us to remain on until they force us off  and continue to spread our ideas in the public sector. I m sure with some of my friends  I am the only conservative voice but they ever hear  and I am very  very careful and moderate about what goes on my Facebook  because people from work follow me  Mass exodus. Facebook makes all of its money advertising to you. If 10s of millions leave they lose serious money and their stock will take a beating.   I see your point. No  I m definitely not apolitical  but I am also cautious about the way that I word things so I don t lose my job. Then again  not having a Facebook would definitely prevent that  That s how I made my decision today. If I m to the point where I m censoring what I post on my own account  then why do I have it  It s just going to make life a lot easier to not have to worry about it at all and spend my time doing more productive things.  As soon as you remove all the Russian collusion shit that  39 s still up  that was never taken down nor had corrections issued after President Trump was found not guilty of collusion.  1984  This is the prequel to 1984... we get to see how it all started.  1983  But  resist  is ok.  Only Democrat approved resistance is OK.   removed   A lot of people already have. Personally I haven t had Facebook in years as I found no value from it and I ve just recently deleted Twitter.  I  39 m only using it to follow groups I like  but I guess I have reddit for that.  Twitter was hard for me to leave only because I probably spend too much of my time following sports and it s easy to get trade rumors and such on there even though I disliked everything else about the platform. Now I just pay closer attention to ESPN and the sorts.  Made my final tweet and instagram posts an hour ago. Im done.   I think you need to actually request for the account to be closed in order to make a difference.  Right. I am more or less just  quot parking quot  my accounts. Don  39 t want anyone claiming my name. Deleted both apps from my devices.  Stop considering  do it.  Should I be reporting my neighbors with the signs to the FBI   Good thing I m a horrible speller  Stahp tha steel   60  of the time works every time  Delete you re account and watch their stocks pummel to the ground.  They  39 re gonna try and remove all evidence that this ever happened.  Gotta wonder when they ll come after this subreddit.

True. I wish most of these companies operate under the constitution as their headquarters are located here. Too bad most people look away as real censorship is actually happening.  Yes  because any country valuing it  39 s freedoms can see the handwriting of where this is going. Is the Left going to de platform the world in hopes that this is going to bring about a One World Order   no descent  no free thinking  Anybody really jazzed about living like the Chinese   Australia is owned by China. We sold everything off to them already. They are now hurting us big time with huge tariffs put on to wreck our industries. We have a left wing media that governments always try to appease and will sign up for the new world order in a flash selling out its people and its people will submit.  I ve been out of the loop of Australian news the past couple of months. What happened to ScoMo  I swear Australia changes prime ministers more than some people change their socks.  ScoMo  39 s still the PM  he  39 s just on leave for a week.  Then do something about it   Don t be fooled by the Australian government.

t3_kv34gx,Biden Priority For Economic Business Relief To Be Made Based In Part On Race Gender,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv34gx/biden_priority_for_economic_business_relief_to_be/,I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin  but by the content of their character.   Martin Luther King  Jr.  TIL MLK Jr is racist.  He  39 d easily be a conservative today.  Regardless of how he votes he  39 d be a sane voice and we need more of those.  They are drowned out by the mass of morons.  Being a moron with your speech is still protected under the first amendment.  Oh yeah totally  if you ignore the fact he hated capitalism.  Outside of the socialism  probably.  No shot  he was socialist.  I am not so sure. Joe Biden would be a conservative today if had the same values that he had 20 years ago as a democrat.....  Xiao Biden has no values that I can detect  other than the ones he gets in the earpiece.  Swamp creature for 47 years  This is exactly what people don  39 t account for in historical figures over time changing.  lol funniest thing I  39 ve seen all day.   It  39 s a bit much  but the way they treated MLK in that vid is how they are treating Trump right now.  MLK has been rolling in his grave so hard the past 9 months you could hook his skeleton up to a dynamo and it  39 d generate clean electricity.  Or whether or not they wear a pussy hat.        Fighting Systemic Racism with Systemic Racism.  This is quite ... racist. Are we counting Asians as whites still or is that just for college admission   Asians are honorary whites apparently.  So are Cubans. And black and Hispanic conservatives. All female conservatives are white too ofc.         ...and Disneyland passes.  Aren t they the richest demographic in the country   I think technically it  39 s like first generation Nigerian immigrants who are.  Asians are too hardworking to be considered a minority  So white males do not apply.   Don t forget asians. They are not a  real  minority per dems.  No because when they are included as minorities  they skew the whole narrative of  quot whites outperform minorities due to racism. quot   Did you see the Asians lost their lawsuit against Harvard   Discrimination is ok in certain cases     They re only a minority when it s convenient to leftists.  Nope because Asians have surpassed  quot whites quot  on the socioeconomic ladder.  Asians overwhelmingly voted for Biden. This is what they voted for.  In America  sure. In the world   Absolutely not. Between China and India alone  that  39 s near 3B ppl  a third of the world  39 s population.  Hunter Biden exempt    How dare another white man try to live as comfortable and privileged as me.    Joe Biden probably   deleted    quot All animals are equal  but some animals are more equal than others quot   white males don  39 t need jobs when you got  quot 10  to the big guy quot  coming in every month...what  you guys don  39 t have that too     Already calling for divisive policy before he  39 s even seated. It  39 s gonna be a long LONG 4 years  folks.  It ll be even longer when Kamala takes over and has even greater radical changes.  4  Get fucking real. After they give blanket citizenship to 10 million   illegal immigrants the left will control the government for the next 2 decades.  Sue him for civil rights violations  Can  39 t. Our courts have proven they support fascism. Our laws mean nothing  Introduce policies based on race  what could possibly go wrong  This is what happens when the president elect has the critical thinking skills of a bag of hammers.  So much for the 14th amendment...  Sue  Awesome because I just started identifying as a black woman   I see white business in my area closing at the same rate as black   minority businesses.  They re all struggling.. but sure let s dangle relief money in peoples faces based off of race.  We  39 ve had similar laws like this in South Africa for more than 20 years. It   Exactly as you said. Every white person I know  from the educated to the poorest  either want to leave or plan to do so. I  39 m one of them. You have your more patriotic ones as well of course who would stay no matter what. I don  39 t know what to make lf that.   I read through this article. All lies. He say s it  but will not follow through. The very business he speaks of will be crushed by the end of his term  or Commala s term  if you will.  It  39 s Democrat Kungflu policies that are crushing small and minority businesses.  KungFlu... lol  .. I ve heard ChinaVirsus or ChinaFlu too.  Really triggers the libtards  How does that not violate anti discrimination laws   Well  Biden is a racist and a sexist.  We knew this already.  I just wonder if the entire Democrat party and Liberals as a whole are going to fall in line and out themselves as the same racists and sexists   Well  I  39 m already black. I am announcing now I identify as a stunning and brave woman.   Isn  39 t that racist  No  I forgot racism doesn  39 t apply towards white people...  Crazy that the ideology I grew up in is now the party of racism  bigotry  and discrimination. The fact that these people now openly defend it is insane.  Wow.   White and Asian males can get fucked I guess.  Sad.  Yeah screw small businesses that are struggling  but the owner is white.  I have four daughters and they will all buy guns with that money. Get fucked.  Assuming it  39 s still possible to buy guns by then. Better buy what you can now.  I saw a yeet cannon for  600 on armslist lol.  Problem   you have a wonderful multicultural country  thankfully getting more diverse every day  but one group  white males  found and run around three quarters of all businesses. Not fair.  Whiskey  tango  foxtrot   Segregation is back baby   Fucking idiot  Guess what handouts I ve gotten as a white male  None. Guess what I had to do to make up for it  Work my     off. I ve got no problem with that.  Classic leftist racism.  Nice  that  39 s racist  em and  em  sexist. Good job you old puppet POS.  I  39 m still waiting for my  2 000 stimulus check he promised that would go out the second Georgia put in those two Democrats.  Smh. Whatever. Idiot in charge  It s evolving just backwards  Don t worry guys  I ve been reliably informed that Biden s a moderate and firmly stands on principle. He won t shift positions at the drop of a hat   s  Well  that  39 s racist  I don t care anymore  the commies have rotted the foundation of our country  everyone is stupid and everything is dumb  burn it all down and let s start over. I don t care anymore.  Too bad the SCOTUS is compromised  since this is clearly a violation of both the 14th amendment and discrimination laws.  Well the most common last name in America is now Patel...so does this make white people minorities now   Uh... sue that motherfucker for discrimination.  Damn that sure sounds pretty racist and sexist.  Thats the definition of racism. Discrimination by the color of someone  39 s skin.  Tell me this is satire...  Divide the Americans more on race and gender and rule them   What on Earth does that look like  Joe    We need some folks to sue over this the moment it gets enacted. The key is finding a white male owned business who qualifies for whatever they have in mind and who is denied based on nothing other than race and sex and this one is a slam dunk under the 14th Amendment. People really need to be ruthless in the courts with this stuff. This is the first steps toward the stuff that s happening in South Africa these days.  The Biden admin is already promising racist policies  Imagine that.  Ahh yes the answer to race discrimination on the right is discrimination from the left. Ffs. Malcom x and MLK are spinning in their graves. A friend of mine summed it up best when he said  quot  the democrats know there is money and votes in exploited black emotions. quot   We  39 re all going through a Pandemic. Why is systemic racism now acceptable

It s not leftists calling for violence online like most people here seem to think.  God I hate Twitter.  Yeah  they absolutely should. They did eventually ban this one at least.  I don  39 t think most think that hashtag is coming from the left  pretty sure most know where it  39 s coming from.  People are just pointing out the hypocrisy of it all.  It  39 s against a Conservative  so they  39 re allowing it to trend.  That  39 s right...we are no longer just deplorables...we are now F  CKING deplorables.

If libtards go full bore and do everything they  39 ve promised to this point... They will lose the senate and house the next cycle. With Trump not on the ballot and Biden running amuck  America won  39 t stand for it. Same thing happened to Obama after he passed the ACA. Lost both house the next cycle.
t3_kvfnaf,Amazon partner GoDaddy boots gun site from its servers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvfnaf/amazon_partner_godaddy_boots_gun_site_from_its/,What does all this accomplish   Quite a bit actually. The reverberations of these moves by big tech are going to be felt for a long time. The banana republics that these big tech corporations have become at the behest of their far left employees will certainly lead to some interesting years ahead.  What will all this accomplish  Your reply says nothing. What a worthless comment. Say what you mean to say. Literally all you said is reverberations are going to be felt for years ahead. Like what  The vague edginess is just agitating.  This is the fascism that they accused the Trump administration of practicing.  Nothing. Arfcom  quot being down quot  greatly depended on what DNS each person was using. Site staff had a new domain up and running before it went completely dark. Then about 30 minutes later Godaddy restored the registration.  Big market available for regular  decent people if Amazon  Microsoft  and Google will host for only leftist morons.  Trick is getting startup money.  Amazon  39 s a behemoth now  but when they started they bled investor money for years before they got into the black.  hence the rumor Trump will be one of those people.  Koch Bros and their gang of donors along with Musk could have platform running by tomorrow.  Musk donates privately to a lot of smaller startups  he personally does not have time to dive too deep into these things.  It  39 s all happening so fast.  GoDaddy has been a slimy company since day one. Last year I had to buy a domain I wanted from them but transferred it to NameCheap as soon as I was allowed to. The year before I was waiting for another domain registered with them to expire and paid them to  a href  https   ca.godaddy.com domains domain backorder  watch it for me  a  so I  39 d have first dibs if the old owner  who hadn  39 t used it in several years  didn  39 t renew it. The domain had actually already expired and was just a few days from the end of its 30 day grace period when it would be put up for auction. Suspiciously 12 hours after I paid them to watch the domain the owner magically remembered about it and renewed it. Of course the fee I paid to GoDaddy wasn  39 t refundable. I  39 m certain they told the old owner someone was waiting to pick it up so they could keep my money as well as the renewal fee.  Godaddy is absolute trash and you are 100  correct. Idk if they still do this but if you type in a domain to buy and decide not to  they ll go ahead and buy it  and then charge your ass an Upcharge.  Question is  do we all dare say peace out to all the big tech companies  I m fine dropping all Amazon services and cancelling memberships. Facebook is lame  I ve already cancelled Twitter. I was already concerned about the loss of local businesses before these big tech shenanigans  so I m fine shopping local.
t3_kv8ozz,New push to kill Section 230 protections for Twitter Facebook big tech,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv8ozz/new_push_to_kill_section_230_protections_for/,Removing 230 would be absolutely horrible for any web based business  especially the small ones. That is not the solution.  I think that ideally section 230 would be more of a spectrum of protections granted based on how much moderation is applied. No moderation   max protection. More moderation   less protection  They still have to moderate legally for things like CP... that was actually the intent of 230 just to remove blatantly illegal material.  100 .  Section 230 repeal is exactly what Zuckerberg and Dorsey want.  Don t give it to them.  Isn  39 t the issue just some of the wording in 230  If I understand it correctly it  39 s something like  quot platforms can remove things that are illegal  etc  etc  or otherwise undesirable quot . Wouldn  39 t just amending the wording be the right way to go   Wish they would have done it before now... I don t like their chances when the democrats know big tech is helping push their agenda.  They have zero motivation to do it at this point.  Politics can make strange bedfellows.  There might be some support from the socialist wing of the Democrats because A  they enjoy fucking over large corporations and B  they should suspect that they will be next on the social media chopping block  because Big Tech will want to silence some of the far left Democrats who make the party look nuts.  Good point.  Maybe they would help force some of the big tech companies to break into multiple companies at least.  Remember  big tech wants regulation.  This should have happened years ago. Better late than never  if it actually passes  .  Idgaf about reform anymore. REMOVE IT  Yes  because this will get far in a Democrat House  a Democrat Senate  and a Democrat White House.  s  Oh  now they  39 re pushing for it.  After they let an election get stolen from them.  The Republicans showing everyone they  39 re as useless as ever.  That push is going to absorbed by the woke crowd in Washington before it gets anywhere.

If you re not with us you re against us    censored Ron Paul for posting the same column he  39 s published since 1976 with no warnings whatsoever.  Guess libertarians are too far to the right for commiebook.  This is overreacting.  Americans are good at overreacting.  Libertarianism is great in theory but is just not feasible in a world with so many bad actors.   Looks like next election Libertarian is helping out Republican to win

Ok  you got me  that was funny as hell lmao  It  39 s honestly not as good as the title makes it out to be.  pessimism aside it  39 s a really good sign that not only are foreign countries watching  but speaking up and siding with Trump  even if they don  39 t agree with him and have been his adversary for the last 4 years. it means CCP doesn  39 t have control of the flow of information that they think they do.  She  39 s full of shit.  She  39 s part of the problem  people don  39 t realize how important this is. foreign countries are watching us.  In addition to interfering with our elections.  indeed.

t3_kvh6m6,President Donald J. Trump Approves District of Columbia Emergency Declaration,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvh6m6/president_donald_j_trump_approves_district_of/,Does anyone know why exactly this is happening   Very interesting indeed. Wonder if there s a 4D chess move behind this or not...if it was purely because of the riot then he could have declared this much earlier.  What 4d chess move could this possibly be  Not entirely sure. He s had a lot of options available to him the whole time but he knowingly chose to wait and go the way of the courts because that s the  right thing to do .  Insurrection act.  If he was going to he would have already.  He had to wait for the China EO to come into effect so all of Congress would be guilty of treason  Take note of the national guard being brought in to DC. Governors are sending in thousands of troops. It s being claimed that  violent protests  will be taking place at state capitols. There is a  very  likely chance that Antifa will be targeting these capitols  posing as Trump supporters. In fact  they re trying to convince us that Trump supporters are going to riot at the Twitter headquarters in San Fran. This is their supposed reason for the massive amount of NG troops.   It doesnt to me. It feels like Trump has given in bro. Im sorry but you  39 re on the conspiracy theorist side if you think antifa is dressing up as Trump supporters to false flag something. The capitol riot was Trump people. It was. There WERE antifa people there  but the majority was Trump supporting people. As for whats yet to take place we will see  but its incredibly unlikely there  39 s false flags occurring across the country on inaguration day.  If that s your view  I can t change it. I can only speak to my experience. Here s what I know   I saw videos of security letting people into the capitol. I saw videos of weapons being passed out to people. I saw videos of Trump supporters calmly walking between the ropes in the capitol  polite as could be. I saw videos of Trump supporters vocally calling out and identifying Antifa. I saw videos of Trump supporters trying to stop those who were breaking the windows.   I think theyd totally be willing to. I saw all the same footage you mentioned there too. I agree the media is scummy. But the capitol riot WAS trump supporters. And just like every riot  not everyone there was  em rioting  em   I genuinely don t understand what you just said. You just said you believe they d be willing to do all the things I talked about. Then the next sentence you say the riot WAS Trump supporters.   Yup. I think theyd be willing to.... Im not convinced this one WAS. Big difference. Not hard to understand. I havent seen any proof this was orchestrated by antifa.  We haven t seen any evidence proving that it was all Trump supporters  either. Nothing has been proved. And there is very reasonable motive and logic pointing to the fact that it  em could  em  have been Antifa.   I wonder if it has anything to do with the FBI report of armed protests in Washington and also in all state capitals. Things seem to be reaching a boiling point with Democrats stirring the pot  what s new   and Republicans not offering any leadership in how to defend their rights and our rights in a peaceful manner.  that explains the 10 000 troops. sorry to some of you that thought it was the insurrection act lol  It was for the inauguration... he was asked to declare it a state if emergency for the inauguration and he did.  Darn it...

Seriously mods can we make a rule about reposted of almost the same stories  It fractures conversations and makes it hard to find new worthwhile topics.  I tried to do something about it as a mod  they booted me as a mod lol  Dude relax  amp  take it.   The medal is really chocolate  People want politics out of the game. This is BB keeping politics out of the game.  By citing a political reason   You make a great point...  As a Bostonian and Pats fan  I ll say Belichick does everything humanly possible to eliminate distractions. As big of a Trump supporter as he is  and he s been one since the beginning   he s not trying to deal with the political drama that could come out of it. He s keeping politics out of football and we could use more of that.  Fellow Bostonian here. You  39 re right. There would be backlash from people  the left . Not sure why he cares  but he does. I  39 m on his side on this one.  He and Brady both voted for him. They don  39 t want to deal with the drama. Better shit to do.

t3_kuuzim,Bollywood Actress Kangana Ranaut slams Twitter CEO after ban on Trump Islamists nation and Chinese propaganda has bought you completely you only stand for your petty gains... U are nothing but a little slave of your own greeds. Dont preach again its embarrassing.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuuzim/bollywood_actress_kangana_ranaut_slams_twitter/,Have no idea who she is but she ain t wrong   She s a Bollywood actor. It seems that Bollywood gt Hollywood  yh its not owned by china  Twitter fr on their knees sucking Xi Jin Pings tiny asian dick for money  Indian here  Bollywood is an industry that is  very  apolitical  only a very few outspoken people like Kangana Ranaut are exceptions. Not to mention  she  39 s at odds with the rest of Bollywood for peddling drug allegations and shit against them. Apolitical reasons again.  A quick google search gives multiple accounts of here being taken to court for defamation over what she tweets  and that she bullies other actresses. These are all just in the last few days. Not exactly somebody to be referenced to prove a point here.  True  but she s an A list actress at her peak. Imagine Jennifer Lawrence or Margot Robbie supporting Trump.    Looking into it  I don  39 t think she cares about Trump one way or another. She cares that there is a chance to discredit twitter to help her own defamation case. If someone defamed her using twitter I  39 m sure she would say the opposite to give the platform credence. She is unaffected by US politics  but is vested in how twitter is viewed. Politics aside  she appears to be a spiteful person who can act.  let me assure you that the Bollywood actors of actual repute are better at grammar and punctuation  They probably don t diddle children in Bollywood  Uhhh.... yea... the hub of child exploitation and all that... but its a nice sentiment.  So just like hollywood  but in india  At barely legal age  19 I think    Kangana had an affair with a married dude who later assaulted her and he s been accused of underaged diddling. Don t let Bollywood fool you.  ....lol  The indians aren  39 t hard up for Chinese.... Money.  Bollywood action movies are a great gift to man kind.  So celebrities are aloud to speak out only if they agree with you   In India she is considered an attention seeker.  But she is gonna be banned soon.  Meanwhile... Hollywood stars are too scared to speak up.  Of course  they are one Chinese tantrum away from being unemployable in Hollywood.  Same thing is happening in Washington DC  and in every major news organization in the country.  They re not scared  they agree with it  lol. exactly. Hollywood has been beating the  quot Trump is bad quot  drum for years now.  Maybe they don  39 t want an Orwellian situation where the government can force private companies to plaster the face and slogan of the leader onto their products. Who knows.  Unless you re James Woods.  In which case the left tries to silence and push him out of work. But if the right were to do the same stunts  there would be outrage and  em gasp  em  rioting.  Or  Randy Quaid  Mental illness is a Terrible thing   Or Hercules  Panderin in mandarin  Hollywood stars are reprobate perverts. Expect nothing from those trashbins  In India  being conservative is generally not so uncommon looked down upon  and Indian Twitter is also right leaning. Basically  what I want to say is that being a conservative in India is not as hard as being a conservative in the USA.  Indian Twitter is right leaning because of users but lots of old media is still left.Unfortunately Twitter shadow bans many popular right wingers to help left.  I  39 m pretty centrist regarding our country  39 s issues  but recently  the right wing mainstream media is also catching up  imo.  It is but now they are trying to silence Arnab by hook or crook.  And you are mad about that  It is about time. I was getting sick of seeing out of touch celebrities weigh in on issues.  Nah  they re speaking up  and some are asking when the last time an actor assassinated a president   deleted   I mean if they speak up or go against the narrative grain they get black listed and their careers are over. A lot of prominent early 2000s actors out of the spot light because of it  Such as   With more foreign influencers from non western governments speaking out about this shows how far western civilization has fallen. However  it does give me some hope that If the US ever falls than there are other countries out there that might take the mantle of the United States ideology of rights and governance.  People outside of the United States have a very different perspective on what is happening.  This is it.  Foreign country here   this is not my experience. My news is very heavily Trump focused  so I  39 m aware of a lot of the last 4 years highlights almost as much as a US viewer.  This is such a good point. they  39 re treating it as a 9 11 style terrorist attack. The 60 minutes preview  I wouldn  39 t watch such garbage  was an absolute hyperbolic joke. Though I would expect nothing less from our awful media.  Trump is an amazing way for Canadians to forget that our own leader is an actual traitor criminal and getting away with it.  Before Trump should be banned those Chinese motherfuckers  wolf warriors  should be the first ones.  Vladimir Putin openly stated in an interview the moment a country disobeys it s own constitution is when we interfere. Paraphrased  of course  but it s something to think about in terms of outcome.  Yeah and than he Just changed constitution for his needs  And the Democrats are breaking their own rules but we can  39 t call that out  apparently.  Not on Twitter or Parlor  at least.  source please   India loves Trump  FYI.  I like the Indian people  I work with a lot of them. Fine people.  That sounds like a Trump quote  except it needs an exclamation point at the end  and it s true  they are decent and hard working .   quot Some of the best. Everybody knows it. quot   I have tons of Indian friends. Very hardworking smart people.  There is a gas station between me and my work that an indian guy owns. He s a really cool guy  and I used to go in there so much that he gave me a coffee one morning on the house because I was constantly in there buying stuff. Always smiling  always cheerful  and I ve never met a guy that loved American values more than him.  This is true.  Also because India despises China and Trump clearly hates China as well.  Seattle tech guy and I can 100  confirm  Ironically it  39 s because they are caught up in Identity politics. They like the anti Islamic rhetoric  am Indian   And India hates China  a href  https   www.google.com search q india china amp source lnms amp tbm nws amp sa X amp ved 2ahUKEwiT4bjAnZPuAhWj1FkKHQwJDrwQ AUoAXoECDMQAw amp biw 1269 amp bih 842  https   www.google.com search q india china amp source lnms amp tbm nws amp sa X amp ved 2ahUKEwiT4bjAnZPuAhWj1FkKHQwJDrwQ AUoAXoECDMQAw amp biw 1269 amp bih 842  a   India loves Trump because India and Trump hate China.  It s because India is probably the largest threat in the region to Chinese power. And China has totally bought Dems and Silicon Valley.  Yeah. India is a very good counter to Chinese madness.  Indian born in Punjab raised in the USA can confirm we  Sikh community is all for trumps and family s value conservative values. Proud to be an American sad to see people so blind to the obvious destruction to our democracy  Fuck yeah   India is a country that tried socialism and it failed. Now they are growing strong and quickly turning around the tides of poverty with capitalism. It s funny you ll never see democrats discuss India.  Inda has been plagued with major corruption issues in their extensive bureaucracy. You think election fraud is bad in the US  You should see elections in some parts of India  Yeah  they distribute money and liquor just before the elections  even though it is illegal. Indian elections have a lot of funny business going on. Corruption is very deep over here.  Lol no. This is so wrong on many levels. But as expected such bias will always be upvoted in this subreddit.  Lmao no. I  39 m Indian and the Indian govt is fucking trash regardless of party. They  39 re so corrupt and corporations fuck over every normal person. The govt actively lets companies poison their own people for money  To me it seems like non Americans such as Indians and Hong Kongers like Trump more than Americans  No they don  39 t. They hate censorship that  39 s it.  Bet she  39 s banned by Tuesday  I ll give  em 11 minutes  Found the optimist   The rest of the world sees how dangerous this is   We need more people to be vocal about censorship. Let the whole world learn from the folly of the Americans.  Folly of big tech and rabid leftists   How do you know they aren  39 t   That  39 s the point of censorship     Flaired users only.  Make no mistake. The leftists in silicon valley are pushing authoritarian censorship for their own ideological reasons.  The country is on a fast track to a Left wing authoritarian style government.  Do you actually think this   Sadly  yes.  Soon any kind of right leaning speech will be banned from Twitter or Facebook.  This very sub we  39 re posting on probably won  39 t be here much longer.  You re massively overreacting.    strong flaired users only  strong   Who do you think has the most authority in the United States  The government. If a single person were to be selected  then it would be the President.   I am not a Republican but often vote for the Republican candidate. Republicans need to scream from the rooftops what is happening in America. Freedom of speech is being attacked. Everyone ought to be afraid   What the hell does Trumps childish stunts have to do with Islam or China   I agree with her  in part  however some the people behind this political purge are Indian immigrants working at high levels of many of the big tech corporations.  If so  they are probably on H1B visas and have no choice. If they lose their jobs they have to leave the country if they can  39 t find another within 60 days. Trying to lower the amount of H1Bs was one of the major reasons big tech hated Trump.  People at at that higher level of management would be already citizens or permanent residents.  This lady knows the deal.  All these tech giants have been bought  amp   have sold out to China.  Looks like this was from at least a few years ago. But is truer today than ever. Edit  Jack  39 s tweet was from 2015  but her reply was recent.  There is a particular irony in the anti censorship fervor across the sub where a vast majority of posts get tagged for flaired users only.  I didn  39 t think of this  lol   Liberal here with a legitimate question. Isn t the flaired users only thing a form of censorship on your part  Thanks in advance for any answers. Enjoy your day.  The world needs more Bollywood. Change my mind.  CHINA JOE .... BINGO  Yeah but trump has a literal press room. He s not a victim.  She  39 s right you know  Twitter and leftists are so sensitive they can  39 t handle a different opinion anymore....  Just checking to see if I can comment since everything in this sub has been flair only.  As an Indian immigrant  came here in 1st grade but whatever . Indians love Trump      As an Indian resident  please don  39 t generalize  The only glimmer of hope I see right now is the backlash over the bans. If they can ban Trump  they can ban anyone.  So  we  39 re cool with celebrities making statements on politics as long as they agree with us   I didn  39 t know who this was  but I do now   thank you Kangana.  If people in other countries see there s a problem. Why can the dems   The fact that others see it across nations.... We need more of Kangana.  Indian here. Kangana Ranaut isn  39 t really a good person to have on your side lol. The woman is nuts.  The left has always been about banning free speech they don t like. Just try and bring any conservative to an American university. The Twitter van will be used by China and Iran and Russia to justify their own censorship.  I  39 m loving India right now. Only if they economy can match up to China  39 s asap.  Whether you agree or disagree with someone  39 s ideas  you don  39 t defeat their ideas by banning them  but you defeat them by refuting them with evidence. Banning the ideas of others is a form of intellectual bankruptcy   I disagree with what you say but will fight to my last breath to defend your right to say it.   While I disagree with Twitter banning Trump  they did not do it for gain or greed. Twitter lost  10  of their value in stocks because of this. In fact  they might get in trouble for taking an action that hurts their stock holder s interests.  It s almost like companies try to make money. Huh fascinating  People are starting to wake tf up   Well  she s not wrong.  It s a slippery slope  and those in the part of the world that have seen authoritarian regimes are in a good position to know.  Imagine being upset about extremists being banned from a forum they pay nothing to use.  Twitter isn t banning Islamic terrorists. That s the problem.  SomeBlackGuy on youtube got banned from Twitter after this  and he s not even conservative.   We wont give a fuck because it s twitter  Sooo twitter taught me that doubting election results and wanting to investigate is totally illegal but a government bragging about how they re setting up concentration camps  that s just fine. You re also allowed to call for burning books and science written by people of a certain skin color.  Amen to this.  Maybe if the best sources you can find to agree with you are Bollywood stars no one has ever heard of  you are on the wrong side of things.  Lads as an Indian. And as someone who understands conservatives. Trust me she  39 s an absolute moron. Has no brains and will take every opportunity to ride the limelight.  Yep  she  39 s doing this to gain some following but truthfully  she has no dog in this fight. America and India are different landscapes politically.  I wouldn  39 t say we  39 re so different man. We  39 ve both got absolute morons in charge and both our populations are filled with idiots.  True that  But just a tiny bit of contrast   over here the liberal parties have lost sight of what they stand for while over in the US it  39 s the conservative.   So now we do care what actors think   these fools are stuggling to find anyone who agrees with them....  I kept thinking this said dollywood. lol.  Glad to see that bollywood isn  39 t as corrupted as Hollywood  Explain how companies make more money by having less users when they make money off of ads   If it s about money and greed  wouldn t it make more sense to NOT ban one of your most prolific users    Her opinion is important   s  Proof  Links  None.  Who cares what an actor thinks.  Why can  39 t I comment on any other post in this sub

She s having a TDS orgasmic meltdown.  For the love of God man  please don  39 t ever use the word orgasmic in sentence about pelosi. I wish my brain could get the clinton laptop treatment now.  Like with a cloth   Sorry    TDS be brutal tho..  She wants to diddle him and he laughed at her. That s why she tore up those pages  it was a love letter she wrote for Trump  Remember her tearing up the papers that Trump  39 s  speech was written on    She is crazy as a shithouse rat.   Looks like one too.  She probably wants to give him a spanking.  So where are the charges against her for attempting a military coup   Don  39 t think the 25th amendment route will fly. They will impeach though  and already have a couple republican senators  they  39 ll certainly push for more.  Those Republicans are just shooting themselves in the foot. Most Republican agree that violence is bad but they also agree that it  39 s not Trump  39 s fault. Saying that he incited the violence is complete bs.  Its also petty and not very strategic on their part either.  Take Romney for example  we know he very much dislikes Trump  but if he votes to impeach he  39 s pour fuel on the fire of party infighting  not a smart long term play even for his own prospects.  On the other he can just say   Their goal is to make it so he won  39 t even be able to run for a second term. Its total bs because all that does is take an option away from the American people. He should be able to run again and if he wins than that is the will of the people.  He  39 ll be 78 and come with a load of baggage.  The Dems would be salivating at him running again  even better if he could do it as a 3rd Party and split the vote.  No  this move is to try and smear all the people around Trump  incite a full on Republican civil war  and shore up Pelosi  39 s own left flank.  Its not actually about Trump.  Oh  yeah that makes more sense. I was just looking at the legal ramifications of this. Not the political fallout.  He s wrong  it s about disqualifying Trump  that s why the press is already talking about how all it would take is a majority to stop someone from running again.   Nope  Trump is the most formidable person in the Republican Party  and one of the few who can lead it into the future  past the corporate cronyism and elitism that has plagued it in recent years  shout out to Loeffler for trading on insider information ahead of the pandemic. Remember it s Trump s fault we lost those seats.   Romney knows his career is over  he does what he does now out of spite  even though the people he supposedly represents don t want it. Funny how the whole conservative movement  including myself sadly  held him as a pillar of virtue just 7 or 8 years ago.  Thanks for the useless paywall link.  Much appreciated.  s

If not for the controversy between then til Jan 6th their transition plans would ve looked natural. It just looks commie now because they are kicking it into overdrive now that the EC has been counted and nothing stands in the new administration s way. They are fitting two months into two weeks essentially.  Trump  39 s great turnout made their cheating more visible. they had to pull out all the stops to  quot beat him. quot   Their puppet has been dragging across the ground toward the finish line since election night.

I mean the  president elect  was already conversing with other world leaders and had already thrown BLM under the bus post election.

Not a lot of techies on the right and the ones that are will most likely be in hiding.  There  39 s a lot of installers and hardwire people. They should start installing remote switches and the minute these lefty techs start censoring  flip that switch and cut the power.  I m a techie on the right but the problem is it is hard to find like minded individuals who also have money.   AR15.com was the single largest repository for online firearms knowledge. Biden doesnt even need to ban online sales of guns and ammo  Hosting companies will just boot gun stores just because.  When you boot someone off like that  you should be required to answer why you didn  39 t give the slightest hint of a fuck about them being on your server for as long as they were prior to a bunch of tech lords  quot coincidentally quot  deplatforming them at the same time.  If they have some kind of moral objection to taking their money now  seems like they should refund all of it retroactively.  When Biden said that we had dark days ahead  he was right. He and his supporters are going to cause them.  Did they deplatform them because it s racist to buy and sell black guns   Good thing I only buy gold plated guns.  just sheer insanity  Guess I have some domains to move.  But why

Plenty more lawyers  Not Lin Wood again.  I guarantee there is a coalition of Peter Thiel style billionaires hiring the best lawyers in the country for this.  Probably starting with Randaza out of Vegas.  Republicans had six years to do something about big tech and did nothing.   a href   r news   r news  a  has been celebrating all day. They love it.  Those morons keep denying that this is censorship  completely forgetting that corporate censorship is a thing.  They only care when it happens to them.  They ONLY care about anything when it  39 s adverse for them  but cheer it when it  39 s to hurt who they  em perceive  em  as their enemy.  I mean to be fair  most  quot politics quot  is just rooting for your own team in america. Idiots on all sides  no one is immune.  You will find conservatives here criticise republicans. I challenge you to find the political mirror equivalent on the rest of reddit.  I like to browse many policial subreddits  if only to hear the opposition directly rather than paint a straw man of them .  a href   r Politics   r Politics  a  is pretty circle jerky when it comes to only criticizing the right  but smaller  more left leaning subs  especially for particular candidates  tend to criticize their centrist counterparts.   I think nearly everyone outside the big echo chambers can agree that neolibs and neocons are scum   a href   r stupidpol  r stupidpol  a  is the only lefty sub that I  39 ve come across which tends to  instead of attacking centrists  attack the insane behavior of those far left. Specifically attacking stuff regarding identity politics. You would almost think it was a right wing sub  even  If they cared about police brutality they would be outraged an unarmed woman got shot in the neck at the capital  with others dying as well. They care about victimhood and division  stroking their own egos  and feeling superior.  Remember when cops was bad  and government was racist  Now cops should be respected  and government is perfect  HOW DARE YOU PROTEST   Tools of the authoritarian state they now control.  Flippity flop   quot Actually  no  they have too much power. quot   But this IS their pathetic life. They have nothing else to do.  Funny that you have so many upvotes they can t downvote fast enough. I love it when leftards get triggered  Yep lol  they re insufferable. Though I do love when they try to reply to me and I m able to see it in my notifications  yet they re not actually under my comment. It s absolutely wonderful.  Why do you think that is  Do you think that the mods are censoring lib leftists   It s because of the  Flaired Users Only  flair under the post. If you aren t flaired  your comment gets deleted.  If they didn  39 t  this place would mirror  a href   r politics  r politics  a . They vastly outnumber us. They would try to take us over and you  39 d never see a conservative post because they would bury it with downvotes. Libs lefties LOVE censorship.  More accurately it s Sherman Act. They re shutting down one company customer  Parler  by claiming terms of service violation  while letting another  Twitter  violate those same terms. There is violent rhetoric on both sides. Planning and coordination of  protests  on both sides. You can t have one without the other. You can t say one is x and the other isn t.   I  39 m pretty sure Antifa used Facebook to coordinate their own terroristic riots. These people don  39 t care about consistency  they only care about silencing those they disagree with.  I know they  39 re active on Twitter based on all the death threats you can find in the replies to his tweets  Yeah but still I think in this particular case  they want us to think it  39 s about silencing us more than they just don  39 t want competition and this is a good excuse to snuff it out.  They care first and foremost about the stock price.  It s sad how they seem to not think social media companies and big tech wouldn t be operating in the exact same manner against left leaning groups if the incoming government was majority conservative and blamed their platforms for allowing a violent act on the capitol. Yes it s extra convenient for big tech because they do politically align with the left  but their first mission is to remain in their overwhelmingly powerful  monopoly  too big to fail status at all costs. Whenever there is the threat of possible legislation  actual updating anti trust competition law to be better in regards to the digital economy  etc they will do whatever they can to be seen as being on the right side of things.   They do not politically align with the left  only with themselves. If the right offered them new legislation that  39 d screw their competition harder than the left  39 s censorship and taxation  they  39 d be  quot right wing quot .  When have they been highly concerned about the amount of power massive corporations have over the public  Might be my Gen Z showing  but they ve been handing over their liberties on a platter to Big Daddy Megacorporations as long as I can remember  At the same time they are thinking they are anti establishment.  The  quot resistance quot .  They  39 re genuinely stupid enough that they don  39 t realize that their entire political party is made up of and relies on massive corporations.  They still think the Democrats are the party of the little guy  the average working class American.  Couldn  39 t be further from the truth.  The people running their party are a bunch of rich CEOs and politicians who  39 ve made a fortune through backdoor deals.  Because the TV told them to. Bunch of sheep. I question everything   even Trump.  Hope they win their anti trust lawsuit  BAKE THE CAKE BIGOT   Yep. They want to force companies to bake cakes for gay weddings  yet they  39 re totally okay with massive Big Tech companies denying service to people over political ideology.  I  39 m starting to lean toward forcing publicly traded companies to follow constitutional free speech principles.  Yeah  I  39 m not sure what the correct course of action should be  legally. But there  39 s clearly an issue. The first step to fixing a problem is identifying it. Ideally  I  39 d like for these companies to listen to the public outcry and choose to stop censoring on their own.  That ain  39 t gonna happen unless we can all agree to make it happen  unfortunately   removed    a href   r lotrmemes  r lotrmemes  a  has some posts about it but luckily there  39 s a no politics rule and the mods are good about removing them  I m a mod there. I ve been a tad inactive lately  but we got some pretty based lads on the team  and we definitely try to remove political shit when we see it.  It  39 s one of my favorite meme subs for that reason. I like my politics in my politics subs  not my meme subs. Keep up the good work. Love that place  Thanks mate. As a redditor I feel the same way for sure  that s definitely influenced how I moderate.  This is how democracy ends. With thunderous applause.  No better time has there been to speak this quote.   deleted   their mods probably do too  seeing as they perma ban conservatives for being conservative. it  39 s impressive how they manage to run their sub even worse than rpolitics.  It  39 s natural for authoritarians. They don  39 t care what happens or how many rights they lose as long as the authortarians crush their political rivals first. They could be told that they will be getting shot tomorrow and would happily agree with it if it meant they get to watch their enemies shot today.  I wish him luck but what can he do at this point  These Big Tech giants are way more powerful and influential. Parler by comparison is the ultimate underdog.  Unless I am mistaken  the ACLU are partisan hacks now.  they actually made a statement about how this kind of censorship is dangerous and could backfire and be used against POC.  We care about gay black people and we  39 re finally realizing that if this was a right wing tech company this wouldn  39 t be good so I guess we  39 re stuck supporting the bad guys for once  At the end of the day censorship hurts everyone  and the push towards true conservatism is good for all who cherish their individual rights.  Agreed. I  39 m only making fun at the pretzel logic that got them to this conclusion.   Pretzel logic  I m stealing that one haha  They  39 re pretty libertarian  but more left leaning beltway libertarians who align with democrats. They  39 re still pretty based on government free speech restriction and nat sec issues.  If Microsoft can be sued for stifling Netscape then then I don t see why Apple  Google and Amazon can t be sued for shutting down Parler. I haven t seen anything on Parler as bad as what I ve seen on Twitter.   It is protected by the same laws that Twitter and Facebook take advantage of. So naturally we get to watch the democrats strip away at 230 protections to get rid of parler  which will in turn put checks on Twitter and Facebook.  Two words  selective enforcement.  The neo leftist authoritarians running these tech companies   aka woke millennials and gen y ers  are so blinded by their self righteousness they re willing to annihilate anything that stands in their way. The Constitution  free speech  and the small businesses that are the backbone of this country.   removed   here  39 s hoping you  39 re right  but with everything I  39 ve seen from this spineless court  I don  39 t hold out hope.  Would they have standing in court  We honestly dont know these days  If Twitter can do anything because they are a private company then the rest of business can be open and do what they want  It  39 s less a  quot twitter can do what they want quot  and more of a  quot the government can  39 t tell companies how to regulate political speech under current law quot  issue. Corporations like Twitter can be regulated  but not in ways that infringe on their constitutional rights. The courts have ruled that shutting down businesses for legitimate public safety concerns is constitutional  although it  39 s up to the government to prove that there are legitimate public safety concerns  and that their actions aren  39 t discriminatory.  Bake the cake  right   They have no principles. Confirmation bias all the way.  Not a wise course of action   these corporations are behemoths and can afford to tie up Parler in law fare for years.  The problem is that if nobody DOES anything they ll do it again. And right here is a perfect moment to strike back against these assholes  sure they won t be hurt that much but still better than bending the ass to take another hit.  The federal government  whats left of it  would need to do it. These technology companies are in some ways more powerful than even them.  Parler is either turning itself into a martyr or it  39 s  David vs Goliath. What. Needs to be done is that a class action lawsuit needs to be filed. Fuck these tech fascists  first the government destroys thousands of businesses with lockdowns and now the beneficiaries of the lockdowns are destroying  their smaller competitors.  That was the point the entire time.  The tech companies are going to get the Jack Ma treatment from the government at some point. But it will be too late by then.  I don  39 t see what basis he has for lawsuit.  Amazon reserves the right to terminate for any reason  including none.  I don t think so either. I imagine Amazon would have a clause in their contract giving them the right to terminate the service if certain conditions are met. They d merely argue in court that they had been met and gave fair warning of the cancellation.   gt  If it  39 s a civil lawsuit and they can prove that Amazon targeted them for political reasons they could sue for damages.  They could do but do they have the money to do it  From what I ve read they re really up against it and it s not clear the site will return as many hosting companies don t want to host them.  Potentially antitrust  I mean the collusion between these companies meets the standards for anti trust. But from my understanding the Governmwnt would have to bring that to court  You realize the last major anti trust action to succeed was the blocking of Staples and OfficeMax merger because antitrust law was last updates decades ago and really pertains more towards brick and mortar and physical goods operations and is 100  not up to date to deal with modern antitrust issues in our digital economy.   In 2011  AT amp T tried to buy T Mobile. The US government went so far as to have the Antitrust Division of the DoJ file a lawsuit to block the merger  after which AT amp T abandoned the attempted acquisition. It was just in 2015 that the government also blocked a merger between Staples and Office Depot  who bought OfficeMax  because of antitrust concerns.  Microsoft was what I would consider the last  Major  one.  Antitrust   coordinating and colluding with other major business partners to shut down competition and enforce a monopoly on a communication platform like twitter.  Antitrust  Amazon is openly coordinating with Google  Apple  Facebook  Twitter  etc to take out competition  We can t give up and neither can Parler. There has to be a way. The technology with cryptocurrency and a decentralized service. Everyone who uses it has a piece of the database or just their own uploads.  With Dems in charge of everything in just a few weeks  the feds with shut down Parler  Gab  Rumble  basically anywhere that allows republican conservative chat or intermingling.  The solution is probably building their own web hosting service.  Maybe im an old  old  OldTimer.  But this all brings up memories of Radio Free Europe.  This is the correct answer  This. A business has the right to deny service based on their policies. They should find other servers services if they want to continue to operate  instead of wasting resources pretending thet can overcome what is very solid legal ground for tech services companies.  Idk why you all think this is a cut and dry issue with an obvious answer. Plus  I thought you all stood for small government and allowing corporations to choose who they do business with  I mean fuck  if you guys aren t then I m on the wrong subreddit. This subreddit is  a href   r Conservative  r Conservative  a  not  a href   r DonaldTrump  r DonaldTrump  a  or even  a href   r Republican  r Republican  a  .. have some god damn standards.  100   big tech can make it increasingly inconvenient to use alt tech  but they can  39 t stop it. you can compile your  a href  https   www.chromium.org   own version of chrome  a .  There was a thing a little while back where poland would fine social media platforms for political censorship  I mean  this is coordinated anticompetitive behavior.  That just screams antitrust.  And collusion in doing so  I just talked to a friend of mine who thinks there is absolutely nothing wrong with what big tech is doing. He also defended the riots all last year but is now saying the right is out of control. I am genuinely confused how people can support this stuff. What a time.  Political discourse is dead. Everyone is interested in dealing in confirmation bias and nothing else.  Ding ding ding you just described 99  of people actually invested in politics. I hate to play the  I m a centrist  card but god damn the level of hypocrisy I see every time a new hot topic pops up is crazy. You guys and  a href   r Politics  r Politics  a  keep flip flopping sides like it s no big deal.    Thing is no one wants to host them and  we can use the whole private companies can do what they want it s their business but they aren t applying their standards equally seeing how many of the riots were organized on said platforms  If that s the case then you should take your business elsewhere. If you can t cause of a lack of options then the issue lies with these big corporations being monopolies and not with the  censorship  itself.  So than how does one fight them when the government itself is in bed with them therefore preventing any action being taken  So your solution is to use the government.. who is  in bed  with these companies  to fight the companies  Oof.  I mean idk what you aim to accomplish anyways  politicians accept donations and are bought by big corporations. Democrat or Republican  you re not convincing any of them to go after their additional source of income.  Our government is corrupt  I would really love to download Parler  except for them forcing me to give them my telephone number. I  39 ll sit here in silence  with my privacy more intact.  Phone numbers used to be listed in a book that got delivered to every home in the county. This is your sticking point    That was before robocalls and automated identity theft. There are many people who have not adopted it for this reason.  Time to decentralize.  Redevelop to host on decentralized platforms.  Use the technology storj sia use.  They cannot shit down all of is.  Besides  a social media platform that doesn t spy on user activity is a threat to big tech  On what grounds  Our leftist tech overlords write the terms and conditions  Probably anti trust that Twitter directly worked with apple and Microsoft to de platform its leading competitor   deleted   The laws are still there  When have laws or the constitution stop a good liberal policy.  Strongest case that I haven  39 t heard anyone say yet is a tortious interference claim  Surely someone with money in America still has principles and cares about free speech.  when they block you at every turn it is hard  Companies like Apple et al have nearly infinite monies  and legions of lawyers  to fight this type of suit. I hope Parler prevail  but somehow I think they will go bankrupt before they even see the inside of a courtroom.  Has anyone seen proof of Parler being directly responsible for the storming of the Capitol  We keep seeing how they are a collection of hate groups gathering  yet I ve yet to see any posts indicating they engage in Nazism.  I  39 ve personally seen one dumb comment by lin wood and other than that I seen FAR more comments made on Twitter and Facebook about the stop steal the Parler.  Lin Wood has actually been banned from Parler.  Even then. I d still wanna see solid proof on those claims. Not calling you a Liar. There s just so much damn misinformation on this site.  Don  39 t have the link anymore.  Its been taken down too.  Figures. I ve noticed YouTube is also taking down numerous videos of politicians adding fuel to the fire as well.  of course not  There is no denying it was a coordinated attack on such a fast schedule as to prevent any chance of them stopping it.  I mean yes  but that argument wouldn  39 t hold up in a court  Yeah I  39 m sure a white guy who runs a free speech website is going to be treated 100  fairly by the legal system and win a major landmark case.  I feel bad for him. This is pissing me off way more than twitter banning people.  As long as he stays humble and open to free discussion on his platform he will be insanely wealthy in no time    Best of luck to them. The tech companies are so powerful and they have the government  aka The Party  on their side. I wish them the best.  It  39 s unbelievably hypocritical that Google  Twitter  and Facebook benefit so much from and fight so hard to preserve the legal protection from being held liable for what users post on their platforms and then turn around and pull this shit on their competitors. In what world could it be legal for them to act like this  It  39 s clear and objective anti trust violations. Google is a vertical monopoly and is abusing this to remain a horizontal monopoly. Time for some good old fashioned trust busting.  That should take...wait a minute  a decade  Big tech has censored and banned the actual President of the United fucking States of America.  Look I  39 m all for the rights of private companies to do as they please but when these companies grow to the size and scope of utilities  its changes the game a little.  What if the power companies could deny service to people they didn  39 t like    they can  39 t .  These huge media companies like Apple  Facebook  Twitter  Google  Etc...they function almost as utilities at this point and being unable to use them is a crazy blow to any company that relies on their services.  This whole thing is nuts.  What a shame. It  39 s astonishing how the Left celebrates censorship  what has this country come to    racketeering and anti trust hoooooooo  Excuse my pessimism but if the Supreme Court didn t do anything about the election then they definitely won t help Parler  Those are two very different situations. I agree with McConnell that overturning the election now would start the death spiral of the US. This though is different situation entirely. I  39 d be surprised of they didn  39 t weigh in on this in Parlor  39 s favor.  Is Gab seriously the only alternative to Parler

Silencing political opponents is their forte  It  39 s really a precarious position we find ourselves in and our friends on the left are blinded by their hatred of us on the right to recognize that what  39 s going on is not good.

Merkel gets it.  If Trump can be disappeared  anyone can. And  as  a href   u Sinner12180   u Sinner12180  a  said  Germans should have a special sensitivity for this.  It is problematic.  If  quot trumpism quot  and MAGA are what happen when one party or segment of a party feel disenfranchised  marginalized and demonized for a generation  further marginalization will only entrench them.    I hate the be like the other side  but there is literally no difference between the relationship American mega corporations have with the Democrats and the relationship German corporations had with the NSDAP. I suppose the US government isn  39 t supplying them with slave labor  although it is enabling the utilization of it overseas.  The real irony is that the merger of corporate power with political power  called corporatism  was at the core of fascism in Mussolini  39 s Italy. Of course leftist academics have now come up with a light and fluffy definition of fascism to just mean  quot people I don  39 t like quot .  Ok  as a German this is really a big surprise to see.

I believe they need 60 senators to impeach.  67.  The House impeaches with a bare majority  which they have. But the Senate can acquit Trump  with 33 votes  which they have with many to spare.   It  39 s just for show. Just like the last one. They know they have a snowball  39 s chance in hell of it going anywhere.  Soooo we can try and push this through in  a weeks time but we can t get Covid relief all fucking summer  I watched every second of the last impeachment. It was incredibly boring.

He has had his turn  and this is how it ends  No  someone else needs to take up the reins or we  39 re going to be swinging between Obama style politics and Trump style politics for a long time to come.  They also want vengeance for the last 4 years.  Crazy seeing as they don  39 t realize that shitshow on the 6th was people fired the fuck up over what they pulled over the past 4 years.  Those blinded by hate only see what they wish to see.  It  39 s a problem as old as man.  Nah.  That would be the greatest gift they could receive.  He  39 d never win the primary but he would torch everyone else on the stage.  Or else run as a Ross Perot third party candidate and hand the election to rival nominee Ilhan Omar  D   Al Shabab .   and hand the election to rival nominee Ilhan Omar  D Al Shabab     If Trump was actually planning an insurrection  things would have went much differently.  Any of these people calling the ruckus on the 6th a   39 failed coup d  39 etat  39  have literally no fucking clue how a coup works.  They  39 ve never been to countries with actual coups  if anything their push for impeachment is more coup like than anything.  What flavor ice cream though because we know those are the important questions for the left   quot A double scoop of Prune  with Bran sprinkles  quot   So much unity. I love it. This will really bring the country together   United on the path to Hell.  Amazing the mental gymnastics they go through.  Two things have I to say about this.  Firstly  he told the protestors to peacefully disperse when they got too rowdy  but video evidence of this fact keeps getting taken down.  Therefore the charges of insurrection are completely bogus.  Secondly  while I would like Trump to assume a second term  I grow more disturbed by Republicans exhibiting increasingly cult like behavior towards the man.  When you treat a single man as some sort of savior  nothing but trouble will follow. There is much that I appreciate about his last four years of office  including the reinvigoration of the conservative base  but it will become necessary for that torch to be passed to others.  I agree. The torch will be passed after his second term is served  whether that s 2021 2025 or 2025 2029.  Yep. Trump is not done yet that s the thing. Referencing the word cult is a debasing and derogatory statement straight from the lefts playbook. What s disturbing to me is that republicans are calling other republicans cult followers ....  I  39 m not a Republican though.  I vote for Republicans  and occasionally for Libertarians  but I never have felt comfortable registering as one because I have a problem with the two party system.  Also  the party has a lot of warmongers  and I have a severe problem with that. Otherwise my views tend to line up with theirs enough that I vote for them.  I  39 m an independent conservative.  I used the word  quot cult like quot  because it  39 s accurate.  There are Republicans who treat Trump like he  39 s some sort of messiah figure  and that  39 s really concerning to me.  I generally like his policies  and I had hoped that he would get elected instead of the incoming scumbag  but the conservative movement cannot place its hope in one man.  To do so is foolishness at best.  If anything  we need principled men in power who are not elderly.  Right now we need unity and one man who provides a symbol can help accomplish that  totally agree with your points but at the end of the day there are crazies in all walks of life and to single out tump supporters for  cult like  behaviors is a useless gesture. There will never be a candidate anywhere without people like this that follow them. All this tells me is that the socialist propaganda machine has influenced the thinking of many people even on the opposite side of the fence...  Believe what you want. I try to observe everything through as critical of a lens as I can  and I  39 ve been observing the Republicans especially over the last 4 years.  There is no propaganda at play here.  I made my comment due to the behavior I have witnessed  not because of someone else  39 s talking points.  Could you describe your concerns without invoking any lefty buzzwords  Lets shift away from cult entirely   is there another way to frame the issue you perceive   I deny the premise that it  39 s a  quot lefty buzzword quot   but I will indulge you.  My concern is that many Republicans are placing excessive faith in Trump to fix everything that  39 s wrong with the system  sometimes even to the point of laws and procedures be damned.  I  39 ve witnessed people online and in person that say we should elect other members of his family after he serves two terms  or that he should run again after sitting out a term. I intrinsically distrust people who fawn over those in power.  Does that help   There was nothing to help my friend  I simply offered you an opportunity to clarify your position. It seems that the main issue is that extreme trump supporters are seemingly willing to violate law and order to get what they feel is right. Do you share the same concern for Biden supporters  In general they re quite a bit more radicalized. Or is this less of an issue since you do not vote blue anyway   Anyone who currently votes Blue concerns me to some degree  and with the extreme ones it  39 s far beyond simple concern. That  39 s a separate issue. But my concern with a lot of Trump supporters  and I am a Trump supporter  is not only those who are willing to violate the law.  My concern is that their trust is in a man instead of deeds.  Wait I thought the Dems already impeached him already   Guess that didn t work out as they hoped.  Trump 24   Trump will be president in 2024. And 2021  2022  2023.  I mean let s be realistic...he s not going to be kept in office at the end of this month  no matter how bad we all want that.  I don t understand how some of us to get that already  the legal battles played out and we couldn t gather the evidence needed to build a cased. Sworn statements can only go so far. Time to accept the shit show that will be the next 2 4 years and build a better party that can combine classic conservatism with modern society .  I m hoping Trump works on his public image over 4 years and comes back with a vengeance   quot Everything from the left is projection. quot    Mark Dice  2020.  Imagine accusing a sitting president of trying to overthrow his own government.

t3_kukm7q,Marriott Blue Cross Blue Shield and Commerce Bancshare stop donations to all 147 Republicans who opposed Certifying Biden as President Ford Bank of America CVS Target ATampT Berkshire Hathaway and Exxon Mobil are also considering similar policies,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kukm7q/marriott_blue_cross_blue_shield_and_commerce/,Everyone stop donating to politicians   Politicians should have real jobs and not need to be bought and paid for by the highest bidder  Well that  39 s true too.  Not sure if it would help us  but Singapore pays their politicians a lot of money to try and deter corruption. Over  1M USD at the top.  Yeah right they should get  50k a year and free bologna sandwiches for lunch. If they dont like it don  39 t be a  quot public servant quot .  All that would do is give pukeosi an additional 800K year.  And an effective auditing system to fix the billions of waste abuse....  Amen  And awoman    I believe the state they represent should provide quarters  a stipend  and a small expense account to maintain themselves in DC and while on business.   How about predominantly centrally funding campaigns with low caps on donations and much stricter campaign finance laws   They don  39 t care about donations either way  all that would do is give them more money in addition to what they get from lobbyists and special interest groups.  Donations should be only allowed from registered voters  and no  quot bundling quot .  And you must remember ultimately it all goes to the Media to pay for all that air time.  Democrat  Republican it doesn  39 t matter it all goes to the Media.  You do realize that the money doesn  39 t go directly to the politician to use as he pleases  right  It goes to their campaign or related organizations.  Ask Omar how that  39 s going. She can  39 t take the money  but she sure as shit can funnel millions to her husband.  They ll donate again later when the heat is off.  Nice flair  Also tons of Dems did same thing in Bush years. There acting like this is new. Double standards again. Thinking Antifa might be right....this country is fucked anyways.  Is this supposed to be good PR for these assholes  Reminding people that our political system is run by lobbyists like them   This was my first thought as well. I m almost 100  sure that the majority of people were unaware that these companies donated directly toward politicians in the first place. All they did was highlight how much of our government is owned by private corporations.  I didn t have much hope for the majority of our voter base anyway. Apparently  millions of people voted for a racist  possible rapist  establishment politician  who has had a less than mediocre nearly 50 year political career  and who very likely has dementia.  And has been proven to be corrupt 100   You guys forgot blatantly racist.  Somebody said on a different post that these companies know conservatives don  39 t take things personal or something to that effect. So they have nothing to worry about shitting all over conservatives.   The most frustrating thing in the world is trying to get my conservative friends to wake up.   quot Oh they are coming after us  Huh  shrugs shoulder  I don  39 t have Facebook anyway so when is the game on Sunday  quot   Im keeping tabs on all these companies. They  39 ll never see a red cent from my family again. Already deleted accounts and sold stock  will gladly keep going. Bitcoin is going through the roof anyway  Oh no  This   74 million people voted for Trump. That can make a huge impact financially.  We need to make it impactful by not using these companies. Bank of America is anti gun anyways and I won  39 t bank with them. I haven  39 t bought ExxonMobil gas since the the Valdise incident when their drunk captain ran their oil tanker aground. Going forward I won  39 t be visiting any Marriott hotels and so on. There are so many alternatives in the market place people can easily change their buying habits without any affect to their lives. But if enough of us do it there will be an impact to these companies.  They aren  39 t afraid of our impact.  The amount of frenzied virtue signaling is incredible.  I  39 m so disturbed by this woke capitalism. It  39 s kind of freaky seeing all these corporations virtue signal in some desperate attempt to get some more brand recognition. You gotta think that it  39 s gonna backfire  right  Or have they realized that half the country is enough to sustain their businesses   It  39 s the cool thing to do. In a few months when everyone forgets they  39 ll go back to their quid pro Joe deals.   But think of the woke points    This wouldn  39 t even be news or an issue if corporations couldn  39 t make political contributions in the first place.  I agree we need a separation of corporations and state far more than church and state and for the same reasons.  Well the good news is that the  quot two party system quot  won  39 t be an issue any more.  The irony here is these dimwits in the GOP fought to give massive tax breaks to all these corporations. They even made sure the democrats can t pass any single payer healthcare system that will hurt insurance companies like Blue Cross Blue Shields. And now these same companies are going to cut off republicans and fund democrat politicians.  Don  39 t worry. The Democrats will be all too happy to take those bribes   I mean campaign contributions to carve out tax exceptions for those companies  Spot on.  it  39 s already a one party system.   if these organizations were donating to these politicians  then that means they had special interest. Now all these politicians have to do is basically ignore their special interests  and actually just work against them  Lol.  Biden said so himself that he  39 s gonna kill the fossil fuel industry.  Oh cool  blue cross  the only provider in FL and the cheapest coverage I could get was like  700 a month....lawl.  See  their bribes  err   quot donations quot  worked fine for them.  What the actual fuck  that was after your employer paid their part   Good. Stop donating. Period.  Good. The GOP should fully embrace the working class.  Shapiro predicted we d end up with this kind of segregation capitalism but I didn t think it would happen so fast.  Were literally  10 days into bidens presidency and this shit is happening.  You haven t seen a thing yet. They aren t even in power yet. The amount of moves on day one will be shocking.  This is how democracy dies.  And with applause  no less.  expect alot more   these companies outing themselves  But Republicans are the party of the elite  rich and corporate world     Wow so billion dollar corporations arent supporting Republicans and are in lock step with the Democrats  I thought the Democratic party was for the working people     Neither party is. Only one person in DC is and that s President Trump and they re trying to remove him.  Damn right.  Imagine being a leftist and seeing this.    They are boycotting people who are poorly representing their interests. I don  39 t get why this thread thinks this is a bad look for Dems. No where does this article point to anything depicting that. It is just ragging on the idiots who still insist the election was  quot stolen quot .  The Republicans under corporate financial threat should wear this  loss  of corporate support as a badge of honor and make it a central campaign issue.  Boycott these fuckers. Someone should create an app with GPS capabilities that notifies you when you are about to patronize a woke business. They are already spying on me and tracking my every move I might as well get a warning when I  39 m about to get fucked.  That  39 s a good idea for an app and definitely feasible. Just don  39 t host the database of  quot woke quot  companies on AWS  Amazon   Azure  Microsoft   or GCP  Google .  All the  app would need is a feature allowing the user the ability to highlight certain businesses that meet certain criteria. Boycott lists could be completely separate from the app itself. It could be useful for leftists looking to boycott whoever they want as well. At this point I don  39 t really care. This game they are playing should offer both sides mutually assured destruction  maybe they will pull their heads out of their asses if everyone starts to take a hit. As they say  two can play at this game. The problem is  we need the tools to play since we don  39 t have all of the tech and news companies on our side.  Calculate the   39 woke coefficient  39  and inform people exactly which businesses contribute most to leftist causes.  This needs done now.  Yep. If you cancel us we cancel you.  Agreed but it ll get pulled off the stores ASAP  Don t these companies have fiduciary responsibility that precludes them from alienating a good percentage of their customers   The corporate economy has become an oligopoly  it s no longer capitalist. They don t have to answer to us anymore.  At some level the problem becomes who gets newly issued money... the elite businesses get new money  first so thats one reason we can  39 t stop them.  So we may have to visit how much the monetary system enables their stablility  Damn right.   We don  39 t have to use stupid old Twitter.  yes  go ahead and take it to court and try your hand at getting a social justice warrior for a judge. 2020 has made me more cynical than I ever thought I could be   em 2021 enters the chat  em   This. There is no more law. There is only power  influence  and force.  Fax  You could use that same argument to say that making donation to these politicians alienates their liberal customers. But in actuality no  corporations have no obligation to make political donations.  They probably found it was less costly than continuing to support them or are trying to profit from the free press. I doubt they have any actual morals.  One would think so  I ve seen people say  the people spoke  and the invisible hand moved their business to what the people wanted    deleted   I forget  which side is the fascists   Obviously us because we like personal liberty  Frankly  I think this makes those politicians more attractive candidates to me. I mean ... you mean to tell me some of these candidates might not be bankrolled by mega corporations and thus have relative free will and might have to listen to individual voters more and I m supposed to be less interested in voting for them  Frankly being it on  I ll at least have to consider donating to every single one who represents me. If I m on that list  I do everything I can to get on national tv and declare that I ll no longer be taking corporate donations and that I m expanding my local office hours to aid me in reconnecting with real people. I m making this a political feature and then shaming corporations every chance I get about how they use their money to subvert the republic. I m calling for hearings about reforming campaign finance by specifically excluding donations over 100 bucks by any one person. I mean  I m running wild with this and making as much noise as possible that I am no longer a corporate shill. See how long the corporations take to come crawling back with double their prior donations once that gets rolling.  we will still need leader after what going to happen.  And the fascist relationship between politically connected crony corporations and Democrats is exposed to the world. Well it already was but  yeah. This is the swamp. Most Republicans who aren  39 t on this list are part of the nwo global elite club as well.          To be fair this is the business move. If you can get banned from the internet for supporting republicans  and donations are public  Ford can  39 t risk donating to a conservative if it means Twitter will derank all their content and AWS is going to knock their servers offline. We need to break up some of the biggest tech  Google Apple  and build our own services to fulfill the rest.  There  39 s a Marriott I  39 ve been staying at about every third week for the last six months.  There are usually about 6 10 cars in the lot.  The manager told me  quot I think you are singlehandedly keeping us open quot  and they always upgrade me to a suite.  I  39 ll be letting them know tomorrow that I  39 ll no longer be staying there  and why.  And republicans are the fascists  I m so sick of all of this ridiculous hypocrisy. Soon you ll be thrown in jail if you aren t a full blown liberal. Great   I call bottom bunk   This will just end up dividing the country even further  raising tensions and hostility even further. We are eventually going to reach a breaking point and at this rate it may happen soon.  divide and conquer   a standard tactic of the ruthless  Here the left is all up in arms over an  attempted coup  last week and doesn t care about this. Make no mistake  this is a partnership between big companies and the left to destroy any rights you still have. It s getting scary.  Businesses shouldn t be allowed to donate to politicians anyway lol...  Well thanks for letting us know that you actively bribe politicians  It s easy to forget how often these companies do that  Hey Marriott  Blue Cross Blue Shield and Commerce Bancshare... thanks for letting us know which companies to permanently boycott. This financial tactic works both ways. I  39 ll never stay in a Marriott owned hotel again.  I don t even know what commerce bancshare is  This is the beginning of the end. Things in this country are about to get very strange.  Good  We need change in our government structure. Politicians need to represent the people and STOP being puppets controlled by corporations  And we need to implement term limits to the Senate and the House  Let them stop the donations and let it happen to the left when their time comes     Nothing is going to happen until conservatives do something and accept things are going to be different    This should be really a kick to the nuts for liberals. They should realize that their actions are Aligned with lobbyists and that should scare them. Their ideals should be for the people and companies should hate that. The fact that these companies are going to double up on lobbying to dems....   Democrats are the party of the elites now. Republicans are working class people.  Republicans HAVE to rebrand that way. There s no other choice.   We should be the individual liberty party but then we are weighed down by the religious right that isn  39 t a big fan of freedom and who want to tell people that they have to follow the rules of their book.  Agreed. Nothing wrong with religion as long as everyone understands its a personal matter. Its not meant to be used as a set of laws to govern the country.  I understand that but most of the most active young liberals I see tend to work minimum wage jobs. They re problem is going to be that they re going to start to feel alienated as they continually see corruption hit their leaders and watch the progressive aspect of the Democrats disappear  And thats why this kind of news isn  39 t going to get much coverage  and banned as   39 hate speech  39  and   39 incitement  39  and   39 misinformation  39  on social media  to make sure they  em don  39 t  em  hear about it.  Cancel my health insurance and find a new bank.  Just make your own   Wow  democrats and their corporate minions are really exercising their   39 unity  39  plan of CCP comrade Biden.  Lol they  39 re telling the world  quot we pick the winners quot  glorious  Ive already sold stock off from amazon  ill stop doing business with any company that decides their opinions are the only ones that matter. Parallel economy here we come   Lmao.  A bit short cited  no   What happens when the libs are voted out   Nothing happens. They aren  39 t going to be consistent with this  they are only going to target the right.  I think they know that they can keep stealing elections.  Nothing happened this time and it was rampant.  They will only keep changing laws to make it easier for them to commit voter fraud.  Seemed to happen in the GA senate elections too. They  39 ve got a successful process and no one stopped or punished them. I don  39 t think we  39 ll see a republican government for a long time.  Omg evil corporations will not donate to us  gasp   Ita almost as if the media and corporations are all in on it  Companies to not buy from o well.  Why yes  I see you  39 ve done your job and obeyed your oath and therefor your loosing our donations. Sorry but not sorry  They re sending a message. If you aren t in their little club  you cannot play their game  and anyone who tries to let them can t play either.  All this means to me is that Republicans are about to take less corporate money than the Democrats. According to  a href   r politics  rel  nofollow  r politics  a  that means the GOP is less corrupt.  Pay to play in effect  Keep scratching them off. Don  39 t like Marriott anyway  dropped Anthem and will gladly not buy Ford  39 s anymore  BoA is shit anyway. Don  39 t like CVS. Mom  amp  Pop shops  fuck Target. Verizon is better than AT amp T anyway. Don  39 t use anyting from Berkshire Hathaway that I know of and Exxon Mobil gas stations are all trash anyway. Do these fucking people realize they are shutting out HALF of the United States   Lol Biden isn  39 t my president

I mean it was still pretty left but the  quot woke quot  culture was still laughed at. Now it is worshiped and self righteousness is a virtue.  Lol let s see libertarians defend this now.  I get it they re a corporation but Silicon Valley is now Wall Street west  and has way too much power over the people   Oh and then it s  make your own Twitter  and they take down Parler.  So yes government regulation is needed for this.  Once they re done with us they ll easily take down libertarians and even normal democrats  When I think of Ron Paul I think of that cool uncle that would buy you beer when you were 20.   All these government mandates over age  it s all so silly. Miller High Life    I remember when it was just  Give me a Miller or Give me a Lite and they knew what it meant.

They  39 ve been paying Trump lip service all this time  but they  39 ve been holding their noses while doing so.  They simply cannot wait to return to overtly lining their pockets with establishment politics.  Time to rehydrate the Tea Party and primary some of those bastards.  Rehydrate yes  and start  concurrently  in the schools.  To further preach their liberal agenda.  Won  39 t stop until they are out numbered by sane people on the school boards.  It ll never happen. It s only gonna be pushed further left. My personal opinion is parents will homeschool  send their kids to private schools to get away from the bullshit. I went to public school and thank god my parents saw what had been happening and had talks with us and other parents.  This shits been going on for a long time. Atleast 20 30  years. We re seeing it starting to take full effect now.  Then we need a majority home schooling.  I think rehydrate the Tea Party make it part of the MAGA party and end every RINOs career.

The stupid part of this is that you are going to drive reasonable Republicans Conservatives into the echo chambers of the lunatics which will radicalized even more of them.

Q  39 ists are a blight on the movement. They  39 ve wrapped their entire identities around a secret and nefarious being who feeds them a daily dose of bullshit without an iota of proof. Even Q  39 s first drop was fiction. The phraseology  the lexicon  all of it has been adopted by these poor dopes and it just tarnishes the entirety of what it means to be a conservative. There is no Q  there never was. The sooner people understand that the better of they will be. But oh no  if you even say it  you  39 re a shill. For whom  Who fucking knows. It  39 s just an easy dismissal for them to spout.  There is a Q. He  39 s a pig farmer named Jim Watkins living in the Philippines.  Qtards are not conservative  I  39 m sorry. Their beliefs do not reside within what is normally called the political spectrum.  What ever ideology they claim to have they are hijacking it for their own gain and purpose. These people need to be ostracized from society  I know some Q people sadly. They honestly believed Jan 6 was  the storm  or whatever. Trump would never denounce Q because he was the hero in that conspiracy.   They  39 ve been saying  quot The storm quot  was imminent for the last 3 years. A friend of mine is into Q and back in 2017 she put  quot RED quot  next to October on her calendar on her fridge because something  em huge  em  was supposed to happen. To this day she simultaneously admits Q has gotten some things wrong while saying every prediction he has made has come true 100 . Her excuse is that sometimes he intentionally throws misinformation out there to throw off the deep state.  Q seems to have a lot in common with  quot end times quot  obsessed evangelicals. They just don  39 t realize that by focusing on being a proper Christian you don  39 t need to obsess over the end times.  Jehovah  39 s Witnesses are actually one of the successors of Millerism alongside Seventh Day Adventists  and being exposed to both worlds  I see almost nothing but similarities. Living your life that way is rough to say the least. Just constant anxiety every time you wake up in the morning wondering if today is going to be  quot it. quot  When I left the JWs  letting go of that mindset was one of the greatest feelings.  Compares to Jehovah  39 s Witnesses   7th Day Adventists are sparkling water.  They have their  quot rules quot  but if you wanna eat meat  they  39 re supposed to be vegetarians  you can eat meat.  If you work on the Sabbath  where seventh day comes from   some may flip one shit but they won  39 t get kicked out or denounced.  They run huge healthcare organizations and obviously many work on the Sabbath.  They  39 re not supposed to drink caffeine but many guzzle coffee like the rest of us.  They  39 re not supposed to drink alcohol  but many of them are at the quickie Mart buying a 7 Eleven before football games fire up on a Sunday.    You d think they d get exhausted.  I wish Trump denounced Qtard shit when it started.  Denounce a group that sees him as some sort of literal savior   There  39 s no way his ego would allow that.  He s the hero of their world  he would never denounce it  And even if he did they  39 d contort themselves into knots to explain how he really is signaling support.  Are you kidding  Trump is a narcissist and this is literally a cult that he is the central figure of. Trump is not going to turn down worshippers no matter how crazy they are.  It s probably an ego thing or trump doesn t care enough to do anything about it.  Same  Even if he did you think they would care   same. He probably didn  39 t...cause votes. which I can understand. But he should have denounced them anyways.  IIRC they asked him to denounce it at a debate townhall and he didn  39 t even know what it was.  I don  39 t know much about them  but from everything I hear they  39 re just but job conspiracy people with Republican flavor. We don  39 t need that crazy.  Yeah  I  39 ve checked out several Q threads before to see what it is that these idiots talk about and it  39 s incredible.  They are nutjobs without a doubt but let them have their ideas and have their talks among each other. They are fine there.  They can talk amongst themselves  that  39 s fine. When they show up to a peaceful protest and make it a CNN  quot Peaceful Protest quot ... they have crossed the line and need to be shut down. Conservatives already have a hard time looking civil in the media  we don  39 t need radicals making it even more difficult.  I know a dude who got pretty heavily into the Q stuff. He was saying all this crazy shit like  Trump losing was all planned  just wait . And acting like Pence was going to be arrested for Treason. It s batshit crazy . The really sad thing is that he seems to have finally woken up to the fact that Biden is our president. Rather than question the crap that he s been fed for months  he is doubling down and saying that there is more corruption than they believed.  If a QAnoner makes it into heaven  and God himself told him that Q isn  39 t real  the QAnoner would just say  quot the conspiracy goes higher than I thought  quot   My mother in law is in deep. Sharing stuff with the family. The latest is that Trump will still be President  he never said Biden in his concession speech  and the next admin will be him and someone other than Pence.   My mom is a Jehovah  39 s Witness and my best friend is a QAnoner. It  39 s actually kind of scary how similar their warning texts to me are. What  39 s crazy is my best friend and I used to  em be  em  Jehovah  39 s Witnesses. We grew up being afraid of doomsday every day of our lives. When George H. W. Bush said  quot peace and security quot  during a state of the union address 30 years ago  my dad was jumping up and down on the couch like Tom Cruise yelling about the book of Revelation being fulfilled. One of the greatest things in my life was being free of that mindset. But I guess she  39 s just dependent on it and has to believe in doomsday no matter what the source is.  But your credit cards can cancel you if you support Trump.  Yeah maybe if Republicans weren t such weak fucks people wouldn t need the hopium of Q bullshit. Ryan and Mitch did nothing. They had no plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. Exactly what Conservative legislature did they get passed  Jack and shit.  My wife s cousin is big Q believer and keeps sending me messages about how  Marshall law  is coming. It s been coming since Nov. 4th apparently.   deleted   Think of Q as the place where the strangest and most outlandish conspiracies come from. Usually they will start with a fact and then run with it until the conclusion is   39 aliens or satan  39  ect..  Wait lol I didn  39 t know the gay frogs thing was actually based on something  It s called Atrazine. They weren t dumping it into a river. It is in our tap water. It s a pesticide that ends up making its way into tap water in small quantity. Some areas of the US have it a lot more than others. A scientist experiments with frogs and atrazine and finds out that the frogs turn hermaphroditic over time when exposed. This scientist was then fired and shunned by big pharma when he published his findings. The experiment was never recreated. I wonder why  It reminds me of taking several puzzles that were cut with the same dye and mixing them together.   I heard him on coast to coast am try to convince a gay guy they were poisoned from the water  the guys nuts.  Yep. I don t know anyone that is even remotely into q anon BS.  I actually have some of my mother s friends buying into 5g vaccine conspiracy nonsense.  The other day I saw someone post a conspiracy where they had the supposed  quot schematics quot  of the 5G vaccine chip.  Yeah I can see some aspects of whatever Q anon says getting out to normal people and them believing it. As far as full on q anon conspiracy theorists I think they are much more uncommon.  I sorta sympathize here. We  39 re so reliant on technology we  39 ve basically given up our freedom. I  39 m increasingly using a Tor browser  covering my webcam  and paying in cash  Yeah most of the stuff people are writing as tied to Q falls into the category of  random opinion  or  not left wing opinion.   Is Q another phrase that is going to lose meaning because of imprecise use  Me neither.  Same.  The Trumpian wing of the party needs to be expelled ASAP. A potato sack with an R on it could have beaten Hillary  would probably have beaten Biden  and absolutely would have had more Republican Senators elected in 2020.  Trump got people because he was the only politician talking about the things that actually mattered to them in decades. Most people  if you got them in a room by themselves  don  39 t  em really  em  give that much of a fuck whether other people have abortions or whether we have this foreign policy or that foreign policy. Most people want a good  stable job that keeps a roof over their head  food on the table  and allows them to save up enough to have fun every once in a while. Anything beyond that  most people  em really  em  don  39 t care all that much. Trump hit them on the issues that affect what they care about. He straight up told them  quot I am going to fight so you can have a good job  feed your family  and have some fun sometimes. quot  Did he deliver on that  Maybe. A lot of plants he visited claiming he was going to save all their jobs  Carrier in Indiana for one  ended up outsourcing and moving out of country anyway  but I  39 m sure someone could bring up some new plant that opened somewhere else and created jobs  so I don  39 t really know. Point is  he talked about what people cared about.   Remember when Chris Christie destroyed Marco Rubio  39 s chance at ever being President or anything other than just another politician  I do and it was funny.  I  39 m not a Chris Christie fan and I don  39 t care what your ideology is  but that was funny as fuck. Rubio just sat there and  em kept being a robot  em   spewing the same prepared speech  proving Christie  39 s point over and over again. It  39 s like he literally short circuited up on stage.  Let us dispel with this fiction that Marco Rubio doesn  39 t know what he  39 s doing  he knows exactly what he  39 s doing  Like remodeling his house on his government issued credit card   I mean  I don t disagree with him  the Q anon people are crazy  but I don t know anybody who actually a scribes to that. Obviously there are cute on people  but I don t know where or who they are  because I ve never met a conservative who actually is into the Q anon stuff  I ve only met one  and it was clear once you started talking to them that they bought into really weird conspiracies.  Unfortunately  many in my family are  quot Q anon people. quot  It  39 s very frustrating trying to talk with them  as you can imagine.  Rubio is right in this instance. But just to be clear  we need to be careful with this guy. He has about a Mitt Romney chance of winning in any general election.  I m a conservative. My family is mostly conservative. I have plenty of conservative friends  although way more liberal friends .   I don  39 t know one either but people did elect Marjorie Taylor Greene.  I still don t even know what qnon is  For some reason liberals get mad when you say this.  It s bizarre.  They started using the term and then expect everyone to know what it is  I don  39 t even know what Q is lol  Same here  I  39 ve tried to learn just to satisfy my curiosity  but a lot of the info is banned from the Internet.   From what I have heard  it was started by some guy named Q on 4chan who made random BS drops. Like he said Hillary  Obama  and the Deepstate would be arrested.   I  39 m sure the majority of regular every day conservatives already think these small extreme groups are morons. The things people are pissed off at are liberals double standards  the lefts take over of social media as a tool of propaganda. They can demonize conservatives at a constant and falsely make us out as monster via twisting things in the news  cherry picking  completing making things up or taking things out of context. Then they won  39 t report anything bad the left does and cover for them. There is a different set of rules regarding how a liberal vs conservative will be treated by social media and the news. Now they are openly removing conservative platforms while keeping liberal ones that call for violence and hate daily. Liberals can do horrible things with no consequences if conservatives even slightly break the rules the hammer comes down hard. You can see how bad things are if you just Google Gab or Parler  they on wiki come up listed as a place for the far right to gather  nazis  white supremacists and things like that. When if you actually participate in those social platforms you know even if that stuff is there they aren  39 t making up the majority and no one likes them most people there are regular conservatives. Yet those on the extreme left can spit out racism daily against those whom are white  they can call for violence to those they don  39 t like  they can praise the death of conservatives  they can praise the riots that occurred on their side  and all kinds of horrible and vile things. There are serious problems right now and things are not going to get better.  He  39 s right  but he is a bit of a tard too.  What does it matter  when it counts  you don  39 t stand for conservatives either. You drop to your knees like a cheap Detroit dime store Hooker whenever your job is on the line.
t3_kurc7f,Let us pause to remember when nearly 5000000 people signed a petition to overturn the election in 2016,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kurc7f/let_us_pause_to_remember_when_nearly_5000000/,Who cares about a petition though  I m still wondering why Russia helped Trump win in 2016 but not in 2020.   Maybe Russia did help trump but China helped Biden therefore proving that China is better than Russia  s  It seems very clear to me that China is aiding Biden because Trump imposed heavy trade wars with China.  The idea that a foreign nations would try to influence an election that could benefit them makes total sense. There are alot of false narratives and blanket statements going on. But if Russia sees Trump as someone who will lift trade constraints etc. then they should try to  quot infiltrate quot  our news social media  free news  Ads etc. To try and convince American people that Trump is the best option to vote. And likewise for China and honestly every country that has a stake in America. So each political party should be audited constantly for collaboration before being elected with foreign agents. This becomes hard for me personally because if you are already in a seat of politics like senate house governor president I feel like you should be communicating with foreign agents as applicable which causes the grey line to appear for what should be allowed. Those are my two cents to try to dispel single hate towards anyone  to know that it is done on both fronts and how I view it.  Too busy with COVID this year.  s   deleted   No  it can t be. You couldn t possibly be saying that  that... it was a hoax peddled by the Left    You really think they d do that  Get in front of the nation and lie like that     em laughs in garage door handle and 2am Subway sandwiches  em   I don  39 t even know what this means or how to mod it.  It was a reference to two obviously fake hate crime hoaxes the media peddled. The garage door handle was what Bubba Wallace referred to as a noose that was left for him. Subway at 2am was a reference to Jussie Smollett  39 s fake attack. The media spent a significant amount of time on these stories despite how suspicious they were.  Isn t the reason that we know they were fake because the media did their due diligence on seeking out answers clarification  though   All in the name of getting power  Not even for public safety  This cant be true   removed    removed   We should prioritize both RU and CN interference at the highest level  frankly.  Shame the Trump admin refused to do that out of fear of it delegitimizing their electoral win then.  It  39 s pretty clear that our own social media companies don  39 t need any foreign help to interfere with elections.   a href  https   www.intelligence.senate.gov sites default files documents Report Volume1.pdf  https   www.intelligence.senate.gov sites default files documents Report Volume1.pdf  a   Dont expect anyone to read official government reports that dissolve their alternate reality.   em gasp   em   Are we in conservative or conspiracy theories... lol  Can  39 t tell if people are being sarcastic  .  Or... and follow me on this one... they knew you absolute morons would attack democracy if he lost this election and their goal is a weakening of America. Moron labe  There s actually many possible reasons for that. If they thought trump would be a valuable ally in 2016 but by election season 2020 it turned out he didn t advance Putin s causes as much as was expected  which he certainly didn t   then the Russians would be less apt to interference and ad posting. Likewise is the idea that Putin is a fairly raging misogynist and that his hatred of Hillary specifically led to a lot of interference and her lack of presence turned him away from American politics. He may just have not seen a need or was expecting results favorable  He wanted Donald in office because of the specific chaotic effect it would have on american politics. Russia benefits from A  our withdrawal from worldwide soft power and B  America becoming seen as an unreliable ally.    yes the chaotic effect of a trump win  or the chaotic effect of interfering in general was also a key aim of Putin and Russia  Pretty much this. Remember than Putin not only wanted Trump to win  and helped him to achieve this  but he also wanted Sanders to win at the same time. The reason is obvious  because he knew those two candidates  being to the extremes of each other and the average citizen in general  would sew the most division.  Do you really think Russia  39 s goal was to get Trump elected  Their goal was to weaken the US by sowing division  among the domestic population and between America and her allies  and fomenting chaos. Trump was merely the opportunity that came along for them to do that.   removed   There should be  a href  https   www.politico.com news 2020 11 17 intel community foreign interference 2020 election 437094  an overview   a  from the intelligence community coming out soon detailing foreign interference in the 2020 election. In 2016  the CIA and FBI both confirmed foreign interference intended to help Trump.  Dominion machines gt Kremlin  Trump won fairly in 2016 and lost fairly in 2020. Not that hard to understand  Completely agree. Man I miss the days when the news was the news  and we didn  39 t have these avenues of misinformation ruining this country. Brainwashing to the nth degree.  Wel  it could be that Russia helped both times  but not enough in 2020.  There is actually evidence Russia helped  em both  em  sides in 2016.  I don  39 t believe their intent was to specifically make Trump win  they just wanted to sow division.  They just felt Trump was the underdog so they astroturfed for him more.  No  they DONT think  this is  a href   r conservative  r conservative  a    This. Signing a petition didn  39 t kill a cop  Because of  a href  https   www.washingtonpost.com national security us defends russian election interference 2020 10 21 533b508a 130a 11eb bc10 40b25382f1be story.html  rel  nofollow  this  a  perhaps.  Because it was never about them wanting trump in office  they wanted to hurt America.  Seeing everything unfold  they could not have hoped for a better outcome.  That would imply some sort of loyalty to Trump. While I m admittedly ignorant to the extent of Russian interference  it would be naive for someone to think that Putin s main goal was a Trump victory. Interference in the US elections was to discredit the voting process  disrupt the political landscape  destabilize the nation. If Putin thinks Bernie Sanders would accomplish that I m sure he d have no qualms about pushing him as hard as he can.  Russia has succeeded beyond their wildest expectations. Riotous mobs storming the capital fueled by misinformation. Putin is laughing his ass off at you.  You realize theyve had Russian trolls on basically every platform advocating for Trump  right  They  39 ve been doing that crap for 6 years. Social media has actively had to moderate it. They  39 ve literally slipped up and released locations on posts  from Russia. Most of them can  39 t even form complete sentences  but neither can a vast amount of Trump supporters  as it  39 s hard to tell the difference at times. Someone with broken English  posting from Russia about support for Trump and hate for the left... you don  39 t think  Hmm. People within the program have had interviews about it. Every counter intelligence division we have has confirmed it. They have massive govt sanctioned operations to disrupt foreign politics. Not just ours  but several other nations as well. They  39 ve hacked into nuclear sites. They are generally just causing chaos. And its working  obviously. A bunch of dumbfucks just stormed our own nation  39 s capitol. You don  39 t  for a second  think that they had a hand in encouraging people to go ape shit  If you don  39 t  you are incredibly naive. Using Trump and his oddly dedicated base is the best way to cause chaos here  all they need is to poke at people  39 s misplaced hate.  A petition seems more reasonable than an attempted coup  That  39 s because it is  Sorry  the memory of the screams of agony from the police officer that was being crushed into a door by a mob shouting heave ho as they were breaking into the capital to threaten my elected representatives is too fresh. But wow  signing a petition that is way more extreme  To be fair  they didn t riot after the results.  A lot of them wanted to  and many wished they had  but they didn t actually try to get their way with force.  Comparing last week to an online petition that you sign up for via email is quite a stretch.  On top of that  Trump lost the popular vote in 2016. So while people weren t technically in the right to contest the results as that s not how our system works  there was more precedent.  Trumpers grasping for straws.  I wish that mindset was not such a loud part of the conservative voice.  Trump and conservatism are completely synonymous in the eyes of 95   of people in the United States.  Conservative and republican are one in the same to 95   unfortunately  And hillary did win the popular vote and they stood on that ground  it was more of a petition to the Electoral college to change which was never going to happen  than to say the election was a fraud and Biden didnt really win. There  39 s quite a difference in both.  Also overturn wouldn  39 t have put Hilary in charge right  She was nobody at the time. It would be to hold another election.   Well yes  this Trumpy riot was insane. But leftists did riot after Trump won  just not at the capital   Imagine if Clinton had been recorded on the phone telling democrat state legislators to give her enough votes to win the state.  Furthermore  there was a lot more smoke with the 2016 election than this one. Multiple people were indicted as part of that investigation and it is pretty clear Russia did attempt to swing the election to trump.   quot At least 217 people were arrested in the melees  police said.  39   Think about this  they made the Vice President of the United States and the entirety of the United States Congress evacuate  hide  or barricade themselves  lest they be seen on LIVE TV hanging from the gallows erected outside the Capitol building   but less than half the number of people have been arrested than when black people got uppity  and the majority of them thus far have only been charged with misdemeanours.  Except this time we have the sitting president and dozens of congressmen pushing the fraud allegations and literal coup attempts happening at the capitol.  Interesting that like 5x as many people were arrested at that 2016 DC protest as compared to 1 6 21. I say interesting because they invaded the capitol building.  Yes  exactly. They didn  39 t storm the Capitol  em while the actual votes were being counted  em . That  39 s the difference between a protest and a coup.  Both   39 sides  39  are guilty of violence. It  39 s always going to be that way. I hate the way we are split like a bunch of football teams too.  Yup  I remember when a bunch of leftists beat a cop to death... oh  wait.  Violence is never justified . But as a human I can t help feeling more sympathy when there is an actual reason for the violence  systemic racism for example than when it s a pure fantasy    stolen votes   .  First of all its capitol  not capital. These riots were nowhere near as harmful as what was done at the capitol. Do not compare them.  But isn  39 t it the case that everyone who signed that petition in 2016 turned out to be right  The Constitution did need protecting from Trump  he did make an honest effort to install himself as dictator  everything in that petition is spot on.  No no. No one rioted after Trump won clearly not. Like there clearly wasn  39 t footage of people destroying shit and there clearly wasn  39 t t a petition to recount votes. Nope Trump is the only one to do this ever  Big difference is that those people didn t start because Hilary called  all true Patriots to DC   where she riled them up at a rally  called Stop the Steal   filled with disinformation to support her claim to have won the election. She didn t tell these folks that we have to bring the fight to them or that we needed trial by combat. She didn t send them to Congress to change Congress s mind.   beat police  one to death   With the american flag  while singing star spangled banner  It makes my blood boil.  Especially when you consider actual Nazis were there as well.  Thank God my grandfather  who fought in WWII  didn t have to see this.  When he was 95 he told me the only thing he wished was that he could just see how things progressed  he had such a positive view of America at the time.  He would have been 100 and seeing this would have been so sad.  Literal nazis killing cops in DC for the President.  Fuck.  There s a clear difference between a real conservative  and a populist like Trump in my mind.  Then the GOP needs to grow some balls and finally decry what has happened en masse and do something about it. Even after an attempted coup and prominent GOP officials had their lives threatened  they are still more worried about losing the Trump voters than doing the right thing. He  39 s a liability to the party and the country. Trump  39 s voters are loyal to Trump MAGA movement  not the GOP and they need to wake up and realize that. The GOP was a tool Trump needed to be elected  nothing more. If Trump does want to run again in 2024 the GOP now has to decide if they let him run their party again  or if he runs as an independent and guarantees a democratic win as the vote is split. Remove him from office and impeach to ensure he never runs again. Inaction shows that this behavior was acceptable  and the next time  under Trump or his successor  they might be a lot better organized.  If the GOP is any indication  with their attempts to still protect Trump nearly a week after his attempted coup  there is no discernible or appreciable difference.  I recently read  I don  39 t remember where  something like  quot In a healthy democracy  violence is always out of bounds because any reasonable reform can be achieved at the ballot box. quot   Oh my God so much  sup  sup    sup   sup  this.  Yeah  lets compare the 99.99  peaceful 2017 Women  39 s March  with no deaths  to last week  39 s  quot HANG MIKE PENCE quot  chants  a dead cop  4 dead supporters  and an attempt to take senators hostage.  Yeah the difference is hillary  who i do not like  didnt start a tirade of unsubstantiated claims and conspiracy theories for months to provoke the rioters  also there  39 s a huge difference between a petition and storming the capitol  i suppose you think if it was done before then its ok for trump to repeat it now because others done it 4 years ago or 8 years ago or even 100 years ago.  A civilian signing a petition is not the same thing as a president going to court  keep up.  And then those 5 million people went and stormed the US Capitol building when they didn  39 t get their way... oh wait  But according to all the memes  only leftists riot and protest when they don t get their way.  Didn t you know every liberal city in America is in ruins because of antifa    Waiting for you to be silenced because you re not a flared user on their  free speech  forum  This subreddit is pretty open about not being unbiased  Didn t fit the narrative at the time.  Online petitions don  39 t really mean shit. They  39 re like wishes on shooting stars.  People not wanting trump in office  Sounds exactly like the narrative the last 4 years  Or it wasn  39 t pushed as the saving grace because she had already conceded the election  and didn  39 t go around trying to convince everyone that she won by a landslide  And then everyone involved was banned from all of the internet and humanity  I remember it so well.  Let us pause for 3 seconds and list the names of elected officials that supported the overturning of the 2016 election result  Yes because signing a petition is the same as literally storming the capital  beating someone to death  and bring in pipe bombs and zip ties to execute politicians  Well  let  39 s be real  Back then there wasn  39 t a coup involved that killed police officers  the losing party wasn  39 t quoting Hitler and intelligence agencys found evidence for russian tampering.  2016   a couple million angry people on the internet signed a petition. Clinton conceded immediately after the election.   Don t forget to add to 2016  knit pink hats and peacefully marched in support of women s rights  And then they stormed the capitol building  killed a cop  threatened senators and the Vice President  and five died in the process ... oh wait.  Yes  let us pause and remember how 5 000 000 patriotic citizens used their first amendment rights to sign a petition in peaceful protest and compare that to today when sore losers staged a violent coup in a failed attempt to destroy our democracy. Thank you for pointing out how dissimilar these events are.  In hind sight we see what they were concerned about. Still  Trump won in 2016 and took office as he should. What he did with it lead to his defeat in 2020. Now we move on.  Did any of them break into a federal building and try to kill members of Congress   And literally beat a cop to death  They didn  39 t raid the fucking Capitol.  If we keep pausing  the dems will keep winning. Time for the GOP to wake up and realize that trump destroyed our party. Not the dems  liberals  BLM  no  trump destroyed it  Back in 2016 I fell for the election promises he made. I thought he  39 d bring about a stronger America.  I was completely duped by a madman  you guys give me faith in humanity  so glad there are still sane conservative s about.  I d rather admit I m wrong than try to make excuses.  It s a good thing this isn t  flaired  only  else you d never see rational discourse.  With a lot of help from other Republicans  not just the elected representatives who went along with his agenda  refused to condemn even his worst actions  but also the millions of rank and file Republicans who voted for him  the people who knew that he was a perennial liar  a serial adulterer  utterly unprepared for the presidency and with no interest in becoming prepared  who  39 d cheated his way out of serving in the military  and bragged about grabbing women by the genitals... and didn  39 t think any of that was a deal breaker.  The first half is not a problem with republicans  it s a problem with a party system which allows the president to control where campaign money goes. They went along with his agenda in order to continue their career. It s messed up and needs to be changed. Second half I have no rebuttal for  Let us pause and remember when participants at a republican rally beat a cop to death.   a href  https   pbs.twimg.com media ErWiHhuW4AAIXjR format jpg amp name medium  https   pbs.twimg.com media ErWiHhuW4AAIXjR format jpg amp name medium  a     Because 5 million signatures is exactly the same as invading a federal building  vandalizing  stealing and disrupting legal federal operations.    quot But that was totally different   Someone tampered with the results   I know there  39 s proof because I read it on reddit  quot   The Russia thing was about election  em interference  em   not election fraud. Russia spread disinformation on social media. It did not tamper with ballots.  Did you read the link   What s wrong with signing a petition and how does it relate to causing multiple deaths and breaking into a secure federal building trying to hang Mike Pence   No one claimed there was tampering.  The fact that he s dangerous on top of losing the popular vote and still winning the electoral college was the focus.  Almost self aware.  Did they storm the capitol and murder a cop   Because he lost the popular vote... by a lot....  5 000 000 people saw this coming  yeah i think there s a big difference between singing a petition and charging the capitol while chanting things like  hang mike pence    Member when protestors tried to breach the White House back in May  allegedly forcing Secret Service to take Trump to the bunker  and it was celebrated   They didn  39 t try to breach the Whitehouse. They were standing outside protesting. Also they are doing renovations on the original gate so there  39 s another fence that  39 s like 200  ft from the original gate and it stands like 12ft tall. You can barely even see the Whitehouse from behind it. No one was climbing or even violently shaking the fence either. What they actually did was post their protest signs to it and keep it moving.    quot The scene on Friday night  described by a person with firsthand knowledge  kicked off an uneasy weekend at the White House as demonstrations spread after the brutal death of a black man in police custody under a white officer s knee. While in the end officials said they were never really in danger  Mr. Trump and his family have been rattled by protests near the Executive Mansion that turned violent for a third night on Sunday. quot   Was that before or after they laid seige to the Federal Court house for months  So hard to remember sometimes...  Was that before or after they claimed US soil as sovereign territory named CHAZ   Since it is not reported more than polite necessary people don t remember. It is all about what makes the news  how much it is reported and with how high energy it is reported. Trump in a bunker  I have slight remembering of that. Can t tell what happened or why.  You  39 re comparing BLM protestors NEAR the whitehouse to protestors marching straight from the presidents rally  to capitol hill and immediately storming the place...  BLM protestors didn  39 t even try to enter the white house  what are you talking about  There is no evidence they attempted to breach the white house.  Also  subject matter is important.  but did they open the door for them in order to take a shit in the middle of the White House   Do you have a good source for this  That  39 s insane    a href  https   www.nytimes.com 2020 05 31 us politics trump protests george floyd.html  NYT  As Protests and Violence Spill Over  Trump Shrinks Back  a   Did protesters actually enter the white house  Were any armed   No and no  lol. Protesting near the White House and other federal buildings is 100  legal and a normal thing to do. Bringing weapons  bombs  and zip ties while actually breaching a federal building chanting  Hang Mike Pence  is 100  NOT legal and NOT normal.  Yeah  it was a popular thing to tease Trump on social media for  hiding  for a day after he made his lackluster TV appearance after the George Floyd riots started. It wasn t good optics.   I  39 m confused  that said the protestors gathered near the White House  not that they breached it and attempted to lynch Trump   Conservatives are liars. Period. No one tried to storm the whitehouse over the summer.  I actually don  39 t remember this. What was the situation   Oh my God  Not A PETITION  Heeeellllp   and Madonna and friends thought a lot about blowing up the White House.  This is not even CLOSE to comparable.   the republican party is dead they used to be reasonable people  now you have people posting garbage like this to defend what went on last week.  The right can sign any petitions they want  too  and I  39 m sure some have already been made. Liberals didn  39 t raid the capitol and kill a cop when we were upset  they protested and signed petitions like true patriots. They didn  39 t attack fellow Americans like traitors and call for the hanging of congressmen that disagree with their point of view.  Posts like these are why this subreddit has a bad name. Who cares if someone signed a petition  That is not a federal crime  that is freedom of speech. That is literally what this country is about.   Change.org doesn t do anything except for pedal your information to advertisers.  You are equating meaningless online petitions with an armed invasion of the seat of American democracy.  And no homegrown terrorist uprisings that lead to an assault on the nation s Capitol.  .............. did they storm the fucking government  force their way in  smear shit on the walls  beat a cop to death  and then get started on plan  2   And then those 5 million stormed the capital and attempted a coup...  Signing a petition  lt  storming the capitol  No one stormed the Capitol that time though.  At least they only signed a petition and didn t storm the capital and kill a cop...  Let  39 s also remember when none of them  at the urging of Obama  stormed the Capitol  threw racial slurs at Capitol Police  killed one  and smeared feces on the wall. Get the fuck out of here with your false equivocation.  If it wasn  39 t for the double standard they would have no standard. It helps when you have propaganda on your side.  Do you remember how many red states signed secession petitions online when Obama won re election in 2012  History doesn t end four years ago.   a href  https   en.wikipedia.org wiki 2012 U.S. state secession petitions  https   en.wikipedia.org wiki 2012 U.S. state secession petitions  a   Probably more than 4 years  and the last 2 or 3 weeks took it to a new level.  Based on the headline alone  I  39 m not really sure this holds a candle to  you know  the thousands storming the capitol to force an overturning via  insert individual insurrectionist  39 s plan here   Did any of those petition signers  a href  https   pbs.twimg.com media ErWiHhuW4AAIXjR format jpg amp name medium  rel  nofollow  do shit like this   a   Yes  because signing a petition and storming the Capitol to stage a coup are the same thing. smh  Because trump lost the popular vote in 2016 that s why it was petitioned to be overturned. Actual facts. He lost the popular vote again  his followers want it overturned anyway  but instead of having facts they have baseless conspiracy theories  and instead of petitioning they organize a terrorist attack on innocent people.  A petition is a little different than a terrorist attack on the nation  39 s capital. Trying to justify an attack like that is a pretty bad look.  But  like  did they threaten to hang Mike Pence and murder members of Congress   Another online petition is literally the least threatening thing anyone could do to another person lol.  Theres no way to overturn Americas election   russia interfered by troll farms and bots in a misinformation campaign.  See FBI report  Lmao it was a petition not a coup attempt.  Sure  people have the right to protest election results. Actually  to protest any government policies they oppose. At the same time anyone who burns shops or destroys public property should be prosecuted. Since Trump won  there have been many women s marches opposing his administration.  As long as they are peaceful  I have no problems with them.  Anybody die   But they didn t storm the Capitol lmao  No one thought the election was fraudulent when that petition was signed. They were tired of winning the popular vote but losing the office thanks to the antiquated electoral college. There s a HUGE difference here.  It  39 s a little embarrassing to see fellow conservatives who claim to be patriots but don  39 t understand how America works. Petitions are okay. Attacking the capitol is not okay. I feel like you don  39 t need a law degree to understand that much.  Last i checked their wasn  39 t any insurrection with those  True but no one attacked a federal building and attempted to take hostages.  remember when they stormed the capital also   geez. what a way to bring down the other side after the events of last week.  We should also pause to note that Hillary Clinton didn  39 t take part in that petition  or allege fraud.  Signed a petition  not stormed the Capitol  Remember how RADICAL LEFT ANTIFA stormed the capitol in 2016   So the population of LA signed a petition...  Did they storm the Capitol and commit treason  I am amazed so many of you want to die on this hill.  Ah yes  I remember the time Hillary supporters stormed the Capitol building with tactical weapons and flex cuffs. This is clearly the same thing.   Anyone care to explain how signing a petition and violently storming the capitol and stopping the electoral count which caused 5 deaths and a multitude of injuries are even remotely in the same universe   Yes a  a href  https   change.org  change.org  a  petition is very much the same as storming the capital of the united states  great analogy conservatives.  At least the left didn  39 t kill at least 5 people over it.  this post is getting brigaded. kudos to the mods for trying to open things up again  Oh crap a non flaired post  am I in the right sub   Incredible. What is wrong with you  80  of the comments and posts deflection and relativization.  America only spiraling deeper and deeper into hate.   Yeah all the Russia talk following 2016 election was embarrassing to say the least  but signing a petition is abit different to breaching the fucking seat of government lol  At least they didn t storm the capital  Im surprised this isnt on flaired users only already. All the other top posts are lol.

He  39 s just pivoting to usher in a grand new era.   deleted   Ding ding ding   People have been calling this since day one. That as soon as Trump was out  the BLM and Covid  19 inflammatory reporting would stop. BLM has all but ceased to even be a talking point for the most part and Covid 19 will be next. I am sure Biden will try to take credit for his impeccable response time lol  piggybacking off Trumps hard work in no time flat.  The explanation is obvious   he no longer needs the hostages.

t3_kvd2ur,Biden Says Minority and WomenOwned Small Businesses Priority,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvd2ur/biden_says_minority_and_womenowned_small/,I wonder if a Black woman owned a gun shop if she  39 d be eligible for federal aid.  Honestly a fair question my friend.   White  is a minority in California.  Does that mean they get preferential treatment   Im confused.  I thought we couldn  39 t say  quot women quot  anymore. is this only for vagina holding small business owners   Are   39 vagina holding  39  and   39 pussy grabbing   39  the same thing  Asking for a friend...  Not everyone with a vagina is a woman and not all women have vaginas. You can say woman in this case because it means just women.  I ll just call women  things  then. Since there s no proper term  we ll just resort back to the old days of objectifying women. Wtf   yes  biological women are once again to be reduced to a sex organ.  As a biological woman I find this hilarious  thank you. The new normal is simply insanity.  Amen   I totally forgot to add the fact I was interpreting this in leftist. I don  39 t personally believe it.  I think it s  em Homo sapiens  em  containing 2 X chromosomes on the 23rd pair.  So instead of all American small business getting help only minorities and women owned businesses are going to get help . I thought he said that he will bring us all together .  That was never the message  to be sure.  To be honest  he only said it out of one side of his mouth.  tldr  Biden says   quot suck it whitey boys  you  39 re on your own. Now let  39 s have some fuckin  39  unity  quot   The left is just working harder and harder to destabilize the US.  Their lockdowns have killed a lot of businesses and jobs.  Leaving many people with little to lose.  Now saying that the men that have lost everything aren  39 t worth helping is just adding fuel to the fire.  How is this not a civil rights violation   It is. As soon as he is in office and starts it lawsuits will be filed.  doesn  39 t matter because the Supreme court will go along with all of the nonsense.  No they wont.  Sure they won  39 t  I dont think they would  we have the majority but most of the justices didn  39 t want to be the one to   39 disenfranchise  39  millions of voters. But with shit like this  i dont see them doing it.  We won  39 t have the majority after they pack the courts.  If they do it will start a war. I genuinely dont think they would attempt that.  Everything they have been doing has had the effect of dividing the people and inflaming tension. At this point I  39 m having a hard time finding any explanation besides it being intentional. They are trying to start a war.  I m Asian American  amp  I don t need his identity politics crap.  Go shove it  buddy.  I self identify as a minority female.  Can t we all just identify as Native American like Pocahontas Warren did   Solves all the issues right   Guess I m Trans now    s   Unity    Only applies to leftists and their chosen oppressed groups.  How about ALL small businesses dipstick  A family member  39 s small business is struggling as is and he really needs a boost. So what if he is white  black or poka dot  ALL small business should be helped.  Sounds quite sexist  racist  and discriminatory.  A priority for sniffing.  Kamala already running the show.  Does he not think that white business owners also hire minority workers.  Hey look our new  president   is good at discrimination. Shocked.   quot You know what I love in my america  discrimination on the basis of race and gender quot    Biden and the Democratic party.  This is already the case. I bid public works construction projects  99  of public works has set asides for both already. As a veteran owned business I have 3  set asides.  Part of the Great Reset   But the businesses owned by white men  and their employees  can continue to suffer.  What is really sad is that children of all races are being neglected and going hungry. But hey  politics Trump hungry kids. But go for it Uncle Joe. Go for it Nancy.
t3_kv45t6,Boycott Big Tech The Best Way for Conservatives to Fight Back,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv45t6/boycott_big_tech_the_best_way_for_conservatives/,I am normally against boycotting businesses just because their owners officers have different views than mine.  As long as they are minding their own business  I have no issue with them.  Already done. In the past two months I ve deleted Facebook  cancelled my prime subscription and all my prime video channels  Apple Music  Netflix for working on a Trump smear piece with the Obama s.  None of my money is going to any of these companies until they change course.  Good  Same here  deleted all those apps and subscriptions  I canceled my Prime today.  Been a member since I can remember.  No more.  I  39 m already a good part of the way there. I  39 m staying on FB for networking reasons staying connected with friends and family  not likely gonna do anything politically there .  That  39 s good  Glad to hear how unconnected you are to Big Tech. And yeah  Google is probably the most difficult to escape from. My proposed solution  for now  is to buy phones from Samsung. I know they use the Android operating system  but at least Samsung is otherwise unconnected to Google and not really and SJW minded company. That  39 s not perfect  of course  but I think it  39 s the best we can do for now.  I currently have a OnePlus device  and I  39 m going to research more earnestly into Rooting processes. Gotta dump that Google bloatware...  I haven  39 t heard of OnePlus  do they completely avoid Google software  If so  they might be an excellent alternative  I  39 ve had a OnePlus 3 since launch. I would like to replace it but the damn thing won  39 t break. They are great phones but it  39 s a Chinese based company and they use Android.  Google Android is far worse than Apple.  Counterpoint  Android allows for side loading apps that have been removed from the Google Play store  while Apple does not. This is especially important in the wake of the Parler debacle.  You can still do that with iPhones  but it takes more effort and it is riskier business   a href  https   www.wired.com story install apps outside app store sideload   rel  nofollow  https   www.wired.com story install apps outside app store sideload   a   Does it involve jailbreak ing it  That  39 ll void the warranty...  It does.  Yes  it  39 s much riskier and harder to do than with Android.  Stop directing your 401k into these large cap funds that are tech stock heavy.  Absolutely. One of the easiest ways to do that is with equal weighted etfs rather than the traditional ones that are heavily weighted towards the FAANG stocks. Not perfect  but easy to implement and quite effective IMO.  Most of these boomers jumping shop to Parler probably dont even know they are up to 36  invested in social media.  Yup. That issue needs to be brought more to light. I think it will be as more articles are written on this topic  Most of these old timers jumping ship to Parler probably dont even know they are up to 36  invested in social media.  Leaving these social network platforms is not enough   Their product is advertising and as long as advertisers believe they help get customers they are not going to leave.  We need to poison their product.  If 75 000 000 trump supporters wrote letters to advertisers on twitter saying we won  39 t buy their products as long as they advertise on twitter   it could be gone in a few weeks.  Yeah why do people keep trying to reason with them. Spend 10 minutes scrolling through related posts on this sub and you will quickly discover just how bad the double standards are. They have created a game where either you say the things they want you to say or get blacklisted.  we need our own telecoms   oem hardware software   delivery services   social ect.  Yeah so alternatively  if we mass migrate to certain platforms money will talk. At the end of the day  these investors don t give a shit about the SJW stuff. If they see us fleeing  the money will follow.   I agree that that may force the big players to bend the knee however this is bigger than that.   These companies and their employees  by a large margin  are funding our opposition.  These companies need to be bled dry.   Our money needs to go to companies that support America and our way of life.  This is a zero sum game we are playing now and it needs to be acknowledged and become front and center to any strategy going forward.  I think more and more conservatives are starting to recognize that. The next few months should see Twitter and others plummet in value as about half the country flees them for alternatives. Maybe that s overly optimistic  but it could happen if current trends hold  We need solid red state alternatives and infrastructure.  We need this divorce to hurt the left more than it hurts us.  Agreed. I think much of that infrastructure exists  but is still in relative infancy. Hopefully it will develop more as conservatives flee traditional online infrastructure like Google and Facebook  Hey I sent you a DM when you get a chance  Just did    a href   r degoogle  rel  nofollow  r degoogle  a   Is this a wise idea  Would this not cause Big Tech to double down on their policies  since in the hypothetical situation conservatives would no longer be part of their audience   That might happen. In fact  you  39 re probably right that it will. However  if we  39 re uninvolved because we use different services products  then how would that affect us at any real level   Look at what happened to Parler and any other non mainstream social media  they are all classified by mainstream media as a place for the ists and phobes to gather. The platforms are dropped by their hosting service  payment processors  and search indexes. They are also infiltrated by bad actors who post material that would cause the sites to be targeted by the government. Another problem that the alternative sites have is that they are restricted to a narrow audience which means it will not reach mainstream status and credibility.   Yes those are problems that need to be addressed. However  I think they will be as more people switch to them. That might take time but will  I think  ultimately happen. Just look at where we are now  leagues ahead of where we were a few years ago  I just think that the actions that conservatives are taking is reminiscent of their retreat from the Entertainment industry and academia  and in doing so will imitate the loss of power and influence that retreat caused. Also there are so many alternatives that the base will likely scatter and not have enough traffic for the alternatives to live. Which will cause a win for the mainstream sites.  That  39 s a fair point. I think some  however  might prove to be effective substitutes that many conservatives use. Parler and Rumble  specifically  have the potential to be widely adopted

Big brother knowns you aren  39 t a true believer  be prepared to be audited and thrown in prison for your crimes.  We  39 re about to see what real systemic racism looks like.  It s approved by those in power  and those who speak up are going to be dogged till they are fired as we are seeing happening right now.   It  39 s gonna be a weird four years.  Biggest understatement of 2021  It took a lot of effort to understate that.  He learned so much from Robert Byrd.  The great reset. Much like the redistribution of wealth and property in Zimbabwe  it ensures an economic collapse that will keep Biden  39 s party in power for a long time. Expect to see some Blue States take it a step further and prioritize vaccine  then healthcare along those lines over need.  But equal protection clause   Some races are more equal than others comrade.  Racist and gender phobic.  From now on it is  quot illegal quot  to post this ugly face because it makes people sick and may pose mental damage.
t3_kuzchp,Twitters Jack Dorsey Mocks Parler Purge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuzchp/twitters_jack_dorsey_mocks_parler_purge/,Biden  39 s election is so legitimate that you have to persecute anyone saying otherwise.  They re following the greats such as Stalin  Mussolini   Xi Jinping and their favourite of all Adolf hitler.  It s so legitimate that they censor all evidence of fraud because we know that fraud didn t happen anyways  The real story  outside of Trump  is that a business was able to have its competitor taken offline and then openly mocked its competitor after the fact. Kind of like how CNN is calling for Fox News to be taken down. Companies that are in Biden  39 s back pocket are able to say  quot take down our competitor  make us the only game in town quot  and it gets done. They don  39 t even need to hide it.  This. Is the point ive been trying to tell people. They  39 re framing it as terrorism or w.e but what it  39 s really about is competition and power. Gab.com is going to crush them  its a million times better.  I made sure to grab an account over there the other day. I don  39 t know what  39 s in store for the next few weeks but I wanted to make sure I stayed in the loop about where to go next or what everyone has been saying  with all of our favorite conservative voices being taken offline.  Ive been making repetitive posts about gab. Trying to make sure everyone sees it and keep people in the loop. Its actually really good too.  Jack Dorsey has something seriously wrong with him. Special kinda fucked in the head.  Read  quot Hatching Twitter quot . He  39 s a piece of shit who basically stole the company.  Oh. Wow. Heading there now  Honestly he was probably a loser in high school and this is all his ego getting back at his childhood bullies.  This isn  39 t just about Trump anymore  this is straight up censorship...  No collusion to see here at all  absolitely none.  What they don t see is that when the  conservative  media is gone they will be left to only eat each other until one is left standing.  This won t end with republican censorship.  Thus right here. They ve tasted blood and it will never end.  The fact that he s so god dammed smug and obvious about his support for censorship is appalling.  Im mocking their stock price  Gab.com is dope  Little slow cuz they  39 re scaling up with the rush of traffic but if ur willing to wait for pages to load you can sign up. I got in and its sweet. Very nice UI  better than parler. Sell off big tech stock of u got it  vote with your wallet friends.  All the leftists on any popular subreddit will gaslight you by saying this is a free market response  not suppression of free speech. Welcome to the  strong spin zone  strong   baby   Filthy sellout.  Literally filthy. You can smell and taste the odor from his rasputin beard in photos.  Garbage people do garbage things.  There is a place in hell for this garbage human.  That will be a burden he must cross one day of which I m sure he will Mock the whole way leading up to it.  I hope he can repent before it s too late for himself.  Alex Jones was the beginning  regardless of what you think of the man  he should ve NEVER been blacklisted from the Internet  and now POTUS Trump is their latest trophy. It won t stop with Trump either. At this point  anyone slightly right of Stalin can will be Thanos snapped from the Internet for any reason thought they don t like. I honestly thought I would never see this kind of stuff in real life.  C  39 mon guys  they  39 re just censoring us because we censored them first when President Trump won in 2016 and they denied it...oh wait.  Technofascism is here.  Ultimately this can be a good thing. Amazon has such a monopoly on hosting and other internet services and they just created a huge market for a competitor over night.  All non left leaning news outlets should take note and invest in making a competitor.  Gab.com is sweet. Sluggish right now cuz theyre scaling up but i was patient and got in  def worth it. The UI is great   Would love to see that tweet used as evidence one day  The ultimate problem is that conservatives play by the rules and liberals make the rules.  Jack Dorsey is bin Laden  No where near as smart.  And bin laden at least had the balls to call out his enemy from around the world while hiding in a cave.  Dorsey gave no notice before he started nuking accounts.  This just proves it has nothing to do with moderating content on his platform. It  39 s about censoring political speech he disagrees with.  Patriots are rolling over in their graves. All jokes aside  I think we will all be in gulags by the years end. They are trying to literally erase us  and don t even try to hide it anymore. Incredible.   Fck Jack   Remember Whitey Bolger    Jack dorsey looks and acts like the mandarin off of Ironman.  Whenever he gets asked a really tough question on why Twitter did   39 xyz  39  its like he  39 s looking off camera for his handlers to tell him why and instead he gets hung out to dry.  And the charade continues.  A true story about Fortune Cookies  wait that s not right  I don t think it was ever about Trump  it was about attacking and silencing us. Trump was just a good catalyst to use.  First they came for the      From now on it is  quot illegal quot  to post this ugly face because it makes people sick and may pose mental damage.  Keep on shorting the Twitter stock. They are extremely vulnerable.

These companies need to be treated as publishers at this point.  This hands off approach is actually dangerous for the country and all the libertarian come backs for addressing it are not realistic.  Can Biden pardon a company  Seems like that would be a get out of jail for all the collusion and anti trust they are doing right now. I assume biden would be fine with it after all Zuck already donated lots for the georgia run off and Hunter can take the money in necessary to get the pardon   Unfortunately  all of the big five tech companies are legally corporations. A corporation is legally defined as a person for most purposes.  Trump wanted to drain the swamp. Biden is the swamp.

Not only people buying into the stocks but also realizing how convenient Twitter  amp  Facebook are and not willing to make the sacrifice. Hope I  39 m wrong.  If Trump be gone  then Twitter shall also be gone.  Interesting take could be a lawsuit by shareholders that they violated their fiduciary responsibility.    Because Twitter was just a machine for people to send harassing replies to the President  amp  bitch about his every move. It was over 99  Trump related content  amp  less than 1  everything else. There  39 s nothing to talk about if they can  39 t talk about him.  I thought this was a Babylon bee and I was thinking  how tf does twitter share a sink   The thing is that this won t stop them  they don t care.

Yet none of these threats occured in 2016.  Has Rogan even covered the riots   He caved to Spotify  It  39 s kind of what I thought. Over the summer he seemed to cover the BLM stuff a lot  it was just strange to basically hear nothing about what was going on in DC. I guess  100MM is too sweet. Can  39 t say I blame him.  What in the communist fuck is going on with our country   They cheated and they won  so now they can do whatever they want with no fear of ever losing again  After Parler  media platforms are terrified of being removed completely. This is hell on earth... but  Have faith...we cannot give up.  Pravda is the only state approved media outlet. All others have to be destroyed.  Ben Shapiro is the largest conservative podcast in the nation  he should tell Cumulus to suck it  The lengths they are going to in order to shut people up and not do a 10 day audit is very illustrative.    Cracking down on anyone who dares questions results make me think they are terrified of what we might find if we actually investigated properly.  For years  myself and other pundits have questioned if we live in two Americas. What we  39 re witnessing now is the physical manifestation of that terrible notion. An entire population where one side does not talk to the other    a house divided which cannot stand.  The fix. Wonder how long this has been planned   Those guys are big enough to form their own media company. I wonder how  quot Cumulus Media quot  would fair without them   If they do  move on over to BlazeTV  Disputing elections was all hip in 2016....and Cumulus Media didn  39 t so squat.  The only reason to fire them for speaking of election fraud is because they know the fraud is real.  It  39 s happening.

Totally not sus at all. No explanation  no dissents  but just a  quot nah  we  39 re just gonna ignore this quot   They didn  39 t reject the case they rejected the motion to hear it before inauguration. This means they can say yes it was true but it  39 s too late now. They can issue rules for going forward.  Yes  but what could be done about the election after Biden  39 s innaugration  Will they come back and say   quot Well  he really shouldn  39 t have been given the Presidency  so let  39 s take it away from him and put Donald Trump into the office. quot   They can rule about things going forward. Which is what they rather do. After they rejected the other case from texas its what I expected. It  39 s honestly better than nothing. I would take being vindicated that it was fraud and I  39 m not crazy. We are left with hope 22 will be able to change things.  If they ignored literal constitutional laws in this election  what  39 s stopping them from just ignoring a judges rulings   It  39 s the green light for the Dem  39 s to cheat in every election.
t3_kvgxvd,PayPal Blocks Group That Helped Trump Supporters Travel to D.C.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvgxvd/paypal_blocks_group_that_helped_trump_supporters/,This is where it starts getting dangerous. You can t access money or get paid if you fall foul of mob.  When you say  dangerous  do you mean after the censorship power grab and starting to effect people s livelihoods is dangerous territory for these corporations or do you mean dangerous that people who are being silenced and now pickpocketed will become an actual threat  Just curious because both options are dangerous but the first tends to lead to the second.  When banks and corporations start stopping people getting paid or run a business that is dangerous. It is bad enough not having a voice and yes one does lead to another like you said  but start denying money or jobs and people absolutely will have nothing left to lose.  Exactly and it seems the powers that be are clueless of this fact as they continue to find new ways to poke the bear  seriously stop poking the bear  I say that in jest but this could get seriously out of hand   Don  39 t they understand they are making what they have been afraid of all this time.  I honestly believe this is a planned and coordinated attempt to force people into violence that they can blame on the right and use it to push their gun agenda no matter the cost  the media was inundated and still is with interviews with all the leftist politicians who were fearing for their lives and the PTSD they now have from the capital incident. They are actively calling for the removal of all conservative politicians who objected to the electoral votes  which is literally something they do every year a republican is elected and to top it off their objections are on the basis of fraud.  Then when they try to push through their gun agenda they make even more crazies  I hope they understand what they are doing.  A little quote with modern terminology   Let it.  It  39 s better it comes to a head  rather than slowly eating away at the country forever.  Dangerous for us or them   Btw PayPal is entirely owned by China  Exactly what I was thinking. I m convinced the past year has all been a foreign attack by China. Legitimately. They want us on board with what they re doing to the world and our leaders are allowing it due to fear  That s legit all I can think of. No one born in America  or even immigrants to America should be behind this mess.  Have they blocked the Groups that bail out leftist rioters   No. They have not. And if they have  the never made it public.  No  they just get cheated into the White House.  If you want to buy heroin on the dark web  PayPal is happy to help.  PayPal wasn  39 t secure enough to stop someone from hijacking my account but at least they stopped my account from being drained. I never unlocked my account so I don  39 t need to boycott them.

The  quot source quot  being the journalist  39 s imagination.  And while Trump has been cut off from comms so he can  39 t defend himself.  If trump is responsible for this  then the logic should to apply to blm being responsible for the destruction of cities and businesses  but they will never get the blame. You really can  39 t control what an angry mob does.  Actually  every Democrat that supported BLM ANTIFA should be held accountable too.

It s got to be. Human nature. Orwell is being thrown around a lot. People are learning and buying. I suffered through the first part of the movie a while ago and turned it off. Very interested in watching it through now.  Don  39 t watch it. The movie is crap. Read the book. That  39 s actually got the best arguments he  39 s trying to make.  Personally  I find animal farm to make a bit of a finer point and it s a quicker read but they re both great.  The movie is okay but the book is really great.  It s a cool book. You should read it.  This will no doubt sound ridiculous but I  39 m actually a little concerned for what  39 s happening to America. I know an over reaction and I  39 m sure I  39 ll be mocked and torn to pieces in replies but watching this from the outside  UK  and knowing the laws that have been passed here and having always seen America as the last place of true freedom I  39 m actually a little concerned.   Only a little  Just come out and say it   we re in SERIOUS trouble. People need to wake up.  As a Brit I m trying to hide my emotions but Yh I think you guys are in major trouble especially if you don t conform and agree.  Our nation was founded opposing tyranny. Things could get ugly with the armed citizenry.  That s what I m thinking will be next. The only place I know of that has people and leaders who are pro gun is Texas who seem to be ready to defend their rights. Not sure about the other States.  That  39 s not as true as it once was. Not too long ago Robert Francis  quot Beto quot  Ororke narrowly lost to Ted Cruz.  States like South Dakota and Wyoming are much more red but they  39 re a lot smaller.  Oh. I only ever see or hear about Texas being pro gun etc but Yh I m sure there s more.  The worst thing about the way the world is going is that it was the UK that gave the world the concept of personal liberty and natural rights.  In many ways the cradle of the philosophy that enabled western civilisation.  And the brits seem to have happily thrown that all away.    Yh even the constitution was in part inspired by the magna carter. The U.K. isn t a bastion of freedom anymore. There are some laws that have been brought in to change that and London alone has more cameras looking at the population that I think any other major city in Europe. I ve even seen politicians giving interviews and talking about vaccine certificates or QR codes on their phones to say you ve been given your vaccine. I can t be sure on the whole but it seems the U.K. isn t paying attention to how much we are losing including recent reports about the police wanting the right to enter people s home during the pandemic to break up  illegal gatherings .   I think the problem is comfort.  People  especially those whose idea of travelling is to go to resort hotels  have no idea how hard to obtain and fragile civilisation is  and how shitty life still is for many people  particularly those without freedom   property rights  etc.  We  39 ve had a pretty good run for the last few years  and so people think they have the luxury of destroying it all for their personal benefit and nothing will go wrong.    You ve pretty much hit the nail on the head there. I think since modern smart phones we ve become a people who spend 90  of their time looking at their phone screen than the world around them. It s how politicians and the powerful get away with their BS.  You  39 re overreacting... until you  39 re not.  For people that condemn the third reich every chance they get  they sure do love using their methods.  I m so tired of being called a Nazi for caring about basic human rights  while the fuckers calling it are plagiarizing the playbook  I feel you  brother. Just a few days back I got a DM calling me a fascist  and comparing Trump to Hitler.  It honestly feels like we  39 re in some kind of information civil war with some members of the left. Literally anything conservative is attempted to be branded as a far right conspiracy theory.  They also like to ignore the fact that Nazi was alang for National SOCIALIST party. They werent even right wing  the government people controlled the ecobomy and the means of production  everyone had a job  most got paid the same  and it was SOCIALISM  with a dash of nationalism for Germany.  All socialists are nationalistic historically. Like saying they aren  39 t ia being ignorant of history. However the confusion comes when we compare the American right and left vs the rest of the world.    deleted   Projection.  I think it s to rationalize their animosity. They know conservatives aren t Nazis especially the top ones the elite rich Democrats and party insiders. They ve grown more and more vitriolic and it has to be rationalized somehow you can t be this blatantly hypocritical unless you establish a foundation of justification. That s all the constant attacks and defamation are. That way when it comes to actually silencing us it s easily portrayed as  silencing radicals . The sheep has no idea I graduated from a Cal State this last spring trust me when I say my peers are some of the most ignorant people who consider themselves some of the most informed. They have zero idea what the average Republican or conservative believe only the caricature they ve been given.  Kinda like Animal Farm    removed   No  it  39 s OK you see. By definition the only voices being silenced are Nazi ones so there  39 s no problem with this  see   Reminds me of witch trials.  quot Oh  maybe she wasn  39 t... Never mind  it  39 s too late to care anyway. Neeeeext   quot    quot Maybe she wasn  39 t a witch  but we can  39 t take any risks... quot   You mean like 99  of them standing around outside  Or do you include those who were waving Trump banners as also being part of the violence   I didn t expect anyone to break into the capital building. Just though conservatives were better than that overall.  The were  strong LET IN  strong  by the DC POLICE  Except we didn  39 t get a brand new flat screen tv  a dishwasher  or even a pair of Jordan  39 s out of it.  Naw... instead of sneakers they got a few souvenirs out of the offices of members of congress and stole some camera equipment from the press. And one guy apparently decided he wanted a podium for some reason.  They also went all in on silencing political opponents after blaming them for an attack on the German capitol which included many Nazis posing as their political opponents.  Here I thought liberals didn  39 t like history.   Reminds me of all the Facebook trolls and Twittertards talking about how the capitol riot was all about  white privelege   Reddit banned the Donald for threatening cops then not even a year later all of reddit was relishing in the death of police.  The attacking  I hate calling it that. A couple hundred people who walked around aimlessly and took photos for the most most part. I know some broke a few windows and stole a laptop.  seat of power sounds too much like the reichstag fire too me for my liking.  lol the brigading is real.  Yeah I mean shit I even think I  39 m getting alarmist at times but damn it if everything about this shit doesn  39 t feel wrong and like it is going to end badly.  Top selling on  em Amazon.  em  Fucking ironic.  So  as Amazon is selling books that promote violence and revolt eg  quot Mein Kampf quot   does that mean that AWS  Amazon web services  wiil now refuse to host Amazon.  s  Yeah  I m starting to buy books like 1984  animal farm  nicomachean ethics  federalist papers  etc. basically books that are important to western civilization and liberty. Also getting them from Barnes and noble so I don t help Amazon.  Lol  I just noticed.  B amp N isn  39 t much better. Buy from a local bookstore if you can.  Sadly  All of them in my area have gone out of business. The only one left is my college bookstore which is B amp N.  Sadly many cities of even moderate size have nothing for new books except B amp N  Good idea because histrionic  amp  rabid Libs will continue on to acts in Fahrenheit 451.  Oh hey  I just ordered a used copy of that the other day    Why read the book when you are living it.  You will just spoil the ending.  who wants pdf version i can send link  I d love one   a href   u peensuck555  u peensuck555  a   I chuckled at your name  take my up vote   deleted   Everyone needs to read Ayn Rand s  Anthem  too.  I d argue it s better than 1984 because it portrays authoritarian governments as they actually are  completely impotent in terms of tech and standard of living.    This is a combination of 1984 and Brave New World.  It  39 s an important read for every adult. At least something good came from this madness.  Just purchased Animal Farm and 1984. Genuinely believe they could be pulled in the coming years.  Don t forget Huxley. Both Orwell and Huxley have been right so far. I recommend A Brave New World  Does BNW get better  I m around chapter 3 and I genuinely feel like I m dragging myself through it even though I usually really like dystopian books  It s kinda bland in all honesty. Nothing super compelling  but the ideas it proposes are. Try an audiobook if you can t get into it. YouTube has free ones. That s what I did  Oh dang  it seemed like it could have just been all the exposition that was getting me down. I ll give the audiobook a try though   For sure. Read all of these  even in high school not too long ago  just never owned them. Also good to have them in physical copy rather than electronic  Along with Fahrenheit 451...  Instead of being pulled I imagine having the next generation not read them is a very real possibility. If my teachers hadn t put those two books in my hand I don t know if I ever would ve read them.  Not even kidding I m doing the same  In the way we re heading anything s possible.  Me too. I feel the book burning is not far away.  They think it s an instruction manual.  I wonder if any stores moved it to nonfiction category.  All this censorship is truly frightening  and I see it mostly coming from the left. Now that the democrats are in power  censorship will only continue to grow  I wouldn t be surprised if they pulled these books from the public.  Or they  39 ll try to convince everyone that 1984 has a happy ending.  Also in the Fascist Playbook   burning books. Don t think for a second they can t take these books off the internet if it doesn t fit a narrative.  I am wondering if it is top selling because the left and tech companies need a how to guide refresher.  If you haven t read it yet  don t. It s terrifying.  I  39 m not planning to  what  39 s the point if we  39 re already living it   I was actually considering purchasing Rules for Radicals myself.  I would buy this book  but I  39 ve read it like 3 times... and the world is getting to be more like  quot Brave New World quot  instead.    Huh. Pelosi is the pig   That s animal farm but still relevant.  Didn  39 t the farmer feed the pig lots of expensive ice cream   Democrats purchasing instruction manuals.  Ironic.  1984   2021  May be more like Starship Troopers by the time this is all done  No kidding. Endless pointless wars to enrich the political elite  soon to be removed from amazon and audible  I just bought my father in law a copy of Animal Farm for Christmas. He had never read either that or Animal Farm and after a late night of talking politics one night he found a copy of 1984 and breezed through it. So I figured he might as well have animal Farm too.  I bet Amazon is about ready to ban it.   deleted   ALL OF THEM COMMITTING SUICIDE ...

It  39 s been both funny and scary to watch the shit they are posting lately. This seems like some of their stuff. There is one making the rounds on the far right now about how Apple is going to to an iOS update to remove the emergency alert system from phones because that is how Trump will be communicating with the country once the military action begins. I  39 m serious. They are out there talking about that shit right now.  I did get an alert that there will be an update on my iPhone tonight.  Pretty sure they can  39 t remove the EAS.  They can do what they want because they re a private company.  s  Does anyone mind explaining this to me   More manufactured political violence  more censorship  more of the left pretending their riots didn  39 t burn down city blocks and kill dozens of people.   quot FBI  who has a history of framing Republicans  plants excuse for rounding up Trump supporters and increased censorship on the Internet. quot    removed   The FBI sure do love writing fanfiction.   removed

t3_kur2zz,In Poland Social Media Companies Censoring A Post Could Be Fined 2 Million,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kur2zz/in_poland_social_media_companies_censoring_a_post/,Eastern Europe knows a thing or two about totalitarians and their propaganda methods.  You know me personally  being born in Slovakia  which belonged for decades under communist rule  am feeling terribly disturbed by the amount of censorship going on in USA. For ages here in Eastern Europe the USA was the bastion for democracy and free speech  we were all incredibly jealous of you. But the recent events is really really scary and I actually fear for your country. I definitely don t want to live under China we all prefer much more USA. Be strong my friends  I hope the division in your country will decrease and that you will become stronger because of it. But I worry it might not be the case  My mom and her siblings grew up in USSR controlled Ukraine in a poor Christian family. And they had to hide their bibles so well incase the KGB came. To me that  39 s not that bad  what  39 s she told me that is the scariest is that NO ONE spoke out against the government or openly said they were a Christian for fear of being put in jail  beaten  or in some cases even disappear.   But I thought Democrats were the one  em saving  em  us from fascism   It  39 s a misleading headline. If you read more  it  39 s actually a negative move by the current authoritarian leaning government party to force government regulations on private businesses. I suggest reading a few more articles.   It  39 s depressing to me that you  39 re being downvoted bc you aren  39 t spreading misinformation like others. I appreciate you adding context.  Its fine   to be honest most of the disinformation is just lack of context   if you don  39 t live there you only get the headlines and a few paragraphs  so you  39 ll only get one or two sources and likely never see it again.  Fair enough. Thank you for the insight  No problem   it  39 s a muddy issue and there  39 s a lot of disinformation   in general I don  39 t think government regulations of private businesses fall in line with conservative values  You mean there is mass disinformation in a country that forces platforms to allow conspiracy  falsehood  and out right lies to be propagated or face fines  Color me surprised.  Getting downvotes for your post is the equivalent of the dipshits in this community shoving their fingers in their ears and going  lala I can t hear you    Let s just say Poland is familiar with suppressing ideologies.    39 LGBT free zone.  39   especially Poland     Yeah  they  39 re turning towards it again. Hello Hungary   People on Parler or Twitter would be clobbered by fines if they lives in Poland. They ban hate speech over there.  Parler should host from Poland. Krakow has a big tech hub.  The sword cuts both ways though. From the article   I  39 d agree. Terrorist material is pretty vague  given what happened in the US and how the term domestic terrorism is so loosely thrown around. However pedo shit and suicide is pretty cut and dry  and this seems to be a step in the right direction.  Yeah  however free speech is a tricky subject. Look the first big one that really came up on reddit and change its direction  the jailbait subreddit.  That s an actual sub  I m scared to even check because it s so disgusting   It was banned many years ago.   Yeah  I can see that.   So is free speech basically dead or on its way out everywhere in the world now   Poland has hate speech laws  so it would last about 10 minutes.  Nah us Europeans kinda don  39 t want anything to do with your politics in our land....figure your own shit out  Odd... Europe always wants the US on its side when Russia gets uncomfortable  or when there is a natural disaster.  Poland is the Silicon Valley of Europe  So you  39 re saying use a VPN and set location to Poland   Have to be a Polish national I  39 m afraid to get them fined.  So your saying maybe Chicago too   s  Would that let people get around the  quot flaired users only quot  blocks and or post endless bot spam   They got taken over by the Nazis and The commies. When they say never again they mean it.  Don  39 t forget Prussia Austria Imperial Russia taking a crack at it in the past too.  They have kept the refugees out  banned most abortions  and will fine a social justice warrior factory  2M for censoring.  The gun laws are loosening there as well. Concealed carry and now they are loosening up on cartridge restrictions.  They  39 re soon out of EU if tgey continue their path. Too bad they rely on EU money...  Gun laws are a national competency. See the Czech Republic as an example.  Czech...yeah...The gold standard of EU  There is no way to kick out an EU member state. With Hungary supporting them  there s no way to strip their voting rights too.  They  39 re following Czechia.  Makes you wonder far all of this goes back   Just..dude Poland is not the role model you should be holding up right now. I thought conservatives were against communism.  Very sadly  the sub won  39 t care what you say...     Its just weird how these countries that were actualky oppressed by a totalitarian regime not too long ago are really big on this whole freedom thing.  It  39 s a misleading headline. If you read more  it  39 s actually a negative move by the current authoritarian leaning government party to force government regulations on private businesses. I suggest reading a few more articles.   I live here too and it  39 s hilarious seeing people think our country is a bastion of freedom or something of the sort.  Tell me about it lmao. I do think Poland needs change but not the change PiS wants   We re totes free  Now hold my judicial system     PiS in a nutshell  Businesses can  39 t just do whatever they want. That  39 s why there  39 s minimum wage laws  wrongful terminations laws  harassment laws etc. When a company gets so big it becomes bigger than the government then rules need to be put in place.  Ok  that  39 s a fair viewpoint.  Minimum government intervention is very good but are you OK with being under the complete rule of thumb of a corporation  Imagine having to obey a corporations rules or you won  39 t be able to get a job  get a loan  travel etc. That  39 s what  39 s happening right now.   quot Really big on freedom quot  except you can get arrested for badmouthing religion.  Who knew we could learn from Poland when it comes to the 1st amendment  Former communist countries generally tend to do a lot better than us at sensing danger.   You know a thing or two when you ve seen a thing or two   You have to understand that our current generation of 20 something socialists communists in the U.S. is far smarter and has much more wisdom than any previous generation  they know exactly what to do to make socialism communism work for the betterment of humankind. It will finally be the Utopia the left has always wanted. All the other failures of socialism communism  like very low quality of life  killing of dissidents  oppression by the government  etc.  were due to how dumb the people were  not because socialism communism is a crazy pipe dream that always leads to economic ruin and the slaughter of innocent people.  Had me in the first half.  Lmao nice one  They also aren t riven with division and racial witch hunts caused by multiculturalism.  You guys literally don  39 t understand the first ammendment its actually incredible.  Thank you  It  39 s only ok to refuse when it goes against their beliefs. The cake shop can refuse a gay couple and Kim Davis can refuse to give out marriage licenses and both are heroes.  Ok  I view conservative values as desiring less government regulations so perhaps we will not agree. Thanks for the reply though   I don  39 t think you understand what you  39 re saying. The worst of Parler wouldn  39 t last a minute under Poland  39 s comprehensive hate speech laws.  You really can  39 t. If you want to learn from Poland towards the 1st ammendment then you would take over state nd public media  use it for propaganda and call any source of criticism a paedophile. Fire judiciaries at will and make it illegal for them to criticise other appointees. Sure they have freedom of speech so long as it is the right speech that they approve of.  Might be time to head home to the motherland.  We shouldn  39 t run when tyranny makes it move. We need to stay and fight it. Conservatives need to get clever. We can  39 t post on theses forums anymore  we need to decentralize communication as fast as we possibly can  and form political action groups. Now.   Used to have a low opinion of Eastern bloc countries but I was wrong. They are actually the last bastions of traditional values left in Europe. Modernized 1st world western countries are now just degenerates. A soft life breeds fools  I moved from the west to an eastern block country  and let me tell you  it  em feels so good.  em   Is crime decreasing these days   Yeah. Mafia crime is on the down and down  murders being regularly solved  very low petty crime  I ve never heard anyone get mugged here  even when walking in alleyways at 2am  whereas many of my friends back west have been .  Sounds like the life bro   THEY remember what communists afflicted them with  God bless Poland and Hungary  last bastions of Europe  You can tell which country understands the most about leftism.  No substitute for experience with those motherfuckers.  It  39 s a misleading headline. If you read more  it  39 s actually a negative move by the current authoritarian leaning government party to force government regulations on private businesses. I suggest reading a few more articles.   I guess we  39 re screwed no matter where we try to go.  Poland showing us how the first ammendment works.  Conservatives praising government stepping in to check private corporations  As someone on the far left  I am happy to see this      Free speech lives somewhere  at least.  Not in Poland it doesn  39 t  It definitely doesn  39 t live in this subreddit.  Why is Poland so based  In Poland  they put you in jail for waving a rainbow flag.  How is Poland with immigration  Is it easy to migrate there for a job  USA and most of Europe will have fascist takeovers in the next 10 years. The Democrats could have 2 3rd majority in most states. And the constitution maybe unrecognizable.  you won  39 t like their salary pay scale   D  Ok. Can I plan to retire there   I am pretty sure you do. Language is the most complex in European countries  but yours usd will be valuable there.   At this point I don  39 t care for an agreeable society. Just a society that will leave me alone. Looks like the polish have at least some setup for this. I  39 m hoping that it will be immune from George Soros 20 years from now. But that is doubtful     go to Hungary then  they really hate him there    Good suggestion. Thank you.  Any country George boogeyman Soros doesn  39 t have a vested interest in is reasonably okay  Hopefully they re prepared for an onslaught of Russian trolls and disinformation. Will be Ukraine all over again.  At what point do we say that people need to moderate what they  39 re reading and use their critical thought   Yes  I agree  that is certainly a valid approach and has its own pros and cons. On the internet  laws like this create an arms race for bots and troll farms. Social media sites can quickly be flooded with disinformation by whichever party seeks to influence a situation most. In Poland s case they are squeezed between the EU and Russia  and Russia would love to spread disinformation unimpeded to the Polish electorate and install Russian friendly legislatures just like they did in Ukraine.   It  39 s not going to work though. Combine bots with something like GPT 3 and all the threads are literally flooded with texts indistinguishable from what a person would write. This would completely kill discussion boards like reddit.  No it won t. Ukraine has a Russian minority population that literally wants to be annexed by Russia  where s pretty much everyone in Poland hates Russia. Not comparable at all  Nice  I think Krakow is on my visitation list.  Never thought I d imagine emigrating from the US.  Don  39 t go to Krak w  too touristy IMO. Hit up Wroc aw  Prague isn  39 t too far if you want to visit there too  or Gda sk if you prefer the ocean.  I ll consider it.  Maybe Warsaw too.  You guys really shouldn  39 t take current Poland as a rolemodel  we  39 re becoming complete shithole under the rulership of PIS.  Too bad this law doesn t apply to USA  It  39 s going to take actions like this to get anything done. We  39 ve lost the government in America. Our DNC overlords will never do anything against their tech partners.  lul saying anything about poland  like it isn  39 t going down the authoritarian path  i know that i live here.  Come on guys make your mind up. Do you want private companies to have more or less power   Less political power.  It is so sad that our voices are being silenced. This is the country that was founded on freedom and we are having our voices taken away.  Conservatives praising government stepping in to check private corporations  As someone on the far left  I am happy to see this      I would bet that we see a reform of social media within the next 6 months. They can t allow this to happen. This is all a ply on the president before the 20th. After that they ll let it go.  Hey guys  pretty cool to see a non flair required post around here  Pretty smart to do it for this particular content.    I really don t mean this to sound how it s going to sound  but doesn t that mean that subreddits like this one would be a legal hellhole to support for users in Poland   Here though  So... you re asking for more governmental regulation   Government regulation is why these companies are so powerful in the first place. The only option is to fight fire with fire.  They  39 re also no longer a proper functioning democracy. The ruling PiS party bullies journalists with fines and lawsuits and forced a  strong third of their supreme court  strong  into retirement. In 2018 they adopted a censorship law that makes it illegal to implicate Polish involvement in the Holocaust.  Yes  exactly. Thank you that someone understands the current situation  Y all realize that the Polish policy entails the government compelling a private company to publish speech  right  The stronger first Amendment position is the current policy in the US  where the government doesn t have that power. Just so we re clear on what is  pro first amendment  here.  Good  then move to Poland.  So pack up your shit and go to Poland. Then you  39 ll have nothing to cry about. Easy.  I wonder if they would allow a terrorist to make claims of an attack on social media. That s basically why Twitter and all the others did what they did. They don t want racism or attacks on america to get posted. It s pretty simple. Does it hurt their freedom of speech to no longer be allowed to spew their hatred  yes  Good. Is it illegal  No. These companies can do whatever they want to and ban whoever they want to for whatever reason they want to. First amendment has nothing to do with being allowed to post hatred for America on your page.  Time for everyone 2 get a polish account  This is the only non flair required post I can find in the top ten. Like many other left leaning but more central Redditors ive observed this sub for a while.   Ahh Poland  the bastion of Democracy and Freedom  Funny because of how this sub operates  The question is  do we have to go through what Poland did to get to this point  Are we at the beginning of a extremely frightening half century of oppression   Poland continues to impress me.  Parlor should just set up their own locations.  It d probability be cheaper than what they pay Ama on.  It will always be weird to me the way people pick and choose when we can use other countries as an example of how we should run ours. Have you seen their gun laws  They might get this one right but by and large they are a shit show lol  Based Poland  Let  39 s hope some thing comes from all this that shows both sides how important 1A actually is.  In other news    a href   r conservative  rel  nofollow   r conservative  a  users rail against impingement on their freedom of speech in flaired only posts with zero sense of irony  Now this is something I could get behind. Hmm.  We know a thing or two because we ve seen a thing or two  So sad  big state deciding over private companies in their rules...

I understand that it isnt a protected class   but shouldn  39 t it be  We grant political asylum for citizens of other countries while simultaneously allowing citizens to  quot cancel quot  other citizens because they believe differently than one another.   I agree with you in principle  but it  39 s clear that the framework in which free and open discourse can occur has been deliberately upended in order to make ideological differences appear  em existential  em . The promotion of such concepts of speech as violence   quot hate speech quot   and so on have insured a situation where not only are  em verboten  em  beliefs and speech  as defined by self positioned social gatekeepers  punishable as existential threats  allowing room for the expression of those beliefs becomes a punishable threat in itself. Censorship and cancellation have become virtues. This wasn  39 t accidental.  Also the usage of nouns to dehumanize people  so that you don  39 t have to consider their opinion  because you no longer  I guess on a subconscious level  think of them as people. The right does this  leftist   but not nearly as much as the right  Trumpists  covidiots  hicks  etc.  fly over country  it goes on and on .  If half of America is cheering that parler was deplatformed then it s only a matter of time until they cheer the government doing the same. If the freedom to say what what s on your mind becomes  violence  and the government and apple are justified in preventing you from speaking  we are lost.  Interesting to see the responses from around the world about this issue. Kinda gives me some hope that leftists in other parts of the world appear to stick by their principles  wtf is wrong with them in the US   Facts this country try is fucking sad right now

t3_kv7dl0,Twitter Hasnt Suspended These Accounts That Openly Incite Violence,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv7dl0/twitter_hasnt_suspended_these_accounts_that/,Twitter   quot Oh this death to america tweet is perfectly fine. quot   It  39 s why what they are doing is so blatantly obvious. They make their claims and then it  39 s incredibly easy to go find countless high profile situations where Twitter didn  39 t follow their own rules.  Love the non flaired brigaders trying to comment on this one.  Honestly if Twitter just came out and said  we re banning right wing accounts because we don t like it   no one would be mad.    They can  39 t though because they would be declaring themselves publishers.  They re declaring themselves publishers anyway when they ban the president and lie about him inciting violence  while allowing Slate to say violence is explicitly ok  I agree. It  39 s obvious to everyone yet the media continues to gas light.  All those media references to  far right Parler   in a sane world Twitter would always be described as  hard left activist network Twitter .  This is why they need to lose 230 protection.  It is fine if they as a private company want to ban people according to their own rules. When they don  39 t apply those rules evenly though  it shows they are picking and choosing what they will allow. That is called being a publisher.  A bunch of hypocrites who can  39 t handle mean tweets. They  39 re so sensitive.   No it didn  39 t and no it won  39 t.  Antifa routinely uses both Twitter and Facebook to stage violent actions  without penalty.  The violence isn  39 t an issue for tech  the ideology is.  We  39 d do well to move on.  Twitter and Facebook want echo chambers.  Let them have them.  It isn  39 t as though conservatives aren  39 t used to mainstream censorship.  And yet  the ideology endures and will continue to.

Just sell houses.  Why does every damn sector of society need to get involved in all of this    Millennials have caused this. They got in to the work force and have demanded that the places they work be as woke as they are.  Who taught the millennials to behave that way   Their teachers mostly. We let them be indoctrinated all through the education system. This is a group that grew up being told how special they are and how much their feelings matter and that anything that makes them uncomfortable is a hate crime.  Apathetic parents. Too lazy to talk to their kids about politics.  My favorite was the quiet change to call Master Bedrooms and Baths  quot Primary quot  now instead. Lol... Were people really triggered by that   Soon  you won  39 t be able to buy or sell a house  rent an apartment  unless you agree with the Party.  Guess I  39 m just moving off the grid.

t3_kuryp2,Florida teacher arrested for allegedly spraying disinfectant at students who didnt wear masks properly faces felony child abuse charges,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuryp2/florida_teacher_arrested_for_allegedly_spraying/,Because a normal person totally does something like that...  As if it wasn  39 t bad enough  she was apparently teaching a class for learning disabled students.  I live in the general area and life is basically normal here except you are expected to wear a mask when you go into a store etc. I guess you could technically refuse and get away with it but virtually nobody bothers anymore.  I  39 ve seen plenty of employees in back rooms going about their business without masks though.  Yep this is how it is for me in GA. Most places are open  even for dine in. They just try to space people out a bit and require a mask when walking around. Only exception I can find is Gyms don  39 t require masks to use  but require a temp check  and they have really tried to space people out on top of being kinda serious for wiping the machines benches down.  Ohio is completely up to the district. Mine has been doing hybrid and we are back in person next week.  Kids here have been attending school in person since August. It  39 s been mostly uneventful  and Florida is right in the middle of the pack in terms of case rates.  As they should be.  Which part   This teacher could potentially face a punch in the throat as well.  I hate teachers who do shit like this and giggle about it.  Honestly I hate most teachers.  People think back fondly of the 3 great teachers they had growing up and forgot that they had about 40 that ranged from adequate to absolute shit.  So true. But the three great ones were SO good  and so life changing  and so much more worth remembering. But the rest were lame  insecure  abusive  immature  and stupid.  My favorite teacher in high school was amazing. Supported every kid  engaged with the disengaged kids  me  and was just all around awesome. He was black and most of my school was Hispanic native white. He basically hates white people now  and anyone who isn  39 t super progressive. It  39 s really hurtful and sad.  What  39 s funny is I only remember maybe 10 teachers at all. ie I couldn  39 t even name or picture many more than that. lol. And don  39 t really remember more than 1 or 2 who I thought were that great. One was clearly some racist black woman  though.  then the one good one I remember right off was black and not racist.  p  .  Even my best teacher  the one that really got me excited about going to class  I realize now was very friendly to socialism and he also dated a student the year after she graduated lol  lol. well at least that is legal  although most people would frown on it.  Legal but wildly inappropriate. But  teachers unions.  I had a lot of good teachers  I only really remember the bad ones. The worst was my 8th grade math teacher who did nothing but start the class saying we were all worthless sacks of human garbage and do that the entirety of the period every day for both semesters.   lol. I didn  39 t have any that bad. Just a few slightly cranky ones. I had one teacher who got driven to a nervous breakdown by students  though  which was sad.      Teachers are mostly failures.   It is just me or does she look like the  a href  https   i.ytimg.com vi oXmgU aY NI maxresdefault.jpg  Heaven  39 s Gate  a  dude   The same wide eyed look of insanity.

Covid is a mental disease as well as viral one  The mental part is a common symptom of TDS.  Hysteria rules the day.  Unfortunately  I went to a liberal arts college not for the beliefs but because they had the major I wanted. There was tons of pandering and things thrown at students including myself.   Friend of mine in college got an F on a presentation because he did it on Saudi Arabia sponsoring terrorism . A Saudi kid started yelling at him that he was lying . He took it up with the department chair and won  because nothing in his report was untrue.  I  39 m sure we all had teachers that would do this kind of shit. They  39 re usually super anal about everything and in their own little world.  Just because other teachers could do shitty things does not she mean she should not be protected.  Reminds me of the  quot Florida man quot  memes lmfao  Jesus Chrisssssttt    Good. She even looks like the type.  I recognize it too.

But we all know Acosta would lob him softballs and it would be even more apparent how hypocritical the network is  hence this move   quot Regarding what  39 s going on right now  Mr President  what is your favorite dinosaur  quot   Biden is his own favorite dinosaur  Don  39 t you make fun of him  He  39 s a Civil War hero    Is it a T Rex  Guys  it s a T Rex  So cool   He says a Biden stares into space and starts drooling.  You mean slob them soft balls like the Democrat stooge he is.  So is this a promotion or a demotion  Because Mr look at me  I m Jim Acosta Surely wouldn t be as combative with a liberal president. No.  What delighted and enchanted you about your first year as president  Obama    Trump made his career  Trump made his career  a joke   there ya go    Remember Obama ignored the whitehouse press like the plague...  Couldn t have happened to a nicer guy.  sup   sup s  sup   sup   It  39 s not like Biden will actually let the press ask him unscripted questions.  The press will only ask soft questions like  President  Biden  can you talk more about your dog    Man Jim had a lot of cringe moments the past four years  They should send Acosta to cover the protest in some state capital on the 50th...

t3_kup7ax,Citibank says it will not support candidates who do not respect the rule of law and will pause contributions to the GOP members who objected to certifying Bidens election.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kup7ax/citibank_says_it_will_not_support_candidates_who/, quot Just build your own international banking system. quot   This kind of already has been done  cryptocurrency.  I knew this would happen but I figured it would take a little while...  How long before anyone associated with conservatives or Republicans are not allowed to access any banks at all    removed    removed    removed    removed    removed    removed    removed   Dark times ahead  Buy BTC ETH fuck a bank  If BTC gets mainstream it  39 s going to be banned and outlawed before you can spell  quot p a r l e r quot .  Chase and PayPal banned Laura loomer 3 years ago  Oh  I wouldn  39 t be surprised it that happened in the next 92 hours...  Or buy guns or anything that isn  39 t approved by IMF and Globalists.  So you re telling me I ll be able to trust those politicians more since they ll be receiving less money from special interests.  I think it is a win  If only they would do it for all politicians.  But objecting to the certification is in the law... And this isn  39 t even unusual. The Dems objected in 2000  2004 and 2016.  So we need to start sending the lists of Dems who did this shit to the companies having a meltdown  yeah   Definitely  Where s the list of Dems  and the EECB email list for Citibank   Shit  39 s Orwellian in the least.  This should be top comment  and should be first response to anyone who makes this dumb point that objecting to certification of electoral votes is some sort of great crime.  Yea pelosi has objected before.   Asking to investigate an election is illegal now   Crying  quot election fraud quot  is ONLY acceptable if you are a Leftist.  Wait and the left says you can change and everyone has to respect it else they lose there woke badge   Where were the banks when Democrats objected to electors for both Trump and Bush  Hmmm   Both Bushes  Thanks. I thought so  but was too lazy to double check. I couldn  39 t remember if it was both Bushes or W both times.  It is entirely constitutional to object to an election certification.  The problem here is you think the left cares about the Constitution.  Jokes on them  we  39 ll all be broke due to hyper inflation soon anyway  And lockdowns.  DO NOT COMPLY   When are conservative companies going to start throwing their weight around  If we re playing this game  I m happy to change my spending habits.  Corporations only hire you if you have a degree in any positions of power.  People with degrees now days are woke college kids with blue hair.  All companies leadership is liberals.  Are there any   I really think the only way the other side gains any momentum is some gigantic company or ultra wealthy speak out or help. Like Elon Musk or something. IDK  I think it  39 s pretty hopeless barring an actual civil conflict  Elon  39 s use signal tweet has had a pretty big impact. He  39 s openly giving the finger to Facebook.  There are no conservative companies or liberal companies. Companies only care about what makes them money. If conservative politics makes them money  they  39 re conservative. If liberal outrage loses them money  they  39 re liberals.  Idk  but it needs to start soon.  So the Democrat party is officially the party of Wall St and the big banks.  Ironic.  have been for a long time  Both are and both always have been. Wall St and big banks donate to politicians on both sides of the aisle.  Citibank has actually been doing this stuff for a while. Look at all the people that got Trump elected back in 2016  they were pretty much purged.  I have similar feelings. I m furious with the GOP.  CC companies should have no right to forbid any legal transactions.  The banks smell blood now too   I ve used Citibank for almost two decades. Looks like I ll be closing all my accounts with them this week.  Make sure you let them know why   removed   What about the dems who objected to Trump and Bush   Memory holed  Amen.  That  39 s literally part of the law...  Since it is safe to say federal Democrats will not object given the extent to which it aligns with their politics  I guess it is time for Republican AGs to start throwing around their weight.  Last I checked  objections are part of the rule of law.  Good to know the morons in citi Bank dont know that objecting is 100  legal and in the constitution   removed   Their actions say that yes  they sure do.  This is fucking absurd.  Citibank doesn t exactly have a  rule of law  reputation from the past if my memory serves me well.  Again  none of this would be an issue  if they couldn  39 t donate in the first place  How about if they don  39 t support any of them and just stick to banking rather than buying our politicians   shittibank  And then quietly restart them next year as they ve done for decades.  Umm.. the constitution literally is the highest law in the land... how is following this document not respecting the rule of law again   Kind of funny all these big corporations suddenly care about law and order  They didn t seem worried when their buildings were being looted by the  law abiding left  and the crew encouraged it.  Quotes from around the sub that are super relevant in this topic for sure     If everyone s pausing donations to republicans all this means is that republicans won t be held back by corporate interests and less corruption in the gop. We might start seeing true conservatives.  The irony I guess is that Trump and everyone objecting was following  quot the law quot .  Let s not forget that this election was stolen  and Trump voters have a right to be mad  protest and object.  Citibank was Obama  39 s cabinet. Ironic they accuse others of not respecting the rule of law.  Seven months of rioting and looting from Anita and BLM and it  39 s only now that they concern themselves with the rule of law.  Another card to cancel. Bye CitiCommunist   Chase did something similar last year if I recall.  I thought of this tonight but couldn  39 t remember the exact verse. Thank you.  Did they contribute to the Dems that objected to Trump s certification   So I guess the Dems are shit out of luck then..  Man... if this shit backfires all these companies will be fucked. Righteously fucked.  They won t  Josh Hawley thanks you for your inkind donation

Since when is it a radio podcast company  39 s job to  quot induce calm quot  into the country  Their job is to talk about the news  and election fraud is news. The job of keeping the country calm is on the politicians and right now with trying to force the President out  they don  39 t seem to be interested.  Will see over the next couple weeks which of the hosts are truly principled and who are in it for the money.  They tell us to stand strong in support of Trump and all of the hypocrisy of the left  now we  39 ll see which of them are willing to take action rather than just talk tough.  Truth.   Bongino just lost his ass on his Parler investment  he  39 s battling cancer and I  39 m pretty sure his podcast hosts are threatening to cancel on top of being demonetized on YouTube  canceling his Twitter and now you want him to give up his talk radio revenue stream  He  39 s also running a news aggregate site  is invested in Rumble and contributes to Fox News. He  39 s has a lot on his plate right now and he  39 s by no means filthy rich. And god knows how much money Rush has burned through with his cancer treatments.  Rush can afford several life times of cancer treatments. Idk about Dan Bongino  though. I want them both well  and am so not wanting to let Rush go.  Limbaugh net worth is  650 million and earns  83 million annual salary.  If I remember correctly from the days of Obama care when he discussed health care costs he said he self insured. At a minimum he could cover 1000  lifetimes of lung cancer treatments.  Yeah  I was never concerned about him financially being unable to cover costs.  Cumulus is a bunch of fascists  They should all leave.

But then again Yale did change Calhoun College to Hopper College  You would think the left would be against such a thing. They pay their lives away trying to get this piece of paper. Now imagine the school can say  quot thanks for paying your tab  but even that  39 s not a guarantee  we can still revoke even after you  39 ve paid. quot    quot Oh no my Feminst Dance Theory diploma has been revoked  how will I keep my place as Feminst Dance Specialist in Gender Studies factory  quot   Oh  definitely  they  39 re the best at getting degrees that are absolutely worthless. But now just imagine not only getting a worthless degree that won  39 t land you a job  but now paying out the ass for the school to revoke it. Thus effectively  you wrote a  500 000 check to the school for even less than that already worthless piece of paper.  Protest the town he was born in to revoke his birth certificate so he  39 s now an undocumented immigrant.  s  But then they would have to support him and vie for his vote   Cancel culture at its finest  The rabbit hole of cancel culture knows no bounds.

Oh yeah  it s apparent.  The leftists and Democrats have intentionally been creating the conditions for the perfect storm for over 12 years. The meteorologists in this case being law enforcement of course had very good reason to believe that this storm would hit DC.  Based on the unrest and anger being directed at our government  it makes logical sense that the Capitol City would be ground zero. What wasn  39 t known was the who  where  and how.  This sounds like the blame game  What do you mean KNEW  Did they anticipate  or did they have some sort of foresight   Somebody was mentioning that if they  the capitol police  really thought there was a threat that they have the man power on their own to provide a deterrent and mentioned something like 2000 officers  The 3 er s were talking about storming the capital for weeks publicly  Events like this don  39 t happen in a vacuum  this is a result of cause and effect. One only need to examine history and current events to see the powder keg growing before us. That keg was going to blow regardless of whether or not the FBI or DC Metro stepped in. If they arrested the organizers  it could  39 ve very well have been set off by the Left.   I mean it kinda happens anywhere that there is a fraudulent election to some extent.

Methinks St. Paul  39 s line in Romans 1 is appropriate here   Professing themselves wise they have become fools.

It is incredible isn  39 t it  And look how easy it is. They  39 ve managed to make the majority of people think folks with conservative opinions are evil and deserve less rights. Where will it end  I will not be surprised if they start killing conservatives and it  39 s seen as ok because  quot it  39 s ok to kill evil nazis quot . But the irony is they  39 re the evil nazis.  This is a hilarious joke right   Let  39 s keep focus on what  39 s actually happening in this article. Forbes is sayin that if you hire known prodigious liars  they will not take you seriously. Is that saying  quot people with conservative opinions are evil and deserve less rights quot   No... it  39 s not saying that at all... it  39 s saying that if you spend your career spouting demonstrable lies in front of cameras  people aren  39 t going to take you seriously.  When your people invade the capital to terrorize congress   Pre emptive libel.  Smart play  Forbes.  This should be remembered as the weekend that launched ten thousand lawsuits. It all comes down to we are banning  firing  harassing  or discriminating based off what you might do in the future.  And for what you believe in. I don t believe in socialism or communism. For that I can t get hired if I m on a list  This is Nazi Germany all over.  Oh come on  I  39 m about as left as you can get in America and I don  39 t believe in socialism and communism. What you  39 ve got there is a straw man. It  39 s only people directly related to the fomentation of the insurrection riot what have you being blacklisted. Violence is almost always unacceptable as a means to an end in domestic politics.  I do. I regularly call out when people in my political aisle call others Nazis when they are in fact just being authoritarian.  I  39 m a Democrat and I want no part of either socialism or communism. Neither of which would ever ever exist in our nation as it  39 s historically structured. It  39 s a myth  a lie and the sooner we can stop spreading the disinformation on this  the better. There is no communism or socialism coming to America for crying out loud. We  39 ve never been Communist or Socialist and we  39 ve had countless Democratic leaders in this nation. There is always a system of checks and balances and those hold true today. Only recently have we seen that system of checks and balances attacked and it was by Trumpism. This is not an autocracy.    I know  easy to swing a bit wide... like Arnold Dorknegger.  Can  39 t wait for the lawsuits.  When you shit the credibility bed  there are consequences. Imagine that.  This isn t libel  it s just Forbes telling people their opinion. Libel is about statements of fact.  These are wild times. Any historians out there  Has a country ever come back from this to return to freedom  I  39 m willing to take even a hint of evidence that we could return back to normal  and run with it. Because my heart is breaking into a million pieces right now.  Historically  You really don t want to know. Then again  the US has always been something of an exception but it s hard to say if that s due to relative age.  Has there ever been a country with this many checks and balances  Everybody in this sub needs to go read Federalist paper  10. It outlines how the constitution has safeguards in place for destructive factions  only if we remain a virtuous and moral society.  The Construction provided an excellent framework for a sustainable government that respects and promotes individual freedom.   US Constitution works only so long as people are willing to go along with it. US Supreme Court has already noted before that the Constitution is not a suicide pact. It means that if the existence of the Republic itself is in real danger  in order to protect the Constitution  you can sideline the Constitution in order to protect it.  I ve already seen people calling for the people that stormed the Capitol to be tried for treason and stripped of their citizenship. I can imagine the next step is  all Trump supporters  followed by  all conservatives.  It won t be hard for them  as they already have their lists made.  See  no. That s the kind of shit that s talked about on the other side of the extreme aisle   republicans are going to start knocking on our doors and if we didn t vote for trump are going to         . And it s bullshit there too. This is why we can t have nice things. Everyone assumes that if someone doesn t agree with them then they are the  other   and the other wants only one thing   your blood. So we have to destroy or be destroyed and that s exactly how that conversation starts right here. And it s just not fucking true.   Horseshoe theory.  Extremes on both sides are ridiculous and alike but represent only the minority.  They are just loud.  Unfortunately  the rest of us that to conflate those loud people on either side as representing the whole and it  39 s just so far from the truth.  Sucks that we have all been dragged into the poop flinging.  It helps to remember that many on the other side see only the most extreme of your own and are  rightfully  terrified.  Which leads them to taking extreme pre emptive action against them.  This of course makes THEM look evil crazy to the average Joe on your side because you never saw the crazy shit the people on the extreme end of your side said or did.  This constantly talking over each others heads has lead to both sides feeling like the victim and the other side looking crazy for claiming to be a victim.  Exactly. Please keep explaining this because more people need to hear it. I see so much of this and social media exacerbates it. Plus when you feel threatened and attacked by crazies  your natural reaction is to fight back to save yourself and save the country. Meanwhile people outside the US  both those who wish us well and those who don t  just look at us and shake their heads in amazement.  That  39 s not good news...  we aren  39 t a virtuous nor moral society  It all starts with the individual  I m going to do better.  I  39 ve probably read more on that topic than 99  of the population and that includes this sub. Then again  I have a bit of a leg up because of what I do for a living. That said  while I do believe the constitution to be a beautiful and deceptively well put together document  it still relies on the integrity and character of those putting it into practice. It  39 s also intentionally written in a way to be somewhat flexible thus allowing for competing interpretations.   Well  now instead of swords and guns we have weapons that can destroy the planet with a press of a button. So  not looking good if we can t come back.   removed   Cool. I was hoping for total societal upheaval and to lose all I  39 ve worked to hard for. As long as I get to see the country I love burn to the ground  it  39 ll all be worth it  SIGH. I couldn  39 t possibly be more sad right now.  You and me both friend. I wish you and yours the best during this prosperous time.  I  39 m not technically a historian  but I am a big history person  and...well...it ain  39 t looking good fam  Germany eventually came back to freedom...  Watching Germany deal with covid this year  i disagree. I don t know about their free speech laws... I feel that the USA is unique in its absolute and express commitment to free speech and I think losing it would be a loss for the globe.  Yeah  I wouldn  39 t call them   39 free  39  anymore. IIRC  they did pretty good for a while after the Berlin Wall came down.  Germany lost a war  the German state was dismantled  country occupied and new constitution and governmental structure setup in guidance and approval of the occupying forces.  The left is asking the same question while watching the right become Nazis in everything but name.  I miss living in a Republic.  It was nice.  So did the Romans. Don  39 t be fooled  at this current trajectory we  39 re going down the same exact path.  Yep. This is basically some combination of Rome around 100 BC   30 BC  Russia around 1915  and Germany around 1920   1935. You could probably sprinkle in some of what happened in some of the Central and South American authoritarian regimes but those worked a little more on outright force.  Those are three pretty bad times  yo. Not cool.  It  39 s honestly quite terrifying.  But this new place we re in has so many bananas   They generally only last a few centuries  see Rome.  Makes you think Jefferson was either warning or being prophetic when he made that statement about the tree of liberty.  But it s a democracy   s  You know what is more scary than what s happening now   It s what liberals are saying  em SHOULD  em  happen.  I saw a post about the DC mayor asking for permits to be denied for protests around the Inauguration  and made a comment that the March for Life is around that time and people should be aware that it has nothing to do with Trump Biden directly so don  39 t confuse the marchers with Trump supporters and get confrontational  Nick Sandman  anyone  . The reply was  quot Toxic religious groups should go the way of Trump and his seditious mob. quot   It begins with this. Then people s voting history will be checked. Those who voted Trump or republican will get fired. That s just the first step. I ve seen it happen in my birth country  lol  the last thing they want for us to be able to do is to be able to trace every single ballot back to who cast it.  Lol like theyd let us have access to the database.  Let me make this crystal clear for those who need to know .. TRUMP           It s not about you having a database. It s about snitches. People can easily find out who most other people vote for after talking to them or their close confidants. I know people in my old neighbourhood in the old country who keep a list of their own of who they voted for  and they report their lists to the ruling party  mind you  in a multi party  democracy  .   That  39 s so sad. I  39 m glad you made it out and I hope things will turn out differently over here.  Thank you. That was years ago and I m fine now  it s just sad to see the communist revolution turning violent in America  You right.  Out of curiosity  where are you from  From my exposure to global politics this feels like post Soviet Russia. Were basically allowing corporations to dictate what party is on the right side of history and allowing members of that party to do horrible things in the name of progress. Which all just ends with having a defacto ruling class selected by the wealthy elites. Basically an oligarchy. I mean  the parallels between Putin and Biden are there. He usues government to enrich his family in private markets which the exert political influence.  I m from the former Yugoslavia  more specifically Montenegro  and I m also Canadian. In the former Yugoslavia things like this happened under the brutal socialist regime of Tito. I know the history well and everything I see happening in America looks like one big communist revolution that is quickly turning violent. Praying for America     This  I remember calls to end the secret ballot in the 2016 election as a means to pressure people to vote  quot the right way quot  and  quot hold them accountable quot . The authoritarians aren  39 t going to stop trying that now.  Even if ballots are kept secret  snitch lines will become all the more prevalent. Regular people will be doing the party s bidding by snitching on their friends  neighbours and even their own family. I personally know people in my home country who have done this for their ruling party  that s been in power since 1991 in a  democratic  country .  It s already happening. Cops are raiding people for gathering of more than six  based on  tips  from neighbors.   Yes  for covid. It will happen for voting and political leaning too  trust me  People have already been harassed for donating to trump and finding out what political party they re registered to. You can t see their votes but people assume anyways and that s enough to get them harassed and fired.  Wait until Google uses its camera cars to identify Trump signs in peoples yards while Amazon uses its delivery vehicles and drones to do the same. I wish I was joking.  Or until your credit cards start cancelling you because at some point you purchased a firearm ammo  donated to a republican  donated to the NRA  etc.  Geez  this is scary.  We can  39 t buy enough ammo at this point.  Don t listen to that comment  that is not real  The thing is  hopefully at least a small majority of people in government and businesses will realise that doing something like this will bring the wrath of about half the country. If businesses start firing people for their political affiliations and not work ethic or some other reason  then it would bring about tidal waves of lawsuits  as well as boycotts  meaning these businesses will lose half the country as potential customers  leading to a large loss of revenue. Same thing with government  a massive tidal wave of lawsuits  or worse if a large group of people are fed up. Doing anything like this would basically be shooting themselves in the foot.  Yup. This is the next steps. They will do a real audit and find all the trump voters and round um up   deleted   I  39 m fairly certain we  39 d still have some conservatives wringing their hands about optics and looking proper while they come to round us up lmao.  You  39 re absolutely right about that  and that  39 s scary.  Do 2 Trump votes cancel each other out   If this happens  they will be messing with half the country. I am an outsider looking in as well. I am deeply saddened by what has happened in the last year. These are dark days  but my fear is the days will grow darker. I  39 ve never felt a push in my own spirit like I do now to get away from the town in which I now live. I feel like just getting away from it all and creating a bit of shelter and a life for my kids.  I ve been thinking of going up north  past Timmins and living off the grid too lol crazy world we live in  We have a place in mind as well. 30 acres and then thousands of acres of crown land on 3 sides...   ..  Where r u from   Former Yugoslavia  Hahahahahahaha.  Soviet Pravda news likes your comment.  Insert Obama awarding Obama a Medal meme here.  Darn  how do I boycott a site whose content I stopped respecting years ago    deleted    removed    strong  em That is what the Left wants.  em   strong   And beat a cop to death with a flag  You  39 re right  appeasement and forgiveness without apologies is probably best for everyone.  Don  39 t do  em thing  em   or the terrorists will strike again.  Out of control  I  39 ve been less impressed with Forbes lately. They  39 re pandering to different groups and it seems political.  For all the moderates and the liberals   Only difference is we are the largest gun culture on the planet. It  39 s easy to bully and suppress the weak and defenseless.  Wtf are my guns going to do if they go after my means of making a living and supporting my family   That is correct. They are not coming for conservatives through violence  per se.   You should have thought about that before being a fascist  says the party of unity  It s been a decade of projection hasn t it.  Here they have barely grabbed power  even losing their margin in the house and the first thing they do is go full fucking fascist.  Yet Donny was given the perfect opportunity to do anything remotely fascist and the fucker decides  I m letting the states deal with this . He had the biggest opportunity for a power grab with this pandemic and nothing came of it. It s been nothing but projection.  100   Says the actual fascists  ftfy  I think  party of unity  has more of a sting to it as far as insults go. Very ironic  very bittersweet  This is the issue   the weak point for a gun toting culture  as with most conservatives  is the ability to provide  the ability to maintain fiscal independence. It s why I ve thought for a while it will be the conservatives who start the shooting   it ll be someone who lost their job and got publicly shamed in the town square for having the temerity to vote for Trump. It s the point where people have nothing to lose or don t think they have anything to lose or feel they ve been pushed into a corner. We re seeing more of those people spring up and this week s events are probably going to create more.  Not that it needs to be said here  but people need to pay very close attention to any proposed gun laws regulations restrictions etc.  because the left knows they won  39 t be able to come straight out and repeal the second amendment. Instead they will try to weaken it to the point that it  39 s too much of a burden  taxes  regulations  felony charges for defending your home family  etc.  to own a gun.  I think you are right.  They  39 ll probably focus more on certain areas of the US where there are more conservatives. I think a preview was when the mayor of Chicago blamed the governor of Mississippi for the gun deaths in Chicago.  Think about it  how can you dare to compare this to the Holocaust Nazi regime.  For all the moderates and liberals  China and the Pentagon   Military Industrial Complex have more power and pull with these companies than you ever will.  WE WILL HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE   removed   They want that to happen. It will just give them more justification to pass more legislation for  quot everyone  39 s safety quot .    39 Merica.  Fuck yea   So Forbes isn t interested in actually finding the truth...got it   quot Hello  my name is Joe McCarthy and I  39 d like to introduce you to some of our latest stories here at Forbes. quot   It s almost like they re trying to make people violent.  The gulag is always an option comrade.  Isn t the left wing media lying to the public everyday  Lmao. Jesus Christ.  The left continues to lose its mind.  Authouritarian bullshit at its finest.  Who gives a shit what Forbes thinks  Could you image if they did this for all politicians and their sycophants  Congress would surely enact a law making it illegal.  Works both ways.... we should all assume most media sources  I believe forbes  as well  are liars  since  you know.... they lied for years about trump.  Has someone started compiling a list of these blacklist writing bullies yet   I used to like Forbes. They  39 ve gone very far left the last 6 years.  Forbes forcefully endorsed Mitt Romney  all you need to know.  It  39 s like these people want an insurrection  My my  well if it isn  39 t the consequences of my actions...  So private companies excersising their right to choose customers...What should be done  We don  39 t want government controlling how businesses operate or do we   I mean this is the answer even if we don t like the result. Forbes can do whatever it wants.  Yeah this is sure to calm everyone down.  Post like these are a waste. Can we think for a second   We need to realize that trump destroyed our party. Not the dems  liberals  BLM  no  trump destroyed it. And all we can talk about is how it s going to be hard for trumps BFFs to get jobs. How about we focus on the senate in 2022   Making sure Georgia doesn t turn blue again   Let s get up  brush ourselves off and run a slightly  less trump  direction  It feels like we  39 re about 2 or 3 steps away from any Trump supporters being put into camps where they are tortured or killed.  Some really disturbing rhetoric flying around right now.  We may very well be witnessing the fall of America as a super power.  You think prejudice in getting a job is about 2 3 steps away from concentration camps and torture  Sweet jesus  get a grip.  Remember there is no section 230 for wastes of paper like Forbes.  It s funny how  a href   r conservative  rel  nofollow  r conservative  a  is complaining about Twitter banning trump  but yet they have all their posts tagged  flaired only   basically banning anyone from talking.  man this is major deja vu here... It  39 s almost like History is constantly repeating itself or something.  Remember when people thought Forbes was a libertarian outlet

Well at least he isn  39 t covering for pedophiles.. oh wait..  I m getting so tired of this. As a Catholic and a conservative  I think I speak for a lot of us that we are increasingly alienated from conservatives when the first comment is always  PeDoPhiLe PrIeST har har  or  whore of Babylon    There is no more rampant pedophilia in the Church than there is from teachers.  Less  I think.  there  39 s a ton of evidence showing that the current pope has his position because of the wing that  quot cares about the children quot  in the way that law enforcement frowns upon.  Ok. Now prove your claim.  He said theirs a ton of evidence. What more do you want     S   I have many Roman Catholic friends who can t stand this pope or Vatican II. They re part of the  Great Reset  machine and it s becoming more and more obvious  I really think there  39 s going to be another schism where Catholicism breaks into two branches   traditional and reform.  i prefer reform and liberal  but so it goes.  I have no interest in the latin mass but I  39 d appreciate a pope that doesn  39 t condone violent city burning riots  I didn  39 t have an interest in it either  but my wife became interested in TLM and our Parish has been offering one for more than a decade  so we started attending.  I  39 m a Catholic and have been planning on attending a TLM after covid. Quick couple of questions  if you don  39 t mind  do women truly need to veil for the Mass  Also does it need to be a lace veil or is starting with a scarf ok the first time I go   Many of the women do veil  my wife and daughter included  but I don  39 t believe it  39 s a requirement to veil  at least not at any of the Parishes I  39 ve attended the TLM at.  Thanks very much   A lot of us are fed up with Francis trying to claim the moral high ground while allowing corruption within the church to continue. Many  myself including  choose to ignore what this pope has to say since he clearly does not care for everyone  rather he only cares for people who think like the Marxist he is.  He has said such things as atheists could go to heaven  which were head scratchers  given his denomination.  He  39 s said a lot of outright heretical bullshit.  Im an atheist. I think the bible makes it perfectly clear where i would go. That  39 s a strange thing for a pope to say. Its not like im tempted to go to a Catholic church now  and it wouldn  39 t offend me  or make any difference  if he just stuck to what the book says and the believers believe. Very odd.  I could see someone who believes in God in general thinking it  but yeah based on his specific religion is what is confusing about his statement.  The book clearly says that hypothetically i would be going to hell. It wouldn  39 t offend me in the slightest if he just said that  nor would it scare me. Seems like he  39 s selling out for people that arent going to contribute to the church anyway.  And that is just one example of what he has said. He  39 s said some odd things.  I strongly dislike him. I don t know how he got chosen but I do not think he properly represents the values of the church.  I can attest  as a Catholic I don t like this Pope.  Roman Catholic here.  You just can t have what should be the spiritual leader of a billion people dropping in with hot takes on specific partisan issues like a Sociology student with their first Twitter account.  Yes.  Not sure how this guy was compromised.  They probably have his laptop as well.  He was a Marxist to begin with.  Blackmail seems unnecessary.  This commie asshole is NOT the favorite pope of most Catholics I know.  Adding this to the list of reasons I m a Protestant  Its crazy that even the pope was taken over by this wokeology. Where does it end  Bascially every 1st world country is infected by wokeness  Its disheartening to me and i dont even believe in the stuff    Benedict was much better. Forced to resign. Does that remind you of something   Heh. I thought he was supposed to lead people to Christ.  Im a good ole apostate but im pretty sure thats in the job description.  Jorge is OK with the killing of dozens and the injuring of thousands...just as long as his politics are the cause.  We tolerate him  sorta.  There are a  em lot  em  of Catholics who despise him and think he should be excommunicated.  This Pope  39 s more erratic than the Crusader Kings 2 pontiff  He s probably got as much money  gold  too.  Breaking  Another Pedophile enabler sides with leftists.  Evidence of Pope Francis s  pedophile enabling    Anyone who has risen to power in the Catholic Church has enabled pedophiles  and a lot of them.  Anyone who has risen to  power  in the Church has  em enabled  em  pedophiles  Any evidence for that claim   It s Reddit. You can t mention the world  Catholic  or any term remotely involving clergy without this knee jerk response. They re like trained seals with a fish in that regard. Best to let it slide  there s not any level of honest discussion to be had with people like that.  He was probably gaslit by the media  and didn  39 t see how violent the  quot protests quot  were.  I think if you  39 re a thought leader for a large number of people you have a responsibility to find out what  39 s going on before opening your mouth.  So you may be right  but I  39 m not inclined to excuse him if so.  Y all forget how old this dude is. What sort of news and media do you think he gets exposed to  Probably mainstream Italian news  and probably not much because I imagine being Pope is an incredibly time consuming career. He s not surfing the depths of the Internet for reality.  Fair  but I maintain that he shouldn  39 t talk when he doesn  39 t know what he  39 s talking about.  I don  39 t spout off about Italian politics  because I  39 m aware of my ignorance.  100  agree. The Pope in a weird spot right now where Church leadership thinks  modernizing  the church is how we get young people. In reality  embracing tradition is how we get youth but he s constantly pressured by Vatican leadership to speak on these identity politics issues. I hope the next Pope is someone like Cardinal Sarah  Ill weigh in as a non believer that grew up christian. It  39 d be far more appealing if the church stuck to its guns. Seeing a pope have this opinion is disturbing.  My faith and beliefs are catholic but the so called infallible acts of the Pope is horse shit.  Pope is only infallible when speaking  quot ex cathedra  quot  which happens very very rarely. And it  39 s always done on general matters of the religion  usually to clarify something.  Huh  He s not infallible when he speaks on American politics.  Idk how anyone can believe that any man is infallible.  We don t believe that any man is infallible  except for Jesus  but He sort of has the  being God  thing going for Him  too . Papal infallibility as a doctrine is more meant to express that no pope will formally commit heresy to doctrine in the Church. Papal infallibility is probably the most misunderstood doctrine of our faith  and it means WAY less than most people think it does.  Nothing about the doctrine of papal infallibility implies that you must agree with everything a pope says   it merely means that he will not formally make heresy into doctrine.  As a Catholic  I would like to apologize for the Communist shithead that currently has a pointy hat.  The Catholic Church has had plenty of Popes who were not truly virtuous or pious men in the past when shit like the inquisition was torturing Jews into confessions or they were calling for massive invasion forces from all of the Christian kingdoms to fight the Arabs. No reason to think every Pope in the modern era will also be a true Christian. This pope is a globalist pawn it s pretty obvious at this point.  You wanna throw gas on the Q dumpster fire  Have the head of the largest organized child trafficking ring in the world condemn them. This will not help  given the Catholic church s history.  Can we get Benedict back   He stuck with religious matters more than trendy social  liberal  talking points.  Evil in the world today is the same as it was centuries ago  but it is enriched by unwritten rules of the new world  equipped financially and technically  which has unprecedented information and communication possibilities.  Rosenberg is a domestic terrorist   gt   Rosenberg is a board member of BLM   gt   The Pope is in favor of domestic terrorism.  This Pope is a Communist.  Fuck the Pope.  Catholic church is a joke  Of course he stands with the left. Just like the Hollywood and rich Democrat elites  the pope condones raping children.  Is there video of him speaking  Rumors and conspiracy theories keep floating that he was arrested  Those would appear to be completely false if he s been seen giving speeches  Or was this a written statement   He hasn t been arrested. I don t think I ve seen a crazier conspiracy theory environment then today. There s so much crazy shit floating around  it s insane.  Censorship seems to contribute to it   It  39 s coming from the gateway pundit.  Fuck the Pope.  I wonder how Catholics are taking this..  I don  39 t do religion so it  39 s easy for me to just call the dude a shit bird and move on.  Damn. I  39 m atheist and I can  39 t even believe the Pope is saying this. Society is so fucked.  What a piece of shit.   deleted

These people need to be able to be held accountable  Came by to say exactly this.  So  about that picture of Mrs. Pelosi knelling in support of BLM.  Headline should read   Pelosi chokes up when she realizes that the people have all the power  and this country was founded on the blood of aristocracy   She choking up only because she knows that her laptop and all of her incriminating files on it were stolen.  She must have selectively forget the ones who stormed the capitol during the Kavanaugh hearings. Because those looked more violent than what happened on the 6th...

Omit one leading or trailing sentence that adds important relevant context  and the meaning of his words is forever changed.   I want some more spice  like this.   Not quite Marco.  A lot of us watched the coverage and saw people walking around carrying flags  while the media talking heads wailed and gnashed their teeth over the  quot violence quot .   I saw some pushing and shoving at the police lines later in the day  but nothing I would call violence.

There  39 s been way worse shit than that at the capitol in the past.  It was a remarkably calm and peaceful capitol hill  quot riot quot  by historical standards.  I  39 m far more concerned with the reactions from just about everyone  including Rubio who is a total sack of shit.  which is why his poll numbers rose afterwards. imagine what those numbers will be when we see the DNI report and fully grasp what congress just did.

So what poll is this one from the daily caller   The one with  quot approved quot  news.  Quinnapiac.  Is this like NBC  39 s  quot undecided quot  voters who had already said they were voting for Biden or even worked for his campaign   The daily caller thinks they balanced but they re just another propaganda outlet.  Lol  last week there was another poll saying his approval went up. Jesus....  Hmmmm...why don t I believe polls anymore  oh that s right.  Polls are commisioned and used for politicians to raise money for campaigns.  He  39 s got my support  So polls are suddenly legitimate again after the last election disaster   This is literal fake news.  Hes polling at record highs.  a href  https   www.rasmussenreports.com public content politics trump administration prez track jan011  https   www.rasmussenreports.com public content politics trump administration prez track jan011  a   But keep pushing your bullshit.  I  39 m not sure eif anything is true anymore  Ah  yes  another one of those polls where they ask questions to a 100 not so random people and somehow that reflects what 300 MILLION think  Lol. I ve seen three different articles today. One says numbers are up. One says numbers are down. And one says numbers are the same. Yet people tell me fake news is all a myth.  Well considering the last few said his numbers were up  I  39 ll just continue disregarding polls since they haven  39 t given me a correct answer or even come close to a correct answer in a long time.  they just can  39 t get any lower  folks  this is the end of Orange Man   Who cares   Polls are nonsense.  No one should trust poling anymore  If you re gonna make me believe either the daily caller or Rasmussen  I think I know which one I m gonna pick. Myself and all the Trump supporters I know still completely support the president.  The left has never been about individual freedom. They have been trying gun confiscation for nearly a century. Hitler  Mussolini  Pinochet  marxists  communists  Maoists  Soviets  they are all leftists. The left has been about power.  My view of the left is definitely starting to evolve as time goes by to see that. I use to see the left as free speech advocates  but it s clear now they only care about that when it benefits them.   It helps them  it supports their world views   Fake News  Polled at Nancy Pelosi  39 s brunch cocktail party.  Ah yes  Quinnipiac. The gold standard of polling.  Lies  damned lies  and statistics. Polls have been outed for many years now as methods of forcing a narrative.  Cmon dude

I know it  39 s satire  but humor can be right you know.  Article mentions buying all the paper companies so they can  39 t print  which I wouldn  39 t put it past them.  Exactly what I was thinking. Back to pamphlet printing  The number of printing facilities set on fire would hit levels never before seen  and of course the mainstream media would completely ignore it.   quot Green New Deal bars tree harvesting for paper quot   I mean  I d subscribe  and to the downvoting basement dwellers  I realize it s satire   So would I.  It would be a welcome site to see something in my mailbox that wasn  39 t junkmail.  100  I  39 d buy the paper. I tried a few years ago to find physical papers delivered to my door   mailbox. Only the far left local garbage paper still offered delivery. It  39 s really a shame.  The above the fold stories on the mocked up newspaper are sheer brilliance.  Glad people are starting to wake up to the dangers of monopolistic tech giants. At the very least we need anti trust cases against Amazon  Facebook and Alphabet with more teeth than anything we ve seen in the past.  The problem isn  39 t really that they  39 re a monopoly  it  39 s that they  39 re all working directly with one political party to push a political agenda  while suppressing opposition voices . If there are a dozen big social media sites then they can  39 t all be monopolies  but they can come together to use their power for mass propaganda and mass censorship.  Lmao  Wait until the post office says it won  39 t be mailing it  I d pay to get one one in the mail every week.  So glad that the Bee can give us a laugh through these dark and troubling times.  Actually  print should be brought back. Liberals don  39 t like documents. That  39 s why digital is their game...they can erase everything in seconds.  Even though it s satire  I don t think it would be a bad idea to subscribe. We can all use some laughter early in the morning when walking outside.  This is how the postal service will be saved.

The capitol rioters are being treated differently than BLM  they re actually being charged for rioting.  Not to mention that they used tear gas  flash bangs  mace  etc. just on the crowd outside.  Lol yeah what did you think would happen  Any time anyone who politically leans to the right of Mao Zedong does anything  it s automatically painted as a white supremecist uprising.   BLM is literally writing the news in 2021  Communists spreading communist propaganda.   It quotes a number of Black Lives Matter activists who misrepresent the day s events to suggest that the police went easy on the pro Trump rioters because they were predominantly white. ...yeah I m sure it s just because they were predominantly white  probably had nothing to do with the fact that they weren t destroying people s businesses and millions of dollars of property  s  It s the Washington Post.

t3_kv3gj1,Eliminating Trump from being elected again one motivator in impeachment push Pelosi says,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv3gj1/eliminating_trump_from_being_elected_again_one/,I suspect the primary goal is to get Republicans to vote against impeachment. Those doing so will be accused of   quot inciting violence quot  and supporting insurrection.  This is 100  just political theatre. Trump isn  39 t getting impeached less than a week away from the end of his Presidency.  They can still impeach him once he  39 s out of office  then he won  39 t be able to run again ever and they  39 ll have a Democrat majority in the Senate.  It s over a week but yeah  So admitting it  39 s a stunt to stop him from running again should shut down the whole thing  amp  should get her removed instead for such a stunt but she  39 s a Democrat so that  39 s not how this works.  Removed  Leftists will give her an award for silencing the opposition.  She s making a wish  It s not her birthday yet...  This is not going to be an impeachment  this is going to be a trial for treason. They are going to use the storming of the Capitol as an attempt to assassinate the 2nd  3rd and 4th in line to the president. And its to signal Trump JR not to run for President.  Too bad they won t have time to gain traction. Just like a basketball game  the clock is running down fast  Do you remember Obama 1st inauguration  There was a crowd of people chanting  quot Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye quot  to Bush...   Trump Jr is  100 running for president in the future. He has learned a lot from his Father  39 s time in office. He has none of the scandal following him that his father had entering the office. I think he will be all of the good aspects of Trump and none of the bad. Plus  Trump  39 s devoted fan base transition to him versus someone like Ted Cruz. Impeachment or not  with the events over the past four years the Democrats have created a lifelong liberal eating monster out of Trump Jr.  Agree... this is why they are going to impeach Trump and push Treason. They dont want Trump Jr in 2024.  Removal wouldn t preclude Jr from running. Nor would it necessarily impede his popularity.  Agree... but they going to make those that support Trump or those attending at January 6th rally to be criminals.  Honestly  I follow him on social media  and I was very very hesitant about the idea of a Trump dynasty  but  you have a point. He seems like he is more calculated and less of them out loudmouth  in the sense that when he does go off  he is very cautious about the way he does it and the words he uses  whereas I think his father just shoots from the hip without even thinking.  Yes  Nasty  keep acting like 2024 is going to be another legitimate election.  Jerry Nadler pushed for Bill Clinton to pardon Susan Rosenberg who actually bombed the capital building.  Obviously the Dems are OK with violence and terrorism.  This woman should be  and should  39 ve been  impeached.  No she shouldn t. Neither should trump either time. We have to stop this nonsense. It s a waste of time and it makes us look third world and unstable.  No hes right. She broke chain of command to try to get them to strip him of the nuclear launch codes and also gave Pence 24hrs to impeach him. That is clear treason...  She said 24 hours or she will impeach. That s a bitchy ultimatum not treason.   You still can  39 t tell someone who outranks you  Pence  to enable the 25th Amendment. She has no power to do that hence treason...i dont know the actually laws on it but just from being in the Marines you would get so fucked for doing anything even close to this...  Yeah  so she wasn t able to do that. The system worked. You don t have to impeach someone every time they step out of line. You can just slap them down. We have to get our of this mindset. Look at this  she s trying to impeach a dude who is leaving office in a number of HOURS.  Oh I agree but at what point do we use their own game plan against them. She has done enough to be impeached yet nobody would dare to do that to all knowing powerful Nancy...im over these rules for thee but not for me. We need a fucking revolution  We may need a revolution  that s not an unreasonable position.  This isn  39 t why she is doing this.  Agreed.  She doesny want him releasing classified info on her pedo ring or Chinese influence.  Why wouldn t he have already   Wasting more money during a pandemic. Its the democratic way.  Why did Twitter suddenly delete trumps Twitter with 80 million followers  Why is Pelosi suddenly urging in a psychotic way to impeach Trump with 10 days left on his term  Her laptop was stolen during the raid of the Capitol. What does Trump have  It s hard not to go down rabbit holes when every platform is trying to rid of Trump from communicating.   quot You know that process that happens every 4 years where the people select a nominee in a primary and in then vote for their selection in November for President of the United States   Well  screw you  I decide who is and who is not running for president  quot   super democratic  People really support these bully tactics. The behavior of our government officials have been embarassing.  Silencing him before he releases whatever information the left is terrified he will spill is another motivator  I bet.  Yep.  She s scared he d win  Why are the democraps bothering with this now that they know they can steal any election they want.  More BS from Nancy. Who knew that such a tiny woman could hold so much hate   She keeps it in her  24k fridge and refuels nightly.
t3_kunbni,Parler CEO Says Service Dropped By Every Vendor Could End Business,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kunbni/parler_ceo_says_service_dropped_by_every_vendor/,He should take the servers to Israel  They should take it to Sealand  Or Poland.  Israel is not pro conservative. Please do not be fooled  Am Israeli  the elites here are very pro Democrat but the people overwhelmingly pro Trump. Even according to left leaning polls.   Oh boy looks like we re heading for another time period with corporations running the country with no subtlety. Big Tech is every bit as bad as oil companies were back in the day.  Can you elaborate   Before the whole anti trust hammer came down for a while politics in the US were under sway of powerful corporations from the oil and railroad industries. There were probably more but to my knowledge they were the biggest. Anyway due to their bribery and  donations  to politicians in Congress these corporations controlled American politics.  Gotcha. Thanks for explaining.  Sounds like the issue is with government power instead of corporate power  The root of the problem is definitely government corruption but the powerful corporations still need to be dealt with.   Don  39 t be weak. Get your own servers asap.  It  39 s not anywhere near that simple.  Banking is next.  Watching these big tech companies which control the vast majority of internet space work in concert to deny financial and infrastructure that is available to everyone else  isn  39 t something to sit back and pass off as working as intended.  It  39 s a classic.  a href  https   en.wikipedia.org wiki Corporatism  A popular slogan of the Italian Fascists under Mussolini was  quot Tutto nello Stato  niente al di fuori dello Stato  nulla contro lo Stato quot    quot everything for the state  nothing outside the state  nothing against the state quot  .  a   You  39 re 100  correct  but we have to start somewhere and now or we  39 ll be swamped.  If again  they do that T3 carriers  ISP for corporations  can just deny them access. And ICANN  the worlds DNS registrar  or simply the group that manages the translation from  a href  https   reddit.com  reddit.com  a  to an IP address  and IP address manager  can also deny them that too.   If ICANN starts playing politics  hell froze over  Unironically  if ICANN started playing politics  I think we would be at the point of a real NWO situation as crazy as it seems. At that point ICANN could reject all request unless they  quot known quot  that their narrative would be met  shutdown sites at a whim  or say for example  tell reddit to remove this very sub or loose its IP and DNS name .  Luckily the internet is open and flexible enough where that level of censorship could have it  39 s face shoved in the mud. Anyone can write a new network protocol and make it accessable to the general public just like any other web browser.  Yay technofascism   What if no company will sell them the servers   Any computer can be a server. It  39 s that they want to rent server space from a provider. They could  if they have the technical staff  set up their own servers and host from their own network.  Yes  but they would need a ton  it would take a long time to get them  and companies may not sell them the servers. They  39 re not going to go to best buy to pick them up.  Again  you don  39 t have to  quot buy servers quot  from a specific company. You could go to Newegg or Micro Center or Amazon or eBay and start buying parts. Heck  you can probably get decommissioned servers on eBay at a pretty reasonable price.  not that simple or fast  Remember when EVERYONE told Trump he couldn  39 t get a Covid vaccine in under 5 years...  Yes and China Joe biden is gonna claim all credit     watch.  Would be hilarious if the left kept pushing censorship until farmers and truck drivers said  quot fuck it  we  39 re not delivering to the cities any more quot   expect seizings then in   39 the emergency  39   We are on that path  or at least balkanization.  I mean they can seize them  but can they force them to work  I know the 13th amendment dose allow for involuntary as an punishment  but not because  quot they wont work. quot  Your not breaking the law by not working  unless some crazy laws say otherwise.  they can coerce  and DONT expect in the end for these enemies to respect ANY of the Constitution    I started a new stock watch list  I have insta  face book  apple and  Amazon it s the weekend but I did play some puts because I think they will all drop  Amazon can take the hit they are extremely diverse. I would not gamble against them  at least not betting for much more than a couple point drop.   If I m a company looking at AWS for my entire backend  this type of move makes me very queasy. The thought that internal external politics renders my infrastructure vendor a single point of failure will give many technology execs flop sweats.   to be fair  they all just demonstrated the ability to co ordinate with each other to put their competition out of business. that  39 s a pretty chilling and powerful message  much like the democrat majorities endorsing this assault on free speech.  Puts on apple is a pretty good way to lose money. I d do it on Twitter though  To be fair  Apple up to this point hasn t told half the country they don t want their business. Has apple actually innovated in any meaningful way since losing Steve Jobs    I feel the same way  but it s pretty undeniable right now that iOS is more secure than Android. I don t care for google either. I m hoping Microsoft steps up to the plate and releases a competitive phone with secure software.  twitter is the only one i see suffering permanent damage from this.  Apple announced a new deal over the weekend in the run up to earnings. People are going to try to push this stock up before earnings. This news alone could also push apple up as well.  Is there anything that WE can do to assist Parler   What s being done to this company is scummy.  Google  Apple  Amazon  every other web hosting service  every other text message service  every other email service  all their lawyers  all ditched them  That s some deep collusion all being done to kill a Twitter competitor...  You can sideload the app on Android. Problem is if they can  39 t get the server space.  Don  39 t forget   what was that bugbunny saying  quot This means  W.... quot   is there any way to save it  this is the beginning of the end of our country   removed   The progressives are going to be quite surprised when the authoritarians set their sights on them.  I didn t realize Burn Loot Murder and Antifa were big on Parler   removed   Mods gotta stop just giving out flair to idiots like this.  His flair was something like  durp  I think they gave it to him as an insult.  If they have the legal protections of a platform they have the legal responsibility of a platform. A platform is free speech
t3_kut347,Storming of the Capitol was stupid but Democrats flaming hypocrisy is outrageous,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kut347/storming_of_the_capitol_was_stupid_but_democrats/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  https   discord.gg conservative  a   Small businesses and low income housing projects were set on fire over the summer and democrats didn t care  but now that THEY were the target of a riot suddenly it s the end of the world  According to Democrats  it was  worse than 9 11    They re kings and queens and some peasants defiled their DC Temple.  That is exactly why they are so bitter about it. They want to believe they are untouchable.   quot The world will know that free men stood against a tyrant  that few stood against many  and before this battle was over  even a god king can bleed. quot   I can t remember who  but some Congress critter gave an interview and referred to the Capitol building as  sacred ground  as if it were a holy site where people should worship them.  In a secular world it basically is their sacred ground.  Oh gods on Capital Hill  please have mercy on me with  600 after locking me inside for months.   I guess it makes sense when you look at it through the lens of worshiping government like it s a divine being sent to save humanity  that makes sense. Lol I always just kinda viewed our reps as employees of the American people.  I m becoming convinced that left wing and right wing people just see their relationship with government in diametrically opposed ways.  These same people were calling Mount Rushmore a  quot monument to white supremacy quot  a few months ago.   Which is funny because it wasn t even as bad as June 2020 when Democrats caused over  15M in damages  fires  etc from the riots.  I think the total will was 2bn . A few days ago was very stupid. All summer fall long was targeting hard working Americans with politicians backing the destruction.   Or the white house riot where 50 secret service agents were injured  monuments were burned  and Trump was forced into the bunker there. Not a single Democrat or media personality condemned that riot. Which was worse by far than the Capitol breach.  Yuuuup   It is sickening the hypocrisy.  It s why I really like the article.  I love how they were also saying how we need to defund the police all last year. Then  come Wednesday  they couldn  39 t stop saying   quot We need more police action  quot   Nope. Because the lie was too widespread that too many people believed it.  even then  THE cops told the stupid mother fucker to get down  the fucker was going into his car... what were they suppose to do  Be like a movie and stand there until whatever happened afterwards happened   Less than ONE DAY of protests that showed up on their doorstep. That s how long it took them to bust out the live rounds. That s how much they care about themselves vs how much they care about us.  I especially love the hypocrisy about cops. First they say all cops are bad  then a cop gets killed and they are mourning a hero  Lmao they have zero values  I also saw some of my leftist friends who were crying during the George Floyd riots things like  you re a terrible human being if you comment about property being hurt but not a live being lost    were celebrating and making fun of the death of that woman at the Capitol.  That  39 s where put screenshots side by side and post it as a comment. And if they delete it  post it on your own page.  They are the results of losing all of your moral compass.  Yea these things aren t mutually exclusive lol  I just wish the word  coup  would stop being used. These drunk dudebros had no plan after getting in. A coup suggest they planned on replacing elected officials.  They could call it a Capital Hill Occupation Protest  Those are totally legit  Suddenly it seems that it is no longer trendy to  Occupy important places  huh   It  39 s called a  quot sit in quot  when Democrats do it.   a href  https   thehill.com homenews senate 409999 scores of kavanaugh protesters arrested after descending on senate building  It was only two years ago...  a   Correct.  A coup doesn t involve police opening doors and helping people up the stairs.    I ve been seeing this comment about the cops letting them in a lot but haven t seen it myself. Do you have a link   This is the best video I  39 ve seen  a href  https   twitter.com christina bobb status 1347596278583197698 s 19  https   twitter.com christina bobb status 1347596278583197698 s 19  a   ....by being elected president  Is there something I  39 m not seeing   Kek...  elected  if you ignore video proof of ballot harvesting  statistical anomalies that have never happened in election history  that biden is most voted for President in history though he scored low on Democratic confidence  oh and thousands of pages of affidavits from hundreds of poll watchers.  All while not a single audit was done to prove the legitimacy of the election.  Ironically  Democrats had 0.001  of the data and spent 10 months trying to impeach trump off of ONE whistleblower who had direct ties to Democratic Party  was never asked to do anything and had no repercussions when it was found out it was a farce.  Ahh  I see. The pendulum will swing back  it always does.  A sitting president of the United States using a couple of unarmed supporters that everyone knew would be protesting in this location to stage the coup.   Pelosi literally came closer to attempting a real coup than they did.  Sounds like projection on Nancy s part.    a href  https   youtu.be j2TUNlvJpo0  https   youtu.be j2TUNlvJpo0  a   Projection is all democrats know  Storming the Capital building was a pretty stupid move. Doesn t really compare to the last 6 months of BLM Biden supporter violence rioting looting though does it  I m from the UK and even I can see the blaring double standards   This is a textbook example of exploiting a tragedy for your own purposes...and the media is gleefully playing along.  Liberals are a lost cause.  Don  39 t say that. Maybe the elected Democrats are  since they  39 re so power hungry  but with the right attitude and the right presentation  we can sway the Democrat voters.  And stunningly  without hesitation  the lemmings follow along.  It  39 s interesting that Biden said  quot had it been BLM that stormed the capital things would have been handled much differently quot  like it wouldn  39 t have absolutely been downplayed and justified. They would have called it a  quot mostly peaceful storming of the capital quot  and still found a way to blame the right for it.  I just don t understand how people are arguing the police went easy on them because they re white  despite the fact that 4 people were killed in a single day. Can you name a single one of the BLM riots with that level of force used  People just believe anything because of a couple pictures the media pushes where there wasn t tear gas.  And a black man shot an unarmed white woman.  em crickets  em . Reverse that role and see what happens.  Police went easy on them in most cases because the protesters were being polite and non violent.  BLM should try it some time.  The hypocrisy is mind numbing but their overdramatized opinions on it are just insanity  Glad this was put in the Washington Times.  The hypocrisy is maddening to myself and so many of you   The media forgets how politicians like AOC  Pelosi  Harris were APPLAUDING crazy left wing activists when they stormed the Senate building to protest.  Why were the left politicians not criminalized like the Right now is   How is this different   Based on video  police opened the doors for the protestors.  The woman who sadly lost her life was murdered by a trigger happy cop.  The left has done so much worse and we have to stand against these people because they are allowing themselves different standards.  NONE of it is right.  Americans should disagree at the ballot box.  But when conservatives are being targeted by Judenrats who are trying to turn Trump supporters in for crime of being conservative   This cannot be allowed   Being political opposites is NOT a crime.  Wow that comment took a disappointing turn at the end    Never saw it before. Seems to be referring to an organization used to opresss the Jews in the ghettos. Quite the hyperbole  but not really offensive.   removed   Pretty much the OP is putting conservatives in the place of the Jews in terms of persecution. I guess you could say this down plays their hardship with the hyperbole. At the same time Biden and Democrats run around using terms like slavery and racism as if it was going out of style. And that 100  down plays those actually horrific events. But in this case the poster seems intentionally being hyperbolic as a form of emotion.  Thanks for the correction.

I still believe there s truth to this but not quite in the way Maria Zack told it  Has anybody actually seen read this supposed affidavit   Yeah     Care to elaborate  So far I have only seen accusations based off of an affidavit that nobody has actually seen.

I mean...why  The NRA is a dog whistle for liberals  go after the NRA  FOC and GOA are getting the work done.  Biden doesn  39 t like his rape victims to be armed.  Hey  remember when Biden was credibly accused of sexual assault and the media covered it up  Good times.  Well  you can t carry a gun if you are under 18  so Biden is probably safe anyway.  That  39 s gonna be a yikes from me dog.  I remember when his VP said she believed his accuser  too.  I agree with you but like it or not the NRA is the face of gun owners.  They ve sold us out time and time again but they still have the money  resources  and connections that the FOC and GOA could only dream of.  However the NRA goes  goes the rest of these fun lobbyist groups and then gun owners rights.  I read it as NBA and I was kinda okay with it.  Cool  now do the NAACP.  It  39 s gonna be a weird four years.  Just fire a double barrel shotgun into the air  Joe.  Get a shotgun   Two blasts    epic...   quot Defeat  quot  Like in battle  He  39 s inciting violence  Impeach    Well  I got news for ya gun manufacturers  I m coming for you and I m gonna take you down.   Yeah this reminds me of the argument libs say about AR  39 s not being around at the time the 2A was written in the bill of rights. Yeah well  my counter argument to that is we didn  39 t have tanks  aircraft carriers or thermonuclear weapons then either. So I  39 m pretty sure an AR is pretty non threatening compared to those things....  When the 2A was written  the populace was well armed and the state was not.  It was meant to stay that way.  Do I should go out and buy a tank and a rocket launcher      Hey I ll drive   Yes.  Corn pop is in hiding  Just send them to  quot re education camps quot   Joe. It worked well for Stalin.  Defeat the NRA  In what  a pushup contest   Uncle Joe and Cornpop are teaming up finally. They re challenging all comers to a diving contest.

Remember when they released videos of people collapsing in the streets  foaming at the mouth because they died of Covid  Then videos of people in full body suits with masks on spraying down the streets with some sort of liquid  I do. China is assho liars   I do remember that and now I m wondering what they were trying to achieve with those videos. I had thought those were leaked videos but if China purposefully released them  what was their propaganda angle   Probably to get the US scared and shut down so the economy is crippled  to make it look like it was Trump  39 s fault. Insurance to make him look bad so no one votes for him  in case their stealing of votes wasn  39 t enough.  Fear was their intention. They wanted everyone to stay indoors while they contained the outbreak. Tbf they did seem to get it under control quickly though obviously their numbers are bs. Even so their heavy handed approach was maybe the best plan.  Too late now. Maybe the media and rest of the world should  39 ve been more honest for the past  idk  9 months  and actually given a shit about investigating China.  Come on  man  They got their covid death rate down to 5 deaths per day within like a week and had it under control better than President Trump  How dare you question us for believing anything the Chinese propagandists say   The media  probably  China says  OwO senpai Fauci   enter me daddy   Fucking crazy how that happens RIGHT after Beijing Biden is set to take office

If there is nothing to the cases  then get that on the record. Suspicious how they don  39 t want to let any of these cases have a even five seconds in a courtroom.  You are too kind when you say   suspicious .

It doesn t even matter who says it anymore. As long as you say it first or say it louder  you are the more credible one in the room. And Trump s been on the defense for most of his presidential career.  The enemy have us surrounded   they won t get away this time    Chesty Puller  Says the woman who is visibly drunk by 10am most days.  This makes me wonder what Pelosi is afraid of.  It seems weird that she won  39 t just wait until he is gone.  It makes me think that Trump has one last card to play... and I don  39 t mean activating the military with the insurrection act.  I mean... if he did that  it wouldn  39 t be that surprising at this point  but it  39 s risky and doesn  39 t seem likely.

The Capitol unrest was our Reichstag fire.   more of a Reichstag  quot someone left the stove on and burnt the pizza but let  39 s just say the whole building went up in flames quot   The morons who stormed the capitol are not conservatives  stop associating with and defending them.

Yea this really looks like that mate   a href  https   youtu.be cwTlxKjiW5g  https   youtu.be cwTlxKjiW5g  a    Are you implying they didn  39 t  Ohhhhh lookie here  I can share video too  Let me guess  dEePfAkE vIdEo      You actually are. You are stating one fact  the one you want to use to bolster your argument  and are using that to disregard another fact or set of facts that counter your argument.   I literally showed you video from the capitol. Two videos. How am I lying  I  39 ve nothing to do with Q  but you sure sound like a leftist  deny facts and all.  indeed ... though more like the Reichstag cracked window and people wandering around aimlessly moment.  This is going to be difficult but it will get done. Even if Parler builds its own data centers the ISPs will throttle traffic to from it. 2021 is going to be a long year for true conservatives. The task of building every digital asset from scratch for conservatives is truly daunting. Better to focus on the task at hand and not look too far ahead.  Too bad we dont have net neutrality anymore. But at that point they would just deny connection entirely.  Makes you think  liberals hunting down Trump supporters is like the nazis hunting down Jews.  Except the Trump supporters have guns  Sounds like he needs an elite crack team for the job. He should call Rudy Guiliani  Next  they  39 ll try to fire every non leftist from their jobs.  These lefist motherfuckers are playing hardball.  Thank God I work for a conservative company in a conservative  salt of the earth industry.  If the leftists want to cut us out good fucking luck to them because we  39 re the plumbers that ensure you have water  sewer and sump pump systems.  I  39 m a manufacturers rep and my customers are the plumbers in my region.  All of them.  Can  39 t think of a single one who  39 s far left.  I  39 d give you an award  but you LITERALLY just paid yourself.  Well done sir  if your ever in clarksville  ill buy you a beer.  Wait  are you just monkeying around  Or just trying to be friendly    quot Look  the people you are after are the people you depend on. We cook your meals  we haul your trash  we connect your calls  we drive your ambulances  we guard you while you sleep quot   I  39 d think they may also run into issues when farmers decide to not grow food for them. They want to play hardball. Let  39 s play hardball.  I know what to say when they complain.  quot Dont like it  Start your own agriculture industry. quot   I  39 d love to see the look on a marxists face when the farmers play that game  We all saw their  quot garden quot  in chaz with the mentally unstable  quot farmer quot  rolling around in the mud.  I was absolutely convinced those pictures were photoshopped or shitposting... Nope  they are THAT stupid.  Guess I should expect to have my head on the chopping block soon for having a flag displayed behind me during business calls.  I expect every business in America will fall bc lefties don  39 t have jobs.  Imagine thinking half the country is unemployed  if i lose my shitposting job this country is officially over  Is this really surprising anyone  The left has been sending us crystal clear messages for the last 6 or so year that the second they had control they would try to wipe us out. Coexistence hasn  39 t been an option for a while. They dont want unity they want submission. So either submit or fight  Exactly. I don  39 t understand how anyone could not have seen what was coming. This is a communist takeover that  39 s been in the works for over 60 years  theyve just quit hiding it in the last decade. These are the same syphilis ridden radicals from the 60  39 s that have taken over all of the modern cultural institutions.   4 years of revenge governance incoming.  THIS is what fascism looks like  Fascism comes from the state. This is definitely collusion  violation of natural rights  and blatant bigotry.  Fascism was and IS an agreement between the state and private industry. This IS fascism. They  39 re getting all their queues from the political leaders of the new regime and they  39 re sycophantically dutiful.  Fascism was massive regulations to exert control over corporations. Businesses had no real choice  though I  39 m sure some were eager. In Italy a number of corporations were put under the control of their version of unions.  Fascism is when the state and corporations collude  Fascism uses extreme regulations to control corporations. For instance when Obama appointed a Car Czar to take over GM and give the auto workers union a controlling share of the company is an example of Fascism.  When conservative companies start challenging the monopolies the left will finally move to have government step in and shut them down.  That is the essential model of corporatist Fascism. Coordination of business efforts with the government who serves as an agent against competition. One hand washes the other.  I agree but they re hiding behind  private company  They can do what they want . If we start to challenge that with free enterprise the government will overtly step in   deleted   That is a fight fire with fire type attitude. The left are bigots  I don  39 t condone more bigotry as the answer. But it does seem like the elites are fully mobilized to attack conservatives.  Defense comes in many forms. The enemy has attacked.  CCP going all out  Weird that this comment was hidden..  it  39 s  quot controversial quot   Would be a shame if Xinnie the pooh got his feelers hurt. Whatever you do dont bring up the concentration camps  Oh  and DEFINITELY dont bring up the forced sterilization and organ harvesting   that  39 s what the left has planned for us down the road. it  39 s all the same ideology.  Im am avid china watcher. Really like chinese dissident channels. Been interested for a few years. Its surreal seeing our media use the same tactics ive seen the ccp use.  the difference here if course is that we  39 re going to win.  Im going to love watching the market self correct  The economic migration is epic already.  imagine unleashing the US  39  full potential after 6 decades of slumber.  He definitely exposed just how corrupt washington is. Shocking how depraved these people are.  They need to move their severs to Poland.  This going to be a rough few months for free speech online but if free speech platforms can get through this they will be better and tougher for the long haul.  True  but who knows what the libs could accomplish now. Although  I  39 d THINK there  39 d be no way  now that you mention it  because of the SC... Who knows  though... they are good at finding loopholes.  I would like to direct your attention to GoDaddy delisting  a href  https   ar15.com  ar15.com  a    my above comment that they can delist stuff from DNS servers was apparently prophetic...  Idk who needs to read this but  Gab.com is fucking legit   Its a pandemic. The dems have shut down as much as they can. The businesses are scared to be the next ones cancelled so they cant take the risk when they are struggling to stay afloat.  All I can say is he should learn to pick his fights.  He didn  39 t pick any fights...with anyone.  victim blaming  Well he  em was  em  asking for it dressing that way and allowing dissent in public.  s  Nah more like trying to show off but instead it bit him in the ass  being an American is wasted on you  I  39 d say I use it to my advantage and due to that I  39 d say I  39 m pretty content.  And pretty clueless. Ignorance is bliss.  Not really  its more of not caring about stupid people when they face consequences.   Why yes I do  I  39 m one of the essential workers you hear about but the difference that my job may be one of the most essential ones.  I really dont know how you got me not having skills from that.   What did the CEO do that qualifies as  quot showing off quot    That many were competing for his business  Why would that make him deserving of collusion based market practices of the literally gate keepers of all apps for the US  I  39 m not following your logic.  Could be but also displays cockiness. Yes it would be admirable that he stands for unbridled free speech but in reality  just like we  39 ve seen with Gab  4chan and other examples  anything that is completely unregulated just gets flooded with illegal and horrendous actions and messages. This edginess comes forth from the thought of being anonymous and could lead to drastic actions.

It  39 s dead  Exactly   there have been apps taken down before but this is different. If they fit into the same space as Twitter  then according to how Twitter has been treated  it should extend to Parler  platform v. Publisher debate . I m sure there is a better way to word it but I haven t had my coffee yet.  You need a host willing to take the backlash of hosting it  nobody in the western world will.

Apple  google  and amazon have said Parler have not done enough to limit calls to violence  but what criteria are they using to judge that  Are they using other platforms like twitter and Facebook as examples  Twitter lets that shit fly all the time if a lefty say it. Facebook does a decent job about moderating that stuff  but I  39 ve reported a few post that call for violence that are still up.

Did anyone expect anything different   But.....but he said  quot unity quot .......  He only said it out of one side of his mouth  Mitt is going to be so disappointed.  And Kasich.  Sounds left  Oh no  that  39 s totally bipartisan. Didn  39 t you know that moderate democrats are now considered to be the  quot new right quot  according to their party  so he had an even  quot bipartisan quot  consisting of half of these moderate democrats  GOP in their eyes  and half socialist extreme left wing people  democrats in their eyes .  I mean  his cabinet is controlled by far left tech CEOs.  No Republicans there.  Biden s a liar and water s wet.  Commitment   Now that s funny  that man can t stop lying  People who voted for him obviously do not know their dick from their thumb. Because honestly this is not surprisingly in the slightest.  Lying  racist AF POS.  Biden is going to do what Trump  em should  em  have done and purge every last holdover from the previous administration.  Even Obama has at least a RINO in his cabinet.  I voted for Biden. Here  39 s why.  So  You want Kamala Harris to be president  Because you re going to get radical crazy Kamala Harris as president.  I  39 m really hoping the guy with the crazy hair from The History channel who would say  quot Aliens quot  is correct.  OK  I was concerned there for a minute    Honestly  I will contribute to that guy s campaign funds  Yeah I joke troll in my own way.

I had the same thought. When having a conversation about the election one of the counterpoints was how much people hate trump. It dawned on me that the dark side  driven by hate  was the left today.  Wow.  This sounds like something that Hitler would approve of.  Sure. As soon as the Democrats expel every member who claimed Russia rigged 2016 or that Stacy Abrams is the real governor of GA.  Not to mention every one of them that explicitly called for street violence or defended it.  Keep going after them.... Youre going to make them the leaders for the 2024 nomination  I was under the assumption that objecting the electoral college was allowed by law. I mean  apparently it happened in 2005 and no one freaked out   Don t cloud the issue with facts.  Dangerous precident for the republic.  Democrats don  39 t want a republic.

We need to be VERY careful about the news we circulate. Anything wrong  and leftists immediately wave the  false information  flag...which makes us look bad.   This is what they want  us to fear and question truths while they spread lies about us unfettered  Strong agree. Subs like  a href   r publicfreakouts  r publicfreakouts  a  live off the politically motivated editing of videos designed to cause outrage  usually with all previous context removed.  Is there actually any video showing what they actually said or did   I did a bunch of digging after coming across this  and unfortunately I have not yet found a video of their behavior prior to being forced to disembark. I ve seen two videos of them getting escorted off  but neither had any of the build up  so it ll be their word against Delta s.  No.  I haven t seen any but there were several videos on Twitter last night from bystanders who were all in shock about what was going down and their accounts seemed to verify the narrative.  If this is true my  quot do not support these companies quot  list is going to need another page.  Short of her saying  bomb    fire    gun  or  terrorist  or if she was berating someone or threatened physical violence  there really isn t any justification for removing someone from the plane.  People who support this think they re the resistance.  You  39 re not the  quot resistance quot  when all the big multinational corporations are with you  all the large educational institutions are with you  and the government is on your side as well.  But it  39 s easier that way. It  39 s too hard to go up against them. May as well go with them and think I  39 m a hero.  These people would be cheering for the Empire destroying Alderaan with the Death Star if they thought they liked Trump.  Is there a statement from Delta  Is there more to the story   My guess would be that there might be.  I read a post from someone in  a href   r publicfreakout   r publicfreakout  a  claiming to be on the plane the video starts as they re being escorted off the plane  so it doesn t verify anything  but he states he was sitting a couple rows in front of them with noise canceling earphones in  and their conversation was so loud he could hear them over his audio.  bUt dElTa iS A pRiVaTe cOmPaNy   It is funny that after 10 months of supporting shutdowns of entire industries  and arresting business owners who opened their shops  Dems will now pretend that they believe in private companies   Ron Paul always said true libertarianism requires strong courts that uphold the constitution and free speech  sad thing is even with our majority they  39 re just bumps on a log.  BuiLD yOUr oWn AirLInE  Right  a private company that only exists because it  39 s propped up by millions of taxpayer subsidies and frequent bailouts.  Somebody explained to me that when liberals say   quot That is a private company. If you don  39 t like what they are doing  then feel free not to use them  quot  what they mean is that the company is private because it  39 s not owned by the government.   im sure  a href   r libertarian  r libertarian  a  is ok with this  I think you mean  a href   r politicslite  r politicslite  a   First post I see... Eww.  Yeah what  39 s up with that place   I popped in there last week thinking I  39 d find some agreeable ideas but it looks more like Biden  39 s fan club.  As a libertarian  I joined that sub and then unsubscribed after about two weeks. I was new to Reddit  so first  I thought   holy shit  these people are crazy. I m not really a libertarian   Then I quickly realized just how distorted and left leaning peoples  points of view are on Reddit.  I know right how many billions has the government spent on the airline industry   This is their new favorite saying  Isn t the airline industry in the United States the beneficiary of heavy government subsidies  both airlines and airports   Sure are  Every 4 years it seems  I guess the left supports the baker who didn  39 t want to make a cake for a gay wedding now  right   REEEEE   No fucking way. Lol. There has to be more to this story. There is not a snowball  39 s chance in Hell.  Really  You still believe that  They silenced the sitting President of the United States and you re still here with the  not in this country  bullshit   I  39 m still trying to process all of this. It  39 s hard to take in. It  39 s Orwellian. The Democrat party is starting to resemble Ingsoc. I wanna believe there is more to this story.  I mean  just speculating  but this is the flight home after the demonstrations the guy with the dark circles under his eyes is on film exiting Congress after disrupting the vote certification debate I m betting they were pretty amped up on what they had done and probably carried some of that boisterous rally energy with them onto the plane. Again  just speculating  having flown on airplanes and having been careful never to get kicked off one...  They should sue Delta. They can t legally do that.  I was thinking the same thing  there might also be a hefty civil suit vs the TSA depending on what all they did as well.  They can refuse business to any customer for any reason  political affiliation is not a protected class  right   Courts have ruled in some instances that airline access is protected under your right to travel. So there are legal challenges that can be mounted but I suspect it will be an uphill battle. But hey u might get a nice settlement  Technically speaking  the two people already paid and the company was fine with it. Kicking them off for talking about Trump could be discrimination based on political beliefs. Unless the company issues a full refund  I can t see them getting away from this without legal issues.  I have no doubt they got a full refund  that  39 s the only way to absolve yourself of legal exposure.  In some states  like California   it is.  Except it  39 s okay to have sex with people without disclosing you have HIV.  I  39 ll bet only one side  though.  FAA regulations state there has to be a reason why.  I can  39 t remember the exact terminology.  But there needs to be a reason why  and if it was for something nonviolent they usually have to compensate them  like they would if you get bumped .  No they can t  They actually can. There is no legal provision for discrimination for politics.  Unless they issued a full refund  they are not allowed to deny service to people who ve already paid.  If this is true then wow. This is like in Socialist Yugoslavia where if you didn t have a picture of Tito hung on the wall overlooking your dining table or openly disagreed with ANYTHING about him  you d either be imprisoned or relocated to another region for  work .  And how about these tough guys on the plane jeering at older women. But hey  as long as you re a white conservative there are no expectations on being treated humanely. These scumbags are true parasites. I d love to see how tough they are one on one with a grown man...  Unreal...  Unbelievable and disgusting. Shocked what is going on right now. They are coming for us and its pure disgusting.  they are coming for us and it is being praised  remind you of anything in relatively recent world history   sure. lots of things. none of them good.  Orwell predicted the future.  I told my husband when he was flying out of dc don t say a single thing about trump I told him the same thing flying In. It s insane that you have to hide your beliefs now days.  I have been sadly hiding for the last 4 years. I m in California and I feel like I m part of an underground resistance  A good portion of my family still lives in the la area my heart goes out to you.  Something something Soviet Russia.  the soyboys yelling get off the plane lmao  This has to be a joke...  They already have no opinions for themselves. They think whatever they are told to think.  Charged with 2 counts of 1st degree whiteness  Here in chicago a vietnamese restaurant was canceled because the owner went to the dc protest. So its not just white people. Its trump supporters in general.  Only white supremacist support trump. I know it  39 s confusing I don  39 t get it as well  but in 21 you can be a Vietnamese white supremacist if needed  This is getting ridiculous  It probably isn t even in delta s policy  just that one leftist flight attendant couldn t stand by without suppressing speech. They should have told him to call the pilot or his manager or something and then he would ve given up for the day  What the fuck  This can  39 t stand.  Cause we are  You gotta make that  quot wedding quot  cake though ....  And it begins.  I heard they also refused to wear masks or something like that.  lawsuit time   Just remember that any form of discrimination it s entitled to a generous compensation in a court of law. Be prepared  be ready for a niece payday.  Fuck Delta.  They  39 ve always sucked.  I refuse to fly them and now I guess I got one more reason.  Fucking tyrants. Do we have enough          removed    removed    removed    removed   Wtf  They should say they are lesbians.  In a few years time talking about Trump will be like talking about Hitler. You will have to be very careful what you say and anything that looks like support or positive praise will be a cancel able offense.

To say that this was comparable to Kristallnacht is highly inappropriate. Even comparing what happened at the capitol to the BLM riots isn t a great comparison.. literally millions of dollars worth of damage with more than 23 people killed  in the span of 7 months. The terminator needs to read a book  preferably 1984   Yeah  Chuck Schumer compared it to Pearl Harbor. Saying it will be another day that  Goes down in history.  These people making such insane comparisons to events in history that changed the course of it forever to some violent rioters vandalizing the Capitol. Don t get me wrong  what happened was awful and those that broke the law should be punished accordingly. To compare it to an attack on our country by a foreign nation in a time of peace that cost the lives of 2000  Americans and the destruction of a huge portion of our naval fleet is a grave disservice to those that died on December 7th  1941.  History of attacks on the white house    Starting ww2 .....or smearing poop on a wall. Yep. SAME.   Pearl harbor didn  39 t start ww2  One politician  don  39 t remember his name  said it was worse than 9 11.  Billions of dollars not just millions  I mean  23 killed in 7 months comes to roughly 0.1 dead people per day vs 5 in one day at the capital.  You  39 re right  it isn  39 t comparable. Expect the non comparison you  39 re lookin for is that Trump supporters defiled government buildings  and BLM businesses. A penalty of 10 years in prison  or so I  39 ve been told.  Both definitely defiled government buildings  just for the record.  There were people at the insurrection wearing Nazi memorabilia. Multiple flags and an Auschwitz hoodie. Those who entered the Capitol had to be very comfortable being around Nazis and Nazi flags.   Says the son of a literal Nazi  He actually talked about that in the video. Talked about how his father would come home drunk and beat him but he thought that was a normal thing because everyone s dad would come home drunk and beat their kids.  I m not sure exactly but isnt he austrian   He is.  Can hardly blame them for not giving him the time of day. Storming the capital was definitely a bad look but no politicians died and the death count was hardly comparable to literal nazis. Nazi is a word thrown around far too carelessly nowadays. More died from the riots this past summer and there was far more damage than what happened in DC. I think politicians are just mad because their workplace got trashed instead of someone else s.

You right. You can see why I stick to machine learning and not biology.  The  em vast  em  majority of the positive tests are asymptomatic. This is supported by the 99.7  survival rate.

Is this a specific excuse that actually gets you out of it   What are they gonna do  dredge the lake   I live near a lake that  39 s around 800m deep. Good luck dredging that.  Search your home   which government agency will be conducting their fascist door to door searches   Well the answer to your first question is the FBI ATF.  they aren  39 t capable of waging a war on America.  I doubt it  most local law enforcement agencies are conservative and aren  39 t going to do that shit  Not if they  39 re in a pool of blood from the guns that were lost in a lake.  Look at the bills in the house right now.  They would absolutely neuter the 2A if passed.  One of them calls for a national registry.  Shits scary.  The legislation is already drafted and ready to go.   a href  https   www.congress.gov bill 117th congress house bill 127  rel  nofollow  A year  could be weeks   a   Yes about that  I doubt there ll be that many that will fight like that when the draconian gun laws start being passed this year  I will.  So will a whole bunch of country boys I know.  What is Forbes gonna do  Write a whiny article no will ever read due to their circulation be in a death spiral   Yeah totally doesn t sound like commie china  ussr  hitler s germany. So on and so on  honestly can t really run out of ample examples.  I m seeing rumors that Trump has signed the Insurrection Act and possible arrests are being made. Curious to see what comes out in the next few hours.  I mean hell has already frozen over  it s snowing right now in southeast Texas  so i could believe just about anything right now.  Lol is it really snowing in SE Texas  That is awesome. I think like most people everyone really just wants to know the truth. Everyone has feelings that stuff isn t quite right up there in Washington. Especially when people like Epstein just walk out of prison years ago and later it s proven he had connections with the world elite and was involved in some bad bad stuff  Wasn t the Pope arrested today   is it Christmas again already   I saw something remarking on it but so far I have not seen anything official myself. I m just seeing rumors and whispers at this point.  Same  trying to do some research...but I m sure if it s true  they re keeping a lid on the information for a bit  I think the Pope rumor may have been started because some users saw  a  possible police car in a live stream. I don t see anything other than that. One person wrote a blog about it because it s seen from his apartment and that it was a street sweeper and he has no reason to believe the blackout arrests etc.   I read that the pope s doctor is covid positive but that s about it  I heard blackout because they were  quot changing roof lights quot  or some such nonsense   a href  https   youtu.be dCDr9ft0Ym4  rel  nofollow  there is indeed a blackout     a   I read that too. Darn   Dark web is either correct or effective at making up a story based around facts.  Probably just effective at making up stories haha  That s a given  although some stuff does leak there first. At this point I think Trumps rolling over  but I do love a good conspiracy theory.  there absolutely is. our military picks up everything that travels over the airwaves.  Yeah I have an acquaintance that works in Military Intelligence and their capabilities are no joke. They wouldn t need special forces to obtain a laptop. They could just grab all the data remotely. Granted I m completely ignorant as to the encryption levels on this particular laptop but it seems highly unlikely they would need to arrange for something like this.  Intel vs making a case would be my guess  The Vatican and Pakistan mysteriously went dark last night..  Why would they arrest the pope  Probably a 4chan rumor troll honestly lol  I don t even see a shred of what could constitute even a hint at this being true.  Iin Wood was the first to say it that I saw.  The Lin Wood who posted THIS to Parler   I qualified it by saying he said it first.  Well  Wood is a nutcase. Rittenhouse would do well to make sure Wood is nowhere near his defense team.  The pope is behind the vote changing in Georgia  try to keep up  What.  This is ridiculous  So... Uhh bear with me here because I looked this up yesterday and it definitely sounds a bit nutty.  Bit of a rabbit hole but it was interesting to say the least.  Child trafficking  Who the heck knows. If it s true  guess we ll find out eventually  I  39 m sure there is stuff someone as powerful as the pope does that would be worthy of it  that said would anyone even bother to investigate  No  Wut  lmao  Yeah I saw a weird one saying he was gonna announce some stuff over the emergency broadcast system  and in the next couple weeks surprising arrests would be made. Then saw another post saying apple was gonna disable the EBS in an iphone update   a href  https   youtu.be n2Ady3z Xy8  https   youtu.be n2Ady3z Xy8  a   Fuck 2020. Any other year I am a calm rational person  but this past year has turned me into a full on conspiracy theorist.  Someone noted yesterday that the term conspiracy theorist was coined by the cia to discredit anyone who questioned their illegal AF operations.  Not sure if it  39 s true  but I wouldn  39 t be surprised at this point.  Like that ever stopped a tech company before.  Yeah but there  39 s a difference between  quot dancing on the grey line of legality quot   and flagrantly disabling the EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYSTEM  or in any way  messing with it.  Witch hunt. Hope these liberals are proud of themselves  Why do people even care about what Forbes says  I m ready to go down with the ship  liberty or death  Just start calling these people fascists cause that  39 s what they are  Sounds like a solid case of harassment.  Sue the Forbes    Target them right back.  When someone declares that they are dead ...  Epitomy of being Racist  
t3_kul32n,Gab Picking Up 10000 Users Per Hour CEO Claims After Trumps Twitter Ban,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kul32n/gab_picking_up_10000_users_per_hour_ceo_claims/,how good is gab  They are their own platform so they can  39 t be deplatformed. They have fought that battle before. They are 100  free speech.  Gab is their own host. They got deplatformed because they are 100  free speech. They even allow hate speech unless it is a direct call to violence if I read correctly.  There are still two ways they can be deplatformed   DNS and ISP.  Both have already been used to deplatform  quot neo Nazi quot  websites.  What do you think they  39 re calling Gab at this point   Are they legit neo nazis or are the edgy 4chan type  in effect not. If enough of these genuine 1A people sign up it would shift the demographic very quickly   They aren t even as bad as 4Chan was  Minds it is then.  We have to battle the neo nazis on their own ground.  The neo nazis don  39 t believe in liberty  We  39 ve got to stop playing defensive.  It  39 s just a matter of time there won  39 t be anywhere to run to.  Okay  but  em how  em     We bring Amazon and Twitter up on class action lawsuits  For following their own ToS  A private company has rights as well  neither are owned by the public. It would be different if they were government ran companies.  They might be hosting out of some random ass country. We don  39 t know they seem to be OK people like Milo are on there for years now.  They have their own servers  not sure where they are located  but a local ISP will be providing them internet service.  The leftist mob or DS could get the ISP to deplatform them.  I think they hid where they are located now because of that  If they are hosted in another country  the president can ban access to the website.  VPN  39 s ignore bans pretty well.  You should read how google define what Gab is      Then it isn  39 t hate speech. That is a flagarant term with no concrete definition. Except of course for real violence  Real violence or inciting is called a  quot call to action quot  which is illegal under 1A. The same for slander and fraud  lying under oath etc  and a couple other things that have no bearing on the website.  None which occured so  But getting deplatformed for hate speech i.e. allowing racial slurs and what not isnt uncommon by most private businesses today. It hurts their image and so they distance themselves as quickly as possible. A company cannot be blamed for excorsizing it  39 s own rights just because it  39 s not concurrent with your own perceived way companies should work.  That  39 s Parler  I m aware. Parler was said to not be deplatformed either. Yet they were.  Everyone knew Parler was going to be deplatformed by Amazon  people that didn  39 t were na ve.  Cool. Sign me up. Oh  I do it myself.  It  39 s unreachable now. Twitter refugees hugged it to death.  It s been crashing all day from the surge of users. Looks just like Twitter.  People pay to use Gab so you are not a product. Fuck all these other sites selling our information. I m so tired of that shit. I don t mind paying for a service.  The people who own gab are the same people who own every other social media platform. In today  39 s world  the number of people who do not pay attention to this stuff is astounding.   If we cannot live on social media together how in the hell can we live in a country together      People are polite in person  when there  39 s the threat of being punched in the face if they mouth off the same way we  39 ve seen online behind anonymous logins and firewalls.  I agree  I am just worried that no good can come from this. People need to be routinely exposed to opinions they disagree with.   That s the plan  Yeah  except leftists always assume that everyone in the room agrees with them so they  39 ll say incendiary things IRL too with the expectation they aren  39 t going to get called on it.  yeah. they can say whatever they want and everyone will agree because no one wants to get knocked out.  I ve experienced this same thing. Even the most hateful liberals when seeing them in person tuck their tail between their legs.  The internet is known for anonymity  which allows people to say whatever they want with little chance for repercussion. The real world is a whole new ball game with every phone having a camera and the newer generations being sue happy.  I am just concerned that the dual social media dichotomy that is rapidly forming can only do more harm than good. It is always better to at least see what people you disagree with think and say on social media.  Itll just split the internet up more into two sides for american politics. In reality itll have no bearing on day to day life unless people start asking  quot hey what  39 s your twitter facebook handle so I can add you quot  then itll just be a precursor to people who are politically motivated to cease talking to you unless required to like at a job.  They might not want it  but I believe we should not give into spiteful temptation  that s what they want us to do.  Gab  39 s description according to Wokepedia   Here s 10 001  Gab has been  quot under maintenance quot  for the past couple of hours. I sincerely hope that really what  39 s going on.  most likely upgrading their servers for the massive waves of people that are joining. I think I saw someone on their post about how they re excited for the new servers or something but I m not sure  It  39 s new servers being setup  Seems like they  39 re setting up new servers because of the surge they  39 ve reported they  39 re experiencing. I  39 ll have to check back tomorrow to see if it  39 s done by then.  Yeah  they came back online after a few hours last night.  Gab needs to think ahead and start decentralizing itself. That is the only future proof solution to the vastly growing problem.  Here  39 s how to install on your phone   Available only on Android  so funny I was telling the wife I wanted to switch to a Samsung next before I get too tied to Apple. I like the more open OS idea.   Ah thank you. I recently switched to Android I  39 m glad I did. However  I wish we had an open source OS without Google  39 s involvement. I know there is some out there  but I  39 m not sure if they are stable.  Lineage OS is the FOSS version of Android  100  agree  it s getting crazy just how much everyone is relying on the big 3  Amazon  Google  Apple .  I  39 m a big believer in  quot niche brand quot  Android phones  but the trouble with them is that with the smaller user base it  39 s harder to find support and instructions for rooting so you can use a FOSS OS  Lineage  replacement.  Ditching Apple on my next upgrade too.  warning  google android is basically spyware  Welcome to 2021     Gab I go  I won  39 t dispute it because everyone likes a place where their 1st amendment rights aren  39 t blocked  I think I m done with social media for a little  when this sub goes I go  Same.  Reddit is all I have left and honestly I  39 ve wanted to delete it for a while.  Twitter was deleted  I never used it anyway  and I don  39 t care to sign up for Gab of it  39 s the same thing.  I always felt Twitter was cancer anyway.  When Gab first launched  I believed it would piss some mainstream people off and then fade into obscurity. But I was wrong  apparently. It  39 s  em exploding.  em   GAB should offer to host Parler.  This is really the best option. I wouldn  39 t be surprised if Gab helps them out or buys them out.  This dude hit the lottery  assuming he doesn  39 t get pulled from the server. Which he probably will be. This is a scary fucking time  even for moderates  who haven  39 t lost their fucking minds  Does GAB have an APP  I cannot seem to find it.  They have been banned from both play store and Ios store. You have to use other ways to install it   a href  https   apps.gab.com application 5d3f982c9dd49a5b1d9fc881  https   apps.gab.com application 5d3f982c9dd49a5b1d9fc881  a .  Yeah  to that  39 s not an app  it  39 s a shortcut to the webpage.  No  you can get the APK file from there.  Do you have to be logged into the site in order to see it  If not  can you tell me how exactly  All I see are instructions on how to place a shortcut from Chrome on the website. I click  quot Web quot  and it takes me to the website. And when I click  quot download history quot  it wants me to login. But I don  39 t see any other links that give me the apk to install on the Android.  If you re on iPhone you can add them to your home screen to at least get to them quickly but yea would be nice to have an app  but blame Apple google.  Thanks  Their servers are being overwhelmed by the traffic  Hopefully the wave of refugees will dramatically improve the quality of the userbase  which has been the main thing holding Gab back up to this point.  CEO is stupid to advertise that  as the pressure will be put on all the corporate and tech assets they rely on.  figure the commies are going to target IT next.  Just tried to join and the server is timing out before confirming membership. Hopefully they re just busy processing requests and not getting shut down.  How do you get Gab   The app on App Store is for Georgetown  They were kicked off the App Store.  You have to go to their website and then add it to your home screen  Thanks  saw the other comments but appreciate the post response   Offer to host parler  pornhub  etc. Other companies that have been recently strong armed by being dependent on big business.  They run their own server  39 s and only use a local ISP which is unknown at this point.  He is saying they should host other websites that have fallen under the same ridicule as theirs would on the open net without their own hosting ability hidden ISP. But bringing in other websites hurts the camouflage that GAB has been using.  How does one even get on gab  I looked in the Apple store and I couldn t find it. I pulled it up online and only could get there if I typed the url in directly  the link from the search engine was loading so slow that I almost thought it was blocked . In either case  I couldn t find a link online and I couldn t find it in the Apple store.  There is no app  just the web page  That explains it. It  39 s going to be hard for that to be a true alternative if it doesn  39 t have an app.  They could make one for android and make a walkthrough on installing apps outside the app store  but for apple it  39 s not possible.  Does gab have an app from the play store or is it all web site driven   Just the website  Yes  they have an app.  They will son be canceled too. Enjoy it while it lasts.  They were cancelled years ago. The CEO knew that the actions of the past few days would happen and that people would flock to them as an oasis since they have developed their own infrastructure. It appears to be paying off.  They own their own servers

As Obama  39 s defense secretary Robert Gates says in his memoir   quot  Biden has  been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades. quot   The larger question is whether Beijing will keep its word.

If we had such a system in America  the left would call it fascist and racist.

It s nature to scare the shit out of them.  Haha this is utter BS. Bomb threat so serious that you don t send anyone home      Just fake outrage after fake outrage lol  Was it Jussie Smollett giving Amazon the hot tip   I obviously don  39 t want to see more violence.  There are rights I would die for and things I wouldn  39 t.  Right now  the election and other things is not worth a civil war  violence or dying for.  I will say  their politically based move to shutdown Parler isn  39 t going to help the current climate.  It is going to make things worse.  Completely agree. Respondomg with violence only proves their point  If they took their safety and these threats seriously  why not send them home    Andddddd this thing is gonna make a head pretty soon a burst..  So they  39 d put their workers in danger   It  39 d be an honest shame if a totally not BLM crowd peacefully protested an Amazon data center.  Oh  bullshit. This is no different than the  quot orchestrated plot quot  to kidnap the governor of Michigan. A bunch of idiots on their keyboards sprouting off some nonsense and the Left using it to further their political agendas. Probably agents of the agencies deliberately seeking to stir the pot.  People on the right don  39 t make threats.  They do or don  39 t do.  Threats are dumb.

She  39 s awful silent on that now.  I ll admit when I m wrong  and Elizabeth Warren was spot on here with exploring anti trusts against them early. Four tech companies can create a cartel and silence anyone they feel.   The scary thing is that their power isn t limited to just this country. It s global. They can change national loyalties at their convenience.  Imagine going into a war cause Jack Dorsey interfered in another countries politics by selective banning and the US Government couldn t do anything.  Could be like a real life Elliot Carver  from James Bond fame   I actually considered voting in their primary for her based on this issue. We re about 20 years past due on kicking the IT trust busting into gear and closer to 50 for banking.  I know its an unpopular opinion  but it will backfire.

t3_kujuzz,Parler CEO Blasts Coordinated Attack by Tech Giants to Kill Competition as Amazon Pulls Its Servers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kujuzz/parler_ceo_blasts_coordinated_attack_by_tech/,Let this be a lesson to any CEO thinking about moving even more of their computing and storage to third party cloud servers.  He s right and I think he has a good case to sue.  He d lose.  Twitter stock drops after they ban Trump and suddenly multiple megacorps simultaneously shut down their biggest competition.  You d have to prove in a court of law that these companies colluded against Parler to squeeze them out of the market instead of just upholding their service agreements.  We already saw Zuckerberg crap himself in front of Congress when asked about Facebook and Twitter colluding to censor people.  they have already admitted to sharing information like this in previous senate hearings.  the antitrust suits are already happening. and a bunch of congresspeople from both sides have talked about the antitrust today.  they were also talking criminal acts too  like civil violations. I could see that taking hold possibly.  Who did Ma Bell collude with   Service agreements don  39 t mean jack shit against an anti trust lawsuit.  The us government is going to be the one suing not parler  in antitrust   Parler v. Amazon  sure Parler would lose.  A breach of contract claim would fail.  Other causes of action are viable.  That would be fine if any of these things happened on a 1 1 basis  but this is clear cooperation between the tech companies to do this  anticompetitive collusion is illegal  They 100  have a reasonable case for an antitrust lawsuit. It would be pretty easy to find other apps or websites that have either the same or worse content and show they are being singled out  They could try  but unlikely to succeed.  they have already filed the antitrust lawsuit against google and even californias attorney general joined. it is 100  happening. the rest probably soon to follow  That s an article from December  that doesn t involve Parler. It s a totally separate suit on a totally separate issue.  Twitter itself has had some bad stuff recently.  Doesn t matter. The contract can t trump statute as a matter of law. For instance  Reddit can t put in its user agreement that they can boot you for being a particular race. Similarly  Amazon can t use its user agreement to circumvent the various anti trust statues. Now  I m not as certain of these facts making for a great case but if  for instance  discovery revealed the various tech giants getting together to orchestrate this ... well  that would be illegal on its face.  I  39 d disagree.Reasoning under Common law.    Amazon  39 s failure to give Parler a  quot commercially reasonable quot  period to  em cure  em  is also somewhat suspect. Given they canceled them over a weekend with very little notice.  Supposedly Amazon has been in talks with Parler since November about this issue  so not exactly sudden.  I  39 d really like to see what the  quot violent content quot  that they reported to Parler actually looked like. While I  39 m sure some of it is legitimate  I have my doubts that the content that Parler did not choose to remove actually included violence.  I  39 d bet money that for ever message on parler promoting violence you  39 d find a tweet to match.  I also wouldn  39 t be surprised if their definition of  quot violent speech quot  didn  39 t also include things they just don  39 t like so they can point and go  quot SEEEEEEE THEY DIDN  39 T TAKE DOWN EVERYTHING WE REPORTED quot .  Meanwhile there  39 s a thriving pedophile community on twitter that somehow never gets touched among other things.   As long as they aren  39 t right wing pedos then its all good apparently  Yeah  and AWS can t say a couple screenshots of bad posts were observed. Bad posts occur on literally every platform and are eventually removed through some moderation system. Parler was likely overwhelmed with new users in the past week. Seems bad faith to cherry pick some posts and boot them.  You can still sue for anti trust reasons  Just because you have an agreement that says you can do whatever you want does not mean you are no longer required to follow the laws.  Plenty of contracts are ignored by courts because they know it s unconstitutional.  Right  but what s unconstitutional about Apple  Google and Amazon saying  em  we don t want to do business with you anymore   em    I m not a lawyer but I know a monopoly when I see one.  Agreements also can t just be broken when nothing was done to break them except you don t like their beliefs.  That s persecution and prejudice.  You should probably read the agreements. Amazon says they can break the agreement for any reason  or no reason  in 30 days. By using Amazon s services  Parler agreed to that agreement.  As much as I agree with your position  unfortunately political beliefs are not a protected category  and first amendment does not apply to private transactions and spaces.  Service agreement or no  I think they have a case.  Correct me if I  39 m wrong but anti trust laws are still anti trust laws  if he can prove that they removed him to keep alternatives to Twitter down no 5k terms and servuce page of 300 lawyers can stop that from being the truth.  Yes but he d have to prove that Amazon  Apple  and or Google colluded with Twitter to destroy his company.  Crazy how the left have been bitching about Trump being an existential threat for 4 years  but are cheering this shit which is against everything our country stands for.

They re not even comparable at this point  Okay  who gave Nancy the wine bottle opener   It was right next to her 20 000 dollar fridge and 500 dollar cooler  I was gonna make a joke.. but in all honesty  if I had her kind of money  I  39 d also own a  20k fridge. Hell  I allready own a Yeti cooler for hunting and fishing haha.  Is the Yeti really that badass   Yes. I got one because sometimes I am away from any electricity civilization for a week or more. The Yeti will indeed keep the ice frozen for that long. It has paid for itself  I think I spent  400  six seven years ago   many times over.  Woh  In my day we d steal a cooler to get at the beer. Now the cooler itself is the hot commodity    Ha  Yeah. I guess I was better behaved. I  39 d just take the beer  and I knew the owner. Thanks dad   I can confirm. It really is   I bought the Yeti when I was a single man... now that I have a kid  I can relate. If you were worried about ice lasting a week  I take it you weren  39 t at Camp Pleasureneck  land of wifi and ice cream .  Bahaha  literally cackling at that one. No no I wasn  39 t.  But I will digress as i was aircrew on the black helicopters  so we had it good for the most part  they just liked pushing out to where a perimeter was a roll of razor wire  and water points were in   39 town  39  and run by the afghans.  Baghhh good times in the wild west.  I was in a not nice Helmand fob and crapped in a plastic bag most days  war changes a man . But once a month  I was able to fly to Leatherneck to get crypto for the radios. I have a picture of steak and lobster dinner hahaha. I still sometimes have dreams about how great Mongolian bbq night was.   Hats off to those in the helmand  he  39 ll of a fireworks show more days than not in that area.  Ive got a few airborne shits  ammo cans and boxes here  under my belt  but no comparison to those who did it for months on end.  Oh hell  it was a long time ago. I remember pitching a bitch and the chief told me  quot if it stops leaking  that  39 s when you need to be worried. quot  Still makes me laugh.  Didn t she support violent riots this summer   If Trump is impeached then Waters  Pelosi  Schumer  AOC  and many others must also be removed for same reason.  Projection. I figured out this was Nixon Watergate when you consider big tech is coordinating at the Democrat Party s request.  They  39 re going to do it but they have no grounds. Opposing or questioning election results is not impeachable.  And he absolutely did not tell anyone to storm the Capitol.  If they  39 re going off of evidence  not hate  they have no case.  But  they do whatever they want and don  39 t abide by law  They  39 ll never get to a trial before he leaves office  but if I was Trump  39 s lawyer during an impeachment trial my opening statement would simply be  em every single statement  em  Democrats have made in support of the riots all throughout 2020 and ask where the impeachment for them was.  Yep.  Along with the exact words from Trump  39 s speech that day where he specifically said  be peaceful.  That alone  in realville  should end it.  Why are they talking about this   The guy is out in 10 days  I  39 d imagine he  39 d already be out of office by the time hearings and votes are all wrapped up  From what I ve been able to learn  they could prevent him from running for office again. Additionally  if they were to actually remove him  he loses secret service protection  among other fringe benefits like pension  etc.  not that he d actually take the money I imagine since he s only making  1 year right now .  He trusts his own security more anyway.  It won  39 t work again  Nancy is wasting her breath...  Says the woman who attempted to stage a coup.  Fuck off  Pelosi

Why the fuck is Marriot donating to political candidates  LOL.  I believe that  39 s an output of Citizens United  there  39 s a good chance I  39 m wrong .   Damn  seems like conservatives were wrong about this one...  Oh I know why  and thanks for posting for others. I just think it makes zero sense. Like  Burger King probably donates to political campaigns now and I get the principle  I just don  39 t understand the practice. Politicians should represent the people  not corporations. Framers really gave fuck all about it  and for good reason.  Also  the double standard in objecting to election results.  Jamie Raskin  Permila Jayapal  Barbara Lee  Sheila Jackson  Raul Grijalva  and Maxine Waters all objected to the 2016 certification. Maxine Waters also objected in 2000 and 2004.  Well put.  Like any other large industry  they donate and lobby their business goals succeed.  But Marriot will keep spamming my phone with robocalls.  Like every single day. The nerve of these asshats.  LPT  Listen to the call all the way through and at the end you can opt out.  Thank you  thank you  thank you...  Those are scam callers  I wonder if they gave back donations to all the Democrats who spent the last four years braying about Trump not being a legitimate president of the United States   a claim underwritten by the ridiculous and utterly disproven conspiracy theory of Russian alteration of election results.   We have reached an unbelievable level of political hypocrisy now  haven  39 t we  For 4 years  we got cries of Russian collusion. We were told that Russia hacked the election. Leftists said Trump  39 s election was illegitimate. If you didn  39 t subscribe to the opinion of Russian interference  you were seen as being complicit in the destruction of American democracy.  That  39 s a scam though  right  I don  39 t think the hotel is behind those calls.  I suspend my donations to marriott   deleted   Well said  glad my va benefits are tax free  and I try my hardest to trade my sawmill work for silver gold and lead hahah  Same  Why does the establishment resort to cancel culture  Because they think there won t be any counter cancellations. Let s make sure that isn t true.  Except Marriott is Mormon and conservative and Republican so...there s that.  Yeah  I m not sure why they d think Marriott is liberal if they re donating to republican senators in the first place.  Yeah  they pretty much know most will forget in a month or two. Let  39 s not forget and take names like they are.  Doesn t Romney have deep ties to the Marriott  This is probably the most expected move then.  If they are consistent they would cut off those who were part of the  not my president  movement too  but I will not hold my breath  Remember when the MSM said that our president was a Russian agent for 3 years    I also remember when Sheila Jackson Lee  Maxine Waters  Pramila Jayapal  and several others objected to Trump  39 s certification in 2016.  Remember when outgoing Attorney General Lynch called for blood in the streets   Funny they have riot in their name lol  Just noticed that  What about the Democratic members of Congress that challenged the Electoral College in 2000  2004  and 2016  aka every Republican win this century   Are they banned from receiving donations  too    deleted   Marriott is Goose Stepping  didnt the Soviets have a similar leg thing in their parade marching      Cool  I travel frequently for work  have  titanium elite  status with them. I ll just give my business back to Hilton.  I prefer Hilton anyway.  I prefer the Howard Johnson. I like the smell of stale cigarettes and the faint sound of an abusive couple yelling at each other in the background as I fall asleep into my 50 thread count sheets  That s right. I want to feel like I m at home when I m traveling.  I do too tbh  for whatever reason my business prefers Marriott and when they schedule stuff for me they often choose Marriott by default. But I can request whatever hotel I want within a certain price range  which Marriott and Hilton are usually close in price  plus on many trips just do the scheduling myself.   Oh yea. I m still not stupid about sharing personal info on here  but it s refreshing to know that I work for a company that s never gonna go  woke . If I got doxed for being at a Trump rally or similar and they called my boss about it  guarantee you he d use the word  snowflake  before hanging up on them  then call me and laugh about it.   Must be nice. My wife s company gets almost daily emails from their CEO with his thinly veiled political views. They suffered actual damage from the BLM riots and have bent over backwards to appease  while the recent events at the Capitol were  of course  the worst thing ever.  Titanium elite with Ambassador here.   I was just thinking the same thing.  These businesses are choosing sides in the next civil war.  Pay attention  this is going downhill fast.  Just wait until the democrats start forcing marriotts to be a homeless shelter. Yes its happening in the state of Washington to certain hotels.  I m tired of every business and corporation going political. Hopefully that ll change now that their boogeyman Trump is out of office. Like just let me stay in your hotels Marriott.   removed   I do not.... where  39 s my donation Marriott   Worth a try right   I don  39 t even need a donation. Just a 25  discount and free hot breakfast.  Yeah...the free hot breakfast has been suspended until COVID goes away.  Question nothing peasant. Politburo has decided. Accept it or gulag for you.  America is beyond corrupt.  Marriott is owned but a prominent Mormon and has strong ties to Romney. What is with all these loser Mormons in the political world  Did the Marriot leadership take this stance when the Democrats refused to accept Trump  39 s win in 2016   when this is over remember everyone that sided with the traitors.  Screw all of those companies  keep corporate money out of politics.  They can do without my stays. I know a lot of people who will avoid them.

Doesn t apple benefit from child labor and slave labor in China   I guess investigating or questioning wrong doings is a no no  Show me who they supported.  Mitt Romney was on Marriott s board a few times. I don t think he is anymore but probably made a call or two...  The worst thing about this is the other chains are worse.  Sure  you could switch from Marriott to Hilton  but all that gets you is non stop cnn and MSNBC in the lobby  and active donations to tides and AOC.  Age of conservatism and pro americanism is dead. When american companies are anti american and they rather do business in china than here  we have lost. I have to find a new home. Again.  Obey and submit  or else.  There s no such thing as bias against conservatives   RESIST  I guess they don t care about making money....  They do and they have calculated that this won  39 t hurt them.

Again  the entire business world knows this.  And that  39 s the problem. The only way to show these assholes whose in charge is to hit them where it hurts the most  their pockets. If leftists can bitch and moan publicly and get what they want  which is bizarre to me in the first place  why can  39 t we do it privately  with our wallets  I bet they will change the narrative real quick.   There are at least 75 million of us and we tend to be the ones with the money and the jobs and the reasons to travel. If we all pulled our business from Marriott  they would feel it.  There are other hotels out there. I  39 d rather give them my business to stay quiet and true to their business rather than support a business that limits free speech or to express their own views in a country that actually allows you to do so.  Nah this will result in a massive boycott of Marriott  narrator  it won  39 t  You try having autism  ADHD  and a constant sense of boredom that only goes away if you re on your phone or video games. It s painful for me and I m a conservative soon to be independent but still on President Trump s side after the GOP went and backed the bus right over him and fell right into Antifa s stupid ass trap.  People keep getting confused by how this works   so let me break it down for you.  Thanks for posting.

Just gather the votes.   How do their actions have anything remotely to do with racketeering  You can argue it  39 s monopoly abuse  but that doesn  39 t imply racketeering.  I d say more cartel behavior than racketeering  They  39 re not threatening to bankrupt them  they  39 re threatening to stop serving them as a customer. There are plenty of other hosting providers out there. If all alternative providers refuse to serve them  it either indicates that the companies are all participating in anti competitive collusion  or there  39 s something innate to all providers that deters them from wanting to sell services to parler. The former is criminal but seems unlikely. The latter is perfectly legal and very common.  Honestly AWS and others do have a point. Read some of the emails with Parler and they were slow to react with moderation.  i dont see how this is racketeering....  Day late and a dollar short you dumb fucks. You had the chance to put the leash on months ago. Good luck now  The left   quot ThErEs nO StAnDiNg quot   Yes  RICO the bastards   This would be a good case  but too many judges are crooked   quot No Standing quot   Absolute fk all will happen.. fk all these  quot investigations quot  just more political theatre.. whos gonna be held accountable  NOONE.

They love to justly call out the big tech companies and call them before Congress in order to create viral moments. However  when it comes to actually doing something to stop them it s always an empty bag  This is such a text book example of anti trust law violations. All of these tech giants just happen to stop doing business with an upcoming competitor all at the same time  Give me a break.  I see downvotes.

Trump asked for using the law to  quot put down quot  rioters  violent protest  and insurrectionist for months. Trump put laws in place to protect monuments and offered assistance to stop violent protests.  Nothing happens in a vacuum  no matter how shortsighted people want to be  It s the question of  how long would you tolerate someone telling you to shut up when you re in a room full of people talking   Chances are you wouldn t last 4 years.  Well  if the left had actually held itself to its own standards we ve seen this past week maybe we could have avoided this riot. Instead we got  rioting is the voice of the unheard  for months and further escalation.  No you dont understand. Rioting is ok when I personally agree with it.  If you haven  39 t noticed the last 4 years that Democrats will do anything if they think it will help them politically. There is nothing they won  39 t do. Which is scary because they are going more towards communism and fascism as time goes on.  This is an important bfact that we need to understand soon. They have decided that the ends justify the means. They have decided that they are rightous and whatever they do to svheive their rightous goal for the betterment of all is acceptable  because they are going to gi e it to us weather we want it or not  Not that that makes it okay. We still need to hold ourselves to our own standards. What I resent is the implication that Conan the Barbarian guy represents the entire right  but BLM is  quot mostly peaceful quot .  I think it is a simple test of character.  If someone apologized for one set of riots and denounced the other they ve simply given themselves away as partisans.  Listen  you only get to have free speech if you agree with the narrative. They can and have banned a sitting US president.  I m kind of a hypocrite. I used to be so angry when I would see cities succumb to rioting because it hurt innocent people. And then nothing ever came of it to stop them or punish the people who encouraged and enabled it. Governments catered to the demands of protestors who damn near always had a riot attached to any gathering. Big tech gave endowments  and politicians and their aides helped spring people who rioted.   Yep.  It  39 s real hard to feel bad about it  even though intellectually I understand it was politically foolish and in general I disapprove of riots.  DC painted Black Lives Matter on the street in front of the White House and named a plaza after them.  It is incredible that the mayor of DC Muriel Bowser found her fake indignation over what happened.  Yea  It s not like they normalized mob riots this year or anything  s  Lol at Carmen Best defending BLM  the same group that defunded her and forced her out of her job.   Don t they know that you aren t allowed to think critically and connect dots  Left normalizes rioting and violence for a whole summer. Not a single Democrat denounced the White House riot that burned monuments and injured 50 Secret Service agents. Nope  they have no blame in normalizing that type of behavior in the U.S.   Yes  the far left is partly to blame. It  39 s their double standards that made this happen. Their complete disregard for voter fraud and irregularities no matter who wins the presidency. The fact that they have the MSM and social media giants to help them is what made this.  More than partly. they are the ones with hateful rhetoric. Notice too after the capitol incident  instead of talking about how sad the deaths are  Hillary is trolling trump on twitter  talking about how he can  39 t tweet anymore.

From the National Review  eh  I didn  39 t click the link  are they mildly approving of BLM  39 s stance  or very approving   How is it that the numbers have been halved by the time the riots were over the death count was over 40 and the property damage was over 2 billion.  Manipulation  Well  they haven t seen anything yet. Keep stripping away people s rights and backing them into a corner.  You can  39 t  quot Invade quot  property that you own.  What does that have to do with anything    We have a generalized sense of ownership of our government  which does not translate into the ability to go wherever we want or break whatever we want.    I m not sure I follow the distinction.  How is the capitol building not infrastructure     
t3_kvaryn,Donald J. Trump  United States Department of State,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvaryn/donald_j_trump_united_states_department_of_state/,Not sure what to say about this until we hear from President Trump himself. The timestamp is for 19 49 00  and five minutes ago it said 19 39 28  so I  39 m guessing either something will happen sometime around 7pm 8pm EST or there  39 s something wrong with the website.  wtf   Quoted from someone on Neo Gaf   a href  https   twitter.com christopherjm status 1348725601335717889 s 21  https   twitter.com christopherjm status 1348725601335717889 s 21  a   Good find  Awarded.

Makes absolutely no sense otherwise  Oh no  This movie is getting good.....  I cant wait for the big fight scene to start.   s   Wouldn  39 t something like this leak   That  39 s like 4 hours from now.. right   Its just a placeholder.  Sounds like he is resigning. Thank you for your service these last 4 years Mr President.  That sounds like a threat imo  Okay. What in the world is going on   Probably threats to nuke the country if he doesn  39 t step down or if he releases the wrong information.  Disgruntled staffer

t3_kuggey,Mexicos President Blasts Twitter amp Facebook For Acting Like Holy Inquisition In Censoring Trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuggey/mexicos_president_blasts_twitter_facebook_for/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  rel  nofollow  https   discord.gg conservative  a   No  r  politics told me this is a good thing.   quot Seeing all these massive multinational corporations acting in tandem to enforce their will upon the world makes me so happy  quot  A self avowed leftist.  Love how they also claim to be against big business at the same time.  Didn  39 t work for the CEO of Goya...  Goya MADE money from all that attention... I even made a point of buying some more of their products. I am not seeing  the downside  if that is what you are inferring.  No not a downside at all.  Didn  39 t prevent the SJWs from going after him though.  Same with Chic fil a...  most profitable fast food chain and look at all the crap thrown at them.  Ah  yes. Good point. They did try to drag them both through the mud... what a spectacular backfire     Who said that  That  39 s uh...crazy  especially for a leftist  someone who almost certainly rails against corporations on the reg.   removed   What s the end game for us conservatives  It is apparent that any dissent from a liberal view is being censored and removed from the most popular form of communication. I see a lot of complaining and memes but no real plan for the future. How exactly are we going to get our message to undecided voters in 2022 2024    I have found that it seems to come from a naive notion that who is right  and who is wrong is trivial to determine. So you just ban the wrong person. So yes  teens and 20 somethings who have no clue about the real world. I would also add no intellectual humility.  The problem is they were taught from the womb that freedom of expression is more valuable and correct than freedom of thought and speech. It s OK to say you re a woman when you re actual a male  but to say that saying that is maybe a mental health issue is considered  hate speech.   When you tear out a man s tongue  you re not proving him a liar   You re saying you fear his words      They were taught that tolerance means that you must be affirmed instead of simply tolerated.  It s a free market thing  Well see  he incited a terrorist group to try to overthrow democracy. He totally done it. Don t even look into it  Is this what the voices told you   It was a joke. That s the point haha  Sorry  I shouldn  39 t have assumed.  When Mexico cares more about freedom than many lawmakers in the US do...  Well technically this isn  39 t government silencing the voice of opposition.  I don  39 t think it  39 s illegal either.  Glad I don  39 t have a Twitter account though.  I think they shouldn  39 t do what they are doing.  If you have a Twitter account and disagree with a Twitters policy or action I suggest deleting your account in protest along with Facebook.  It s not illegal  but I definitely think it s ripe for criticism  Well then let s remove section 230 from the law protecting them. If they want to regulate what is on their platform  Do so. But let s not give them immunities when they pick and choose what s allowed to stay or not stay  President Trump wanted to do so yet only a  few in Congress were brave enough to stand with him   It s nothing about bravery and all about that      And control.    Because reforming 230 would do more good than eliminating it. That would be my guess. But definitely bunch of RINOs in congress angway.  I  39 m not sure how a libertarian would rather hold the corporations accountable for actions of individuals.  Oh I did drop Fecalbook  Twatter  The Gram... all quite awhile ago.  I saw the writing on the wall way before this.  Me too. I was banned from Twitter almost 2 years ago. I quit Facebook Instagram  and pretty much everything else  over a year ago. I never used TikTok  WhatsApp  or anything Apple related.   I ve heard of Gab.  Going to check it out     Fortunately  these guys are not on any app store. They were attacked by big tech in 2018. They vowed they would not be silenced  amp  built their own servers and platform.   Hey thanks    I can  39 t find it on the android store  What  39 s the icon   I just pissed myself    Fecalbook    I ve heard ppl call it Farcebook too    Naw you had me at fecalbook let  39 s not ruin a good thing     Twitter and Facebook were both funded with government seed money. Along with google. Where  39 s the line between private and public   I don  39 t have an issue with those platforms banning people they don  39 t like. I have an issue with those platforms going after other platforms and forcing them to shut down bc people they don  39 t like use them.  Nice quote. Truman is my favorite president.     That s pretty sad  isn t it   This is an example of a rarity. Big tech  figuratively  owns most of the world. They could seriously fuck up his life.  I like AMLO. Hasn t been the boogeyman the corporatists in Mexico made him out to be.  They only said that because he was willing to go toe to tor with the cartels  who hold major power I Mexico. From what I  39 ve heard  limited since the media doesnt talk about Mexico much   he has been a very good president for Mexico. And yes  he has brass balls.  Go toe to toe  He  39 s been criticized for his peaceful approach to the cartels.  quot abrazos no balazos quot  hugs not bullets lmao  You can stand up and fight against something without literally sacrificing half your countries military and police force  since that s what it would take to forcibly remove the cartels  How else would you stop the cartels though  Think about that. Legalizing drugs is only going to make a tiny dent to be their business operations. Legalizing drugs would  39 ve made a serious impact in 80s or 90s but not no now.  Drugs are the lifeblood of the cartels. The sums of money involved are unfathomable. Organized crime would no doubt continue to exist and operate but the scale of corruption would drop dramatically.  Like I said  that would  39 ve worked in the 80  39 s or 90  39 s. The drug cartels are at a point where they  39 ve diversified their sources of revenue. They  39 ve entered the sex trafficking business  stealing natural resources and other things.  Legalizing drugs would just make the drug cartels a legitimate business. They  39 ll be the ones making money off of all the legal weed shops and suchlike. People don  39 t realize how deep the corruption goes down in mexico.  And if they somehow did end up losing money by selling drugs  they d just make up for it with more trafficking.  I  39 m not conservative  but you  39 re right. AMLO draws a lot of hate from the corporatists. But even the lower middle class. I have some wealthy friends in Mexico who hate him with a passion  understandably so  as his policies don  39 t help them. But even my less financially stable friends and family hate him  which makes no sense at all. One of them now has a pension  who under previous presidents did not. And another has medication who previously didn  39 t. Just mind baffling  I m sure it s similar issues here. Corporate media shitting on anyone who rocks the boat and actually cares for its people.  We are rightly being lectured about civil liberties by Mexico.   I jokingly told my wife we had arrived to the land of the free when arriving in Mexico recently. I feel economic freedom is great in America  but we live in a nanny state otherwise that doesn  39 t respect people enough to behave themselves on their own.  Corrupt countries are freer in many ways as long you can afford to purchase that freedom.  I think you make a valid point. I guess I am a bit jaded being from the land of laws for everything  California . It was until about a decade ago you could even enjoy a beer on the beach in my city  but some bad actors and a heavy dose of Nimbys got that banned as well. Certainly things like freedom of religion speech expression are more fundamentally important and significant. I just am saddened that In some ways I feel more free during my daily activities when I  39 m outside of the US at times.  Lol when Mexico knows we  39 re fucked  we  39 re fucked.  its upto the sane people of this country then to un fuck things.  When Mexico stands up for Trump  someone advocating building a wall  you know liberals are the real fascists  Absolutely. Curious to see their pitiful attempts at spinning the justification for Twitter and big tech on this one.  Based on their playbook they will either  Then three days from now they will say it s old news.  They ll say it s not real censorship  Even some people in here say that. But  you can t just say to start your own platforms if you don t like it. Look at what s happening with Parler.  Twitter is like cocaine.  It  39 s social media and very addictive.  If you start using cocaine it feels good and you want more.  You know it  39 s bad but you..... just....can  39 t....stop.....  I bailed a long time ago. I joined to follow some of my favorite F1 drivers  my favorite author  and a couple of other people. That placed might as well be called eCalifornia.  That  39 s word  It s a private company is a popular one.  Agreed it  39 s a private company but should not be protected under section 230.  Yup  and followed by comparing it to the mom and pop bakery refusing to bake a cake for a gay couple.  They aren  39 t private companies. They are publicly traded on the stock exchange  therefore  have shareholders.  Their shareholders could bring an antitrust lawsuit. Or  some other type of lawsuit.  They have  quot screwed the pooch quot   Fiduciary responsibilities would be the concern of the lawsuit.  Hmm I don t think their shareholders will but one can dream.  I was going to say I thought Mexico  39 s president was liberal so as the article suggests this is a pretty rate occurrence. I hope others speak up like he has  They only went after Trump now because he  39 s an easy target after everything that happened so I don  39 t expect people speaking up even though they should. It  39 s a dangerous precedent after all but people are either too scared or too shortsighted to say something.  Well  he also backed Trump when it came to election integrity and didn t go along with the Office of the President Elect Biden BS.  Looks like I ll be moving to Mexico soon  Guns are illegal  and if you have enough money to get something nice the cartel will sho up and just take it. If you express a problem about them taking your stuff they will just kill you and your whole family.  At least it s heavily conservative and catholic. two big wins  I also consider seriously to leave my country and even my continent Europe entirely in the next few years  due to lockdown mania. I would have considered the US states without much restrictions  like Texas  Florida or Arizona. But it looks like it could become worse with Democrats and Establishment Reps being in charge  who want a nation wide lockdown. I know the law normally prevents that  but we now know those now in charge try to act above the law and disregard it. If it were sure it will not happen and those plans will be shattered  then the free parts of the US would be really serious consideration.  The way things are going I can see the day where I have to at least leave my state Pa .  Nobody expects the holy inquisition.  Once our government can easily work with tech to suppress it  39 s own citizens  it will be child  39 s play doing it against other countries.  Corporate virtue signaling is what I see now. Companies just joining in so they won  39 t be called out as supporting Trump. They have to show they banned him to prove they didn  39 t support him  or risk the cancel culture coming their way.  the problem facing America is that large number of Americans do not actually believe in freedom.  I would say they don  39 t  em understand  em  freedom. They don  39 t realize that what gives them the freedom to  quot cancel quot  opposing viewpoints is the same thing that allows those opposing viewpoints to be heard.  I was taught from a young age  things like personal responsibility and accountability. Phrases like   39 I dont support what you say  but I will fight for your right to say ut.  39    39 Character is who you are when one one  39 s looking.  39  Innocence until proven guilty and the right to bear arms. Dont judge a person by the color of their skin but by the content if their character.      I always respect the logical views on both sides of the fence. I respect the Mexican president for this  a lot. Even Alex Navalny agreed on the same topic. However  the news isn t reporting his view much.   These  private companies  have huge lobbying operations and a revolving door of executives moving between them and Democrat administrations  the incoming worse than ever.  We are on dangerous path my friends.  To everyone calling President Trump a dictator  a dictator can t be censored   The one doing the censoring is the dictator   I ve told these clowns for years that if Trump was a dictator they wouldn t be allowed to speak out against him. Lol  They know this  the double speak is on purpose.  Its Psyops   quot I  39 m not hitting you quot  while they sitting on your chest wailing on your head.  Worst dictator ever   Lol.. yes true    I  39 m sure many of us will face a learning curve over the next four years what with the third world country we  39 re living in now.  quot Stand here  don  39 t write that  do this  don  39 t say that  and no soup for you  quot   Here  39 s the thing though  as much as I don  39 t like the idea of people being censored  a private company has the right to refuse services as long as it  39 s not based off discrimination. So wouldn  39 t the real conservative position be being okay with twitter exercising their rights as a privately run company   Yes it is true. However the concern is that they now hold so much power over people and corporations. To me this is an example of when the gov needs to regulate capitalism  like what happened at the turn of the last century with monopolies in food and steel. Social media giants own monopolies on public opinion now and they need to be dissolved.  The bans are overly broad. William F Buckley believed certain kinds of people  em should  em  be excluded from civil society  but this largely feels like an effort to silence conservative voices more than it is a genuine attempt to deplatform views beyond the pale.  You  39 re right  as evidenced by the fact that  WalkAway has been banned. That organization is just a collection of people who left the Democratic party and their testimonies.  When a leftist leader of a borderline 3rd world country is getting worried over how American Democrats are acting that is a tell tale sign that they  39 ve gone way too far.  It would be nice if more leaders had the balls to say things like that.  The Inquisition had NOTHING on what Communists are capable of.  I ve increasingly thought that if I were a leader of another country and I saw all this go on in the US  my response would be to declare these companies a non state actor and security threat and then either ban them outright or begin taking steps to do so. This type of action is an existential threat in that they re non state actors with more power than elected officials in many cases  certainly with the power to ban elected officials from something approaching the equivalent of the public square and clearly with the ability to bend and distort reality. That power is pretty significant and carries significant threat as we ve seen. I suppose I m just musing but I ve gotten where the words don t mean much without corresponding action. I appreciate he s willing to say this but if he doesn t do something  it doesn t appear as much more than empty words.  I predict another  quot cleansing quot  of a country  39 s leader.  Sold all my Facebook holdings since 2014  no interest being associated with where things are going to go next  I have a much more positive opinion of the inquisition than of twitter  That  39 s good to hear  I honestly can  39 t stand how people are celebrating this.   removed   Lib Media       removed   But it scared their politicians  how dare they   Plus they didn  39 t exactly make it hard to get in. Only first wave of people that pushed their way through should be considered rioters. Most people were just walking around.  No fires  no widescale looting. A laptop  some tchotchke  these people were pikers compared to BLM. That bunch would have left the Capitol looking like the German parliment after the Reichstag fire.  Are we not gonna mention the cop who was crushed to death    The strangest  maybe even funny  picture I saw was the one of the  so called rioters  staying calmly inside the velvet walkway inside the capital.  Would BLM Antifa respect the visitor tourist walkway partition    Well they keep calling it a  quot coup quot  or an insurrection  when it  39 s clear it was not an organized movement. Most of the people that went in did so because they were let in by the Capitol police as nonviolent protestors. There were only a small handful of people who had delusions of grandeur to take hostages and crap  and who were getting riled up with emotion.  road to communism  Uh oh. What the hell is Twitter  Facebook  and Amazon supposed to do now  Someone with more privilege points than them has expressed concern for the situation. If they don t listen to them and change  they will be racist. That s the rules that those idiots play by.  Ban Twitter and Facebook in your country before it happens to you  Mexico  39 s president recognizes fascism... why can  39 t Democrats   Kind of sad even Mexico realizes this is an assault freedom of speech but America can  39 t.  Look. I  39 ll admit  I  39 m not a perfect man. I have biases  and flawed opinions. I  39 m only 29.  Agreed but I still don t care for AMLO.  Abrazos no balas  is perhaps the dumbest thing I ve ever heard a politician of a country with a violence problem say to address the violence in his country.  You know you fucked up when Mexico is on Trump  39 s side lol  Stability of America is important to them  Did anyone else see this at the top of  a href   r all  rel  nofollow  r all  a  then suddenly be removed from the front page entirely   Wow... the admin mods active censoring  not surprised one bit   When are Iran  39 s terrorist leaders and ANTIFA getting banned  Never   Seriously you expect Hypocrisy to be a ethics problem to Leftists     Hacer grande a M xico de nuevo   MMGA     Jesus.

t3_kv7tqk,Manchin Changes Tune on DC Puerto Rico Statehood,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv7tqk/manchin_changes_tune_on_dc_puerto_rico_statehood/,I support PR statehood insofar as the people there want it.  It  39 s their right to join the Union instead of just being a colony   self determination and all that.  However  I vehemently disagree with any push for DC to be a state.  Those who suggest something that idiotic need to reread the Constitution.  DC is supposed to be separate from all the states by design.  Its only purpose is to be the seat of the government  not as a normal place for people to live.  Anyone who thought he would keep the Dem  39 s in check  he  39 ll be another sellout just like the rest of them.  How is that changing his tune   Hes basically saying the same thing he said before  he doesn  39 t know enough about the situations and would listen to the debates.  We should be pushing to grant puerto rico independence. Nothing but a money pit looking to be supported by the United States. Time to treat them like a 35 year old snow flake living in their parents basement and cut them off.  I mean he pretty much said the same thing in both interviews cited in that article. I hope he sticks to his word on the filabuster and courts though.  Even assuming we somehow manage to have free and fair elections in this country again  we are SCREWED if this happens. That is 4 more Dem Sens. Bye bye Senate in our lifetime.   Granting them   Do these people not understand that the constitution plainly lays out the path to statehood and they don t have votes.  They can t just  grant  anything...  He probably knows this would never get past the state legislatures anyway.

Goodbye   He  39 s only ever been a member of the Raytheon Lockheed Party  He was a republican   when politically convenient. like most neocons.  I would say yes  but as we all know not all republicans are conservative.  He hasn t been a Republican for years  Him and people of his ilk were basically honorary Democrats under the Republican banner. I wish more of these fake Republicans would finally admit they  39 re not in the party.  Another spineless coward joins the other side...  Republican Party is a big tent catch all party. Religious people  business people  gun owners  some Libertarians  etc. It  39 s kind of a mess. Saying  quot I  39 m a Republican quot  means fuck all nothing. I joined the GOP a few years ago so I could have a say in my states  39  primaries. If you say  quot I  39 m a Republican quot  I might be able to guess where you stand on a third of the issues.  No surprise... he was a RINO that was constantly sliding towards full liberalism  The dude has 2 weeks left  and has said he doesn  39 t support the Capital attacks. What more do you want from the dude   The Dude have a 75mil followers  many of which are gun owners. So they want him to disappear. Preferably  cursed by his own supporters.

t3_kulxor,I wonder if Alexandria OcasioCortez will be banned from Twitter and expelled from the House of Representatives for inciting violence. Im guessing she wont be.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kulxor/i_wonder_if_alexandria_ocasiocortez_will_be/,Trump said he  39 s not attending the inauguration  Clearly  this is an incitement of violence and he deserves to be permanently banned.   Bunch of jackasses.  I guess the donkey symbol is pretty apt then.  Twitter has been banning people who post that screenshot. They want to memory hole it.  Didn t she ask them to do that   No idea  I just know people who  39 ve posted it on twitter and either had it deleted  or been banned.  Her handlers tried to get Twitter to make her old posts unsharable.  I m sure there are plenty of screenshots  I did my part by saving it to external storage in case it gets drastic.  Good man  What s the point of that  She could just delete them if she doesn t want them shared.  Plausible deniability. Deleting tweets makes it obvious a user is trying to hide something. Having Twitter hide the tweets could be rationalized in a number of ways as the info isn  39 t being  quot erased quot .  You thought a Democrat would be held responsible for their actions  That s so cute...  Or when Kamala posted a donations link to help bail rioters out of jail  Is that link still up   Maybe the q anon people can use it.  Lol   So  discomfort is a dog whistle for vandalism  arson  and violence  Perhaps it is time we stopped protesting in front of capitol hill and started protesting outside of these big tech companies corporate offices. Although I am against us making them feel  quot discomfort quot   I am all for us making them feel nervous by showing up in huge  peaceful numbers. I can almost guarantee that these protests will get all the media attention they deserve and on top of that it will make the local and federal governments show their asses by how quickly they deploy local law and federal resources at the problem. It will shine a spotlight on all the people who feel your right to exercise your first amendment rights should be squashed if your views do not agree with theirs.  You would think the Capitol riot was the only riot in the last 10 months given all the attention and condemnation it  39 s getting.  And that the officer that died in the Capitol riot was the only officer killed or injured in the last decade.  The death of this officer is heinous and unacceptable..    I do NOT condone the actions of the few hundred that caused all this..   Are we talking about the officer that killed himself or is this something different   No  that  39 s  D ifferent  Didn  39 t we have a thread on here already with AOC trying to get twitter to stop allowing Retweets of these tweets   Projection projection projection. That s all they got. When you re forced into a corner with evidence all you can do is accuse someone else of what you did so the attention can be diverted off of you  Hold on  are you saying  AOC is a.... Hypocrite  Whattttt    no way   Anyone with eyeballs and ears sees and hears the hypocrisy. Enjoy all the angry leftists in your DMs after posting this    First it was  quot you can  39 t be racist against white people quot   No because they don  39 t play by the same set of rules. For some reason we think calling out their hypocrisy is going to accomplish anything. We are playing by a ruleset they don  39 t and this is why we lose.

Just with all the craziness relating to the election and what not  almost every unlocked thread has been flooded with pleasant comments like that so the mods have had to lock almost everything to keep some semblance of order. It hasn  39 t worked completely because the flair system isn  39 t fool proof  but it has helped prevent total anarchy.  If I may  with this new change  how do individuals who more recently found this subreddit or lurked like myself find themselves a flair. I tried to comment earlier on the post about 1984 selling on Amazon and was recommending Fahrenheit 451  but I think it was removed since I don  39 t have a flair.  Hey  I really appreciate explaining it to me  thanks for the info  Moderators sometimes designate certain posts as  flaired only . That means members of this sub that have a track record of posting conservative posts and have asked for flair from them are allowed to post. All others have their posts removed from that thread.   Yeah  everything is flaired   I haven t been able to get flair because I can t comment or actively participate. I get the reasons behind it but man  I d like to contribute to SOME posts.   Thank goodness we can actually discuss things here on a non flaired thread. It  39 s dangerous to have a closed audience repeat back your biases.  Hi guys   Hopefully this means that the people doing the brigading are getting bored and I will finally be able to post on things again with my new account  I hate just being able to upvote against all the downvotes but I shall do my duty until I can comment properly again.  I was hoping someone would  but we all know it won t go anywhere with all of these idiot liberal judges who won t enforce our constitution.  You mean liberal activists. Not judges.   removed   You realize that facebook has special tax breaks that label is as a nonbaised platform for the public  if they want to censor a certain group they need to lose that status.  Bingo.  These are civil suits  not criminal so the constitution doesn  39 t apply.  Private companies should be accountable to their shareholders and whomever the enter into contracts with.  An argument can be made that there  39 s and implicit contract to fairly enforce terms of service.  I agree that it is not a first amendment issue  but it is censorship  and censorship is bullshit  especially the way they stuck it all the way up the president and parler  39 s asses. People getting fired for showing up to a protest  on the other hand  that HAS to be a constitutional issue. I mean shit  can a company that hates nascar fire an employee for going to a race  Or can a company that hates the Dallas Cowboys fire an employee that goes to cowboys tailgates   Read the first amendment  it s not.  Most states can fire you if they don t like who you are.  It s something conservatives fought tooth and nail for.  Called  at will employment  states.  You re mad at something conservatives have fought for over decades.  Trump just put in over 250 judges and 3 scotus. Wtf r u talking abt.   removed   The tons of activists that remain at the district and court of appeals level.  Yeah all those.   They want to silent us   Was this created by Americans   That specific sentence  most likely not  Oh finally I can speak  for some reason I can never get a flair so I  39 m stuck just lurking on this sub.  Well considering I have no record of a modmail from you requesting one that probably has something to do with it.  Probation should be longer and always under scrutiny. Rules...without them we live with the animals.   removed    removed   I might switch to Elon musks star link  and I don t like the guy  but he s not gonna allow this crap  Since banks are already thinking to ban people based on political opinions. I would say in a few weeks.  I guarantee executives from other Internet dependent companies will be reviewing the AWS risk. Amazon suddenly deciding to jettison a client so publicly is a stupid PR move.  No  they won  39 t. Most companies don  39 t have a platform which allows political exchange. Most companies stay way from politics.  I vehemently disagree with your last sentence.  and I do declare that we can agree to disagree.     Cheers  happy cake day  Parler is politics. If it were only politics I  39 d be inclined to agree with you. But once Big Tech flexes its muscles it will no longer need to be only politics.  There are different types of  quot Big Tech quot . The Social Media  quot big tech quot  and Server hosting  quot big Tech quot  are one of them. The stuff that happened on parler directly led to the storming of the capitol. All parler needs to do is to remove any message which directly incites violence on someone. Go to  a href   r ParlerWatch  r ParlerWatch  a  and see the deranged idiots who literally fantasize about killing people. Parler went full free speech absolutist. Total free speech is a double edge sword and companies can be sued if their platforms promote such activities. AWS is protecting its ass at the moment. If another violent event happens at their watch  then there will be lots of lawsuits coming for them.Server hosting big tech is dominated by AWS  almost 40  of all websites are hosted on their datacenters and more than 50  of total amazon profits comes from aws.  AWS will not give a shit until your platform is literally used to kill people. Thats their bare minimum. They have given multiple notices to Parler before to regulate content to not have any sort of threatening speech or violence. But the edge lords at Parler didnt give a shit and this happened now. They underestimated the derangement of their lunatics. It is not about politics bcos national enquirer  who tried to show dick pics of Bezos  is also hosted at AWS. The bare minimum they needed to do is to ban speech which incites violence and they didnt do it.I am part of the Tech ecosystem and it isn  39 t all black and white as all people on both sides of political spectrum think it is.  I read here on Reddit yesterday that Parler took down posts from Lin Wood. So I don t think it s really true free speech.  Should we deplatform reddit too  Got to  a href   r shitpoliticssays  r shitpoliticssays  a  to see for yourself.  Absolutely agree. Still don t understand why the fuck they removed them.  Money  it  39 s always money.  We  39 re all friends of an open market here  so I don  39 t understand the reasoning behind that when anyone can start a new business. Trump can do it if he is as rich as he said  he might have something running soon.  Hipocrisy is the problem.. they let leftist terrorists do as they please  Fact Check is now synonymous with propaganda.  I  39 m glad. He needs to get Zuccked.   I love how we have smart  persuasive and Powerful people like this on our side. I hate when we get labeled with being ignorant or stupid by the liberals.  Can we all agree that Facebook losing to Candace Owens helps everyone   Go get them Candice     Candace Owens 2024     I would 100  vote for her  She speaks the truth. Hypothetically  let s say she wins. Even though the Left should be happy with a black female president  they would still hate her because of her beliefs. More reason for her to become a candidate       Heck yeah     lol  It s a private business  they can refuse service to whoever they feel has violated their TOS. It s pretty simple.  Aahhhh remember the baker with the gay couple  Well thats not what the left said then  Colin Kaepernick tweeted and I quote  when civility leads to death   which it didn t  but that s a different matter   The cries for peace will rain down  and when they do the will fall on deaf ears  because your violence has brought this resistance   While morally disagreeable  that still doesn t mean it s illegal. Again  it s a private company  they can choose to not host right wingers just because they feel like it. Remember the wedding cakes  Same shit.  Good luck  it  39 s a private company. Maybe use the post office.  Its a civil suit. She can do what she wants and there is precedent to support us.  No one  39 s suppressing free speech here. Say anything you want to anyone who will listen. No one is being charged for saying stupid shit. Private companies just don  39 t want to broadcast your stupidity.  If that  39 s what you think then that  39 s what you think  its not like your comments gonna change anything but you do have the right to make one  Unless the mods add a flaired users only tag. Which is their right to not let me spout what I  39 m sure they think it  39 s stupidity on their sub.   What about BLM  Many people dead  lots of damage in property and so much more  I don  39 t know what you  39 ve been keeping up with but I  39 m just sharing this  not here to debate  you have the right to your own opinion and I respectfully disagree with your last statement  What was Trump suspended for  Serious question.  Originally he was suspended for posting a video saying  quot the election was stolen from me  and it  39 s outrageous but please go home now. P.S. I love you riotous bbs quot . And a tweet saying  paraphrasing   quot this is what happens when you mess with patriots quot    I just love her  Holy hell in a hand grenade  this chick talks like she  39 s trying to brainwash a classroom full of pre schoolers.  Ha ha   What was it conservatives said when those people wouldn t make the cake for gay couples  But now Twitter  AWS  Facebook  Apple etc MUST allow you to spread your lies because you like the products  LMFAO. You tough guy conservatives better learn to code      Go tell that to Candice  she  39 s the one sueing  I wasn  39 t making a statement just sharing.  Yup   just keep amplifying the nonsense because  it s just our viewpoint . The current conservative element has gotten a very twisted view on current events and has forgotten a lot of what they ve been saying the last four years. Sounds very  snowflake ish  to me... it was all valid until an attempted coup occurred. Liberals aren t typically these flag waving  patriots    but you know what   we love America. We ve spoken and used our votes... by mail and early because we take the virus seriously. Not because we think we re all going to die from it   it s to keep the healthcare system with capacity for all medical emergencies. This all stems from a lying president and his enablers amplifying information like the election was rigged   then saying  hey these people are upset because they believe the election was rigged  without owning that they are the ones who put that out there   FALSY and with bad intent.   Good for her   We need Candace right now.  Hell yes.  Maybe she can find a few more media companies to sue  I would love for her to be the first black female billionaire president.  Candace Owens is my hero  Psssst....the crooked Leftist judges are in on this.  Did you mean the leftist judges trump appointed  Or the ones bush appointed  Or the ones Obama had blocked  I  39 ve been a proponent of free speech for as long as I can remember  but I never thought I would see this level of censorship in my own lifetime. It is utterly disgusting. And the concerted hit job on the president  his twitter fb ig  plus his shopify store and his email  and they shit they did to parler is only the beginning. Maybe it  39 s time to start writing pamphlets and using mail  I don  39 t know  but I am pissed and disillusioned all at once.  Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences. If you spew hateful and ignorant garbage and incessantly spread lies and disharmony  people don t have to give you a platform or keep you around. No one is entitled to force others to listen to their opinions. You have free speech  but there are consequences that everyone needs to accept.   This comment has been flagged for disinformation pertaining to free speech   You  39 re the one who doesn  39 t understand free speech. All free speech does is guarantee you immunity from legal prosecution from voicing your opinion. It doesn  39 t  em entitle you  em  to the ability or right to voice your opinion on any platform. It just protects your right to do so if and when you do.  Then repeal section 230 protection. If Twitter wants to play thought gods then they shouldn t be protected as some sort of neutral platform. If they are deciding actively what is posted and what isn t then they should be held accountable as any other publisher would.   This comment has been flagged for disinformation pertaining to free speech    quot Flaired users only quot  is a tag on 99  of posts on this sub  it  39 s pretty clear you guys don  39 t believe all free speech suppression is a bad thing lol  Take that up with the mods  I m not a mod.   I understand  and I m not totally arguing with you on that. I m however not a mod and not in a position to argue why that rule exists tbf  I  39 ll help you out. It  39 s because they are suppressing opposing voices. Hypocritical  If someone wants to come here and get informed or enter civil discourse  that s totally fine and should be allowed. I think what the mods are doing is to prevent the irrational idiots coming in here telling people that they should be dead or should have been aborted  like some of the messages I received in my inbox  You have no constitutional rights to shitpost on social media. That you THINK you do says a lot about your whole god damn bowel movement of a  party.  Free speech means freedom of expression  you pube. Tweeting or posting on IG   freedom of expression   free speech. How many times have you failed grade 2   You have no fucking idea what the constitution says. Its hilarious.  When you sign up for a Twitter FB Instagram account  you check yes on the Terms of Service that say they own your account and can do anything they want with it  including suspend it. The first amendment only protects your speech from the government  private platforms like Twitter or Google have the explicit legal right to deplatform anyone they want. Maybe Republicans shouldn  39 t have spent the last 40 years deregulating big business and screeching  quot but muh free market capitalism quot .  This for sure. If someone says something I don  39 t like  it  39 s my choice whether or not to get offended or worked up. It  39 s not up to me or anyone else in general to determine consequences for society.  Why do you on this sub shriek endlessly about freedom of speech while also only allowing  quot authorized users quot  to post and having mods ban anyone who speaks out against Dear Leader   What is the right consequence then   And you have no right to speak on a site like Facebook.  It s a privilege.  I suppose what I meant was  no one is entitled to force anyone to broadcast their opinions   better  Do you disagree   Yes. Yes I do.  You re totally ignoring that it s the result of the speech that is an issue   i.e violence  hate  and insurrection based on lies  not that people don t like it. No one should be forced to host those messages and those messages should be quashed because they result in unjust and harmful outcomes.  There is a big difference from just sayin shitty things and some people taking those words to do  quot violence  hate and insurrection quot  and inciting  quot violence  hate and insurrection quot .  In criminal law   strong incitement  strong  is the encouragement of another person to commit a crime.  Let the audiences users decide all of that. Are you disabled  you need social media sensors everything for you just bc you don t like it.  Uh it s not about not liking anything. I d hope most people wouldn t like someone spreading lies and misinformation and inciting violence. What I don t support is state actors hijacking private entities into their own propaganda networks and abusing both the platform and the public s trust.  Consequences should be for individuals with actual hate speech. You don t delete entire accounts and platforms because you don t like their view. And if we are deleting entire platforms for hate speech  Twitter and Facebook both need to be deleted for all of the hate speech flying around those platforms.  What is  quot hate speech  quot    a href  https   www.youtube.com watch v OhqB wjOI5M  Here  a  is real hate speech and AFAIK  that guy who told CNN they were gonna  quot Burn this bitch down quot  in Minneapolis hasn  39 t been brought up on any charges for inciting violence.  Maxine Waters saying  quot get in their faces  quot   ... and did Representative Waters face any consequences   No but she should have.  Agreed   Consequences should apply to any action that requires them. Hate speech is one example. Incitement of violence and insurrection is another. And that includes spreading lies about the legitimacy of our democratic process.  Like the Russian collusion BS.  Liberal judges refuse to hear the cases  that doesn  39 t mean it was a lie. That  39 s why we are angry.  I m a lawyer man  I followed the cases. I read the judges  opinions. I ve also written opinions for both state and federal judges so I know how it works. If the lawyers had the evidence the claimed to have they would have at least been able to proceed on a handful of their cases. Instead  the lawyers literally didn t even argue fraud and flat out said they had no evidence of fraud to present. Instead  they wanted to use technicalities to disenfranchise millions of voters like in PA. It was a ruse. You re parroting Trump talking points and I d wager you never even actually read the filings or the opinions.  Pennsylvania changed their voting laws without a vote.  That directly goes against pennsylvania  39 s constitution. It doesn  39 t get anymore clear than that man.  Apparently the courts and the PA government disagree. And apparently the Republican Pennsylvania legislature that changed the law didn t have a problem with it until their candidate lost. Even assuming that what you re saying is correct and true  which is disputed and most likely false   why should a court throw out millions of legitimate votes on a technicality  Isn t there a constitutional interest in not disenfranchising millions of legitimate votes   I  39 d venture to say this person wouldn  39 t even no what a filing or opinion is at it relates to the courts.  This is the left s favorite talking point now. They will come for your speech too  just wait. Will you chalk it up to consequences then   They don t even realize their confirmation bias. They agree with the agenda  so therefore there is no agenda. Until it happens to them...  It s not just the left man. I m an attorney  I have studied constitutional law. I do worry that the left will seize this weak point for conservatives and especially Trump and try to twist the knife and ban many actors. But I absolutely do not support Trump or Trumpism.   Facebook is a Bakery. Donald Trump is a gay wedding. Is that easier   Mmhm  sure  except that the gay wedding went to a different store that allows it but the first bakery and other bakery  39 s ganged up on the one bakery that allowed it and shut it down because it  39 s not like their bakery  39 s. Is that easier   The artisan bakery  39 s source of flour and yeast both refused to do further business with them  but they also sell cakes and breads directly to the consumers  in a bigger operation   She  39 s kinda a hack conman compared to Trump. Yet hey  if you  39 re dumb enough to give her   then have at it I guess.  America is full of suckers these days. So she preys on that for a living.   Did some researching on that site.  It s owned by Airwaves media which in turn is owned by Interflow group which is owned by Taher Khan.  He is a prominent figure in the Pakistani government which is extremely friendly with China.  In all honesty you probably just ran into what she described in her video.  False narratives and  fact checks  that are influenced greatly by the Chinese government.  Candace Owen  39 s is amazing  strong and brave  I appreciate her not backing down  She needs to go for the throat.  I would 100  vote for her for President.  How the hell can a company that actively and openly censors users for their own political benefits be considered a platform    I really hope she runs for President  one day  She s a legend   This post has been flagged for being incredibly based   Mods have a stickie at the top.  Outlined it.  They are kinda being harsh about it right now as we  39 ve been getting the brigade daily.  It was a lot more open before the election.  I  39 m slightly concerned with the barrier to entry for the conservative subreddit.  Can anyone genuinely explain it   Anyone have any idea on how successful she might be in this venture   She should have done this without asking for money. As things goes further she could ask for donations.  Christ  she is a complete airhead.
t3_kv21bq,Prosecutors weigh heavy hammer  felony murder  for rioters in Capitol officers death,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv21bq/prosecutors_weigh_heavy_hammer_felony_murder_for/,How about the people who killed people during the riots   Don  39 t you dare frighten politicians.. or sorry  Democrats. If this was a left wing protest and they were breaking windows in an attempt to intimidate Mitch MConnel the left would be celebrating them and the rioters would be slapped with trespassing and vandalism charges and even then they would be released with time served. That  39 s assuming any charges would be filed at all. Because resisting Republicans means resisting fascism.  Say her name.  Let s just amp up the tensions in America. Soon we will all forget how to spell much less say  unity .  They  39 ve been very vague about what happened to this officer   there  39 s still no direct cause of death attributed as far as I can tell. And that  39 s deliberate I think. If he was assaulted  then those responsible need to pay and depending on the nature of the assault I can  em maybe  em  see a murder charge sticking.   If he died due to rioters we would know. That would have been blasted everywhere. The fact that its being blasted in this  quot died  who knows why quot  context should tell you everything you need to know.  Threaten everyone  and their children  with sky high charges so they plea.  Exactly.  And most of them will not have the money to put forward an adequate legal defense.

What are we going to do about it   Don  39 t worry  they will have a list of every person who voted for Trump from voter rolls and start rounding us up  putting us in re education camps.   It ll just be a war of attrition on the constitution. Nothing is more disappointing than knowing your country was the worlds greatest then fell   not from external forces  but to internal globalists selling themselves to the external forces.   Oh yeah  it will absolutely be death camps.  Nazi did it and the CCP is doing it already...  I was only half serious but a few months ago I said it won  39 t be long until we can  39 t criticize Joe Biden  a sitting president  online without being censored. But now I am thinking that will actually become a reality.  The people of power cracking down on the opposition.  This is the night of broken glass Arnold.  Jan 7th.  When the socialist tech giants silenced their competitors  Fine impeach for this  with that bar set so low I want the GOP to remove the democrats that support violent riots
t3_kulwxj,Free Speech Platform Gab Reports 753 Percent Increase in Traffic in 24 Hours,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kulwxj/free_speech_platform_gab_reports_753_percent/,Explains why it  39 s been so slow for me...  I can t even access it right now.  You can say that with parler as well. Time for these two companies to get big boy servers  Well parlor is just fucked... so gab will sky rocket  Parler and Gab should merge.  They  39 re fighting the same fight.  It says  quot under maintenance quot  now  The left will never allow a communication platform to exist if they cannot directly control the flow of information  Don t worry big tech will take it down soon  They already tried due the the heavy white supremacy presence on the platform.  That is why gab is hosted with undisclosed company in some foreign dont give a crap country.  Well let  39 s invite the black supremacists  and the whatever the fuck else supremacists on too. They have just as much of a right to free speech too.  Firmly agree. Free speech is free speech. I don t care who says what to whom  I ll defend their right.  This didn  39 t use to be controversial.  Sad times.  Blackpeopletwitter would have a field day I am sure.  Let them. As long as its all kept legal.  Honestly I would pop some corn to watch the show.  Really  I ve honestly never heard of it till just now  I better get it before Apple takes it off the App Store  It  39 s all website or side load on Android.  They got pulled from the app stores a few years ago.  They could still go after their dns hosting  even sinkholing it at the root level.  There is still plenty of bullshit they could pull.  Then you go to an ip system websites work without dns  Without DNS you lose a ton of less savvy people  I  39 m not talking about normies I am talking about people willing to dodge cancel culture.  People will do anything if it involves their livelihood. I learned these simple skills by bypassing my middle schools ban for certain websites. I for one don t mind a little tweaking to access anything.  Haha yeah I remember being 13 and using proxy browsers to get onto Facebook on the school network  Wasn t it the greatest of times lol      Nor me  Sure but making that work for most people isn t feasible.  Along with that ISPs could start dropping packets to those IPs.  I guess you could vpn or use tor but again  that s not feasible for most users.  These days most websites seem to either outright refuse Tor connection or are maddeningly slow  Their CDN is Cloudfare  they may take it down  Sadly they  39 re just making themselves a target. They  39 re only going after Parler because it has a chance of being the Twitter alternative. They don  39 t want that.  Gab was the original  and Parler happened in response to Gab being kicked off of stores and hosts..  Yep and since they know AWS has it they will pressure it.  Making them the next target of the Left.  Free speech     Someone call the ccp and big tech immediately  Just tried to make an account and it s under maintenance. Lol. They probably weren t expecting this.  I managed to get on this afternoon     All I have to say is buy some puts in twitter Monday morning. That stock is gonna be toxic.  How much of their traffic the last 5 ish years was connected to Trump in some way  They killed their own Golden goose to virtue signal  After the Constitutional Restoration and destruction of the left  there will be a Trust Busted  set of companies maintained to help stabilize the addicted  for a generation until they can be weaned off that mindrot.  Gab.com is awesome   Slow right now but i was patient and got signed up. Great UI. Deleted all big tech b.s and sold all stock in them. Vote with your wallet friends.  They need to work on their layout  once they get the servers handled  cause that shit sucks.  It takes time to work out the bugs   thosen others have been at it for decades now    but shallower learnbing curve  utilizing that development  Yah  I get that. I was just saying it sucks.  yes it will and people best be making themselves ready for it

t3_kuoiks,Feds looking at declaring Proud Boys a terrorist organization in wake of U.S. rioting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuoiks/feds_looking_at_declaring_proud_boys_a_terrorist/,Proud boys are an idea  Haha.  But they won t classify Antifa as terrorists   FBI director says antifa is an ideology  not an organization  The FBI should be defunded  Along with a lot of other alphabet agencies.  That  39 s retarded  ANTIFA has an ideology  most organizations do  its an organization pushing an ideology  a Leftist  Progressive  Marxist  Social Liberal  Social Democratic ideology.  A week later he clarified and expanded on his earlier comments.  You can t classify an idea as a terrorist  Yet they ve had the most tangible impact with respect to violence and rioting.  I know lol I m just mocking biden  Biden is a terrorist.  Yes he absolutely is   I know     I  39 ll settle for BLM  the organization  BLM and antifa burning  looting  and destroying cities is fine.  According to that dip shit  Beau Of The Fifth Column. BLM and Antifa were justified in what they did because they were fighting against systemic racism. Everyone at the Capitol were simply doing it because they didn  39 t like the results of the election.  So imaginary systemic racism  gt  actual systemic corruption    Sure...  ok.  Look him up on YouTube and try to watch some of his video  39 s. I challenge you to not lose your shit within the first 30 seconds of his pseudo intellectual diatribe that boils down to nothing more than  quot Orange Man Bad quot . The mere fact that he has over 500K subscribers is truly a testament to how utterly stupid some people actually are.  Canadian Feds  What are they gonna do  refuse to say  quot sorry quot  to us   Might be the only terrorist group ever whose foundation is the idea that people should be proud of their country and should all be afforded unconditional freedoms.   Dude I m pretty sure every terrorist organization is centered around being proud of your country. That is literally the premise of groups like the IRA  So the key is to hate your country to not be classified as a terrorist    Were the revolutionaries were considered terrorists in 1776   By this metric  yes.  But the Proud Boys are white supremacists   He  39 s blacker than Talcum X  that  39 s for sure   Certainly backer than Harris tbh.  Soros didn  39 t like pride in ones country.. yah know because he helped the Nazis.. just as he is now...  This sub has become  a href   r politics  r politics  a . It s sad to see.  If Proud Boys is declared one   BLM must be declared one too.  BLM has done more damage  death  and crime than all.  How many innocent people have they killed   I thought le average redditor said you can  39 t designate domestic organizations as terrorist in response to Trump and Antifa.  If the left didn t have double standards  they would have no standards at all. Think Shapiro said that one.  Canadian Feds... if you  39 re talking about a US group at a US capital  and you just say   39 feds  39   you are misleading.  That doesn  39 t make any sense because the Proud Boys weren  39 t responsible for the rioting in DC.  I am okay with punishing the people responsible but punishing people who weren  39 t is both dishonest and politically dangerous.  We don t punish by group  legally. Individuals commit crimes.  This is a confusing response.  Targeting a group not responsible for the rioting makes sense to you   I m pointing out that if we start calling each other terrorists  the government party in power gets to decide who it is  and it won t be fair.  This is another confusing response.  If the government is pretending a group who aren  39 t terrorists are terrorists and using partisan differences as a reason to infringe on their rights that  39 s highly illegal and dangerous.  Whoosh  Then it went over your head.  It seems to me like you don  39 t think there is a difference in the government appropriately treating a group of terrorists as terrorists and the government inappropriately labeling a group that the political party in power dislikes as terrorists in bad faith.  I can  39 t disagree with your posts more if that  39 s what you  39 re trying to say.  This already happened. Two ranchers charged under terrorism statutes under the Obama DOJ  which led to a standoff. Remember   Okay  no wonder your responses were throwing me off you were thinking of these situations and not the one that was the catalyst to the one this article is talking about.     removed   There was a BLM activist guy  goes by John Sullivan.  He  39 s the one guy in the building itself I heard got released.  Don  39 t know if he damaged anything  but they went hard after the dude who just took a selfie and left a note on Pelosi  39 s desk.   removed   Why not just stop with all the foreplay and declare any individual or group that does not kiss the Democrat ring as terrorists    um  what  were they even at the capitol on Wednesday  I don  39 t understand... this is just a witch hunt of all groups to the right of ANTIFA at this point.  And they will get it done too  because the Left is more competent and ballsy than Trump  Antifa is going to be teaching your kindergarteners transgender issues at this rate.  Just remember.  Our founding fathers were considered terrorists to the powers that be of their time.   But they weren  39 t there.   I m ready to wear my maga badge so I can be identified by my elites as a subhuman  racist   s  The British would have considered the colonists terrorists when they dumped the tea as well  There no coming back from this leftist insanity.  Divorce or war appear to be the only viable options.  Let s just agree to disagree and part ways.  Do I really care about a cult that tries to control the sexual habits of its members   big yawn  Declaring a group  quot domestic terrorists quot  for purely partisan reasons  setting the precedent for all future administrations going forward to weaponize the Department of Justice against their political opponents...that gets a yawn from you   Proud Boys is an idea  not an organization  That  39 s funny and all  but I don  39 t think people appreciate how terrible an idea this is.  who  39 s laughing

Rid yourself. I thought the Democrat party hated spoiled rich white people who haven  39 t done a day of real work in their lives  No   I understand that but if you ask them  the rich should be eaten  pay their fair share and all that. Their words and actions don  39 t align.  That was a base of theirs for years. We are for the working people. Not anymore  but  that is what they campaigned on for years and years  You hit it spot on  For the last time  we do not care what Monica Lewinsky  39 s boyfriend  39 s wife has to say.  You are white. Let  39 s start with you.  Nice projection there  she  39 s the face of white supremacy...  How the hell doesn t voting for a certain person based on my political beliefs make me a white supremacist  biden literally coauthored a bill based around segregation and I m a white supremacist for voting against that lunatic   In college it was explained that being white  or even light skinned hispanic  middle eastern  etc  means you are a white supremacist.  Trash like that helps keep racism alive  I think that  39 s the point. What would they have to rally around if it ever truly left   How did the explain how other races stay roughly the same color too lol  Nothing to do with locality or genetic differences  Just inbreeding lol   When were you in college  if don  39 t mine me asking   That just shows their ignorance. I ve had my dna analyzed and you can see my genetic makeup is primarily from countries that are geographically close to each other  which makes perfect sense when you realize that travel wasn t always as east at it is today  Is this legitimately something you learned in a class  I mean  that genuinely doesn t surprise me even a little bit  just curious if this is actually the rhetoric on college campuses  It s leftist think. If you can t make sense of it  you re in good psychological shape.  What I really  really would like to know is...what is it going to take to rid us of the Clinton s   How does impeachment even equate to a hit on white supremacy  There  39 s no logical connection. Sounds like she really should be prescribed some better meds to counter the crazy.  It should also be noted that everyone keeps saying this impeachment is about insurrection yet she  39 s saying it  39 s about white supremacy. Usually they have their story straight and they all get the talking points. Maybe she got an old set of talking points.  Of course not.  We need to go further.  Start imprisoning for speech crimes.  Make white people more of the enemy.  She finally turning herself in for being too white   She doesn  39 t want to get rid of white supremacy  just Conservatives in general.  News flash Hilliot  Conservatives are all races.  Still a sore loser after 4 years. Locking you up in prison isn t enough for committing fraud on a fisa court. You instigated a fake Russian hoax and lied to the American people. Where is your 33 000 deleted emails   Lol can we get a bot that pulls up the Killary Klinton Kill List on demand   Bitch  you re white   She pushed for Biden and adored Robert Byrd  soooooo.....

t3_kv5k2c,Biden inauguration to unfurl under America United theme,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kv5k2c/biden_inauguration_to_unfurl_under_america_united/, America United...but first after conservatives undergo liberal conversion therapy.   This fucking guy...lol  Unprecedented levels of  gaslighting.  Hahahaha in your dreams    quot America United quot    Half of America United    Here. I fixed it.  If the left wants us to unite  perhaps they should start without taking away our free speech across the country... Unite... what a joke  Also known as the  quot shut up and do what you  39 re told you disgusting prole quot  meme. There will be zero tolerance for non compliance. If you do  you  39 re an insurrectionist and a domestic terrorist. In fact  since silence is violence  failure to openly support Biden will result in your being designated a domestic terrorist.  Most Soviet Block puppet states were lead by one or another   39 United  39  party. USSR was a Union as well. When part of your party and supporters say about banning opposition or even participates in it and another talks about unification it is hard not to compare it to these times and organizations.  A fine example of the meaning of IRONY   Consider just some of the  strong  em very latest  em   strong  things Biden has said  forget about his comments going back 45 years. This is the unity president  We have a senile octogenarian sticking up for Black Lives Matter and criticizing Caucasians. Who on earth is  blackmailing this guy and what do they have on him.  The left is okay with big tech silencing republican voices and Biden thinks he s a uniter       Bwahahaha haha what an absolutely joke  Nothing like getting your leg pissed on and being told   Hey look  it s raining    I love how they are still trying to call us Nazis  Unity  because it works in North Korea   That  39 s spit take worthy. This guy is incapable of unifying his thoughts  let alone the country.  This is so fucking simple. Call out the capital rioters by name  call out antifa by name  then say that 99  of Americans hate BOTH of their fucking guts and that the radical nuts on both sides are anti american and can suck our balls.   I ll take your word for it. Won t be watching
t3_kuewa3,Report Pence Will Attend Inauguration,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuewa3/report_pence_will_attend_inauguration/,Lots of weird responses here. It is correct he attends. Biden is going to be the new president  like it or not. He was legally confirmed by congress so Pence is doing the right thing by respecting that. He is being a professional. Refusing to attend won  39 t solve anything.  The weird responses are part of the reason some of the center left has an issue with the right. There is such an ingrained notion of   39 all or nothing  39  when it comes to party loyalty and going with what your rep vp president says.  The party and Trump loyalty is absolutely disgusting. I  39 m a conservative  not a Republican.  He got.my vote... not my all.consuming fealty.  And the irony is that all the Trumpers are calling everyone who sticks with the constitution conservative values traitors.   The Left is actually very much the same in that regard. There s purity tests everywhere. It s so stupid  you shouldn t agree on every policy with practically anyone. It s inorganic and poisonous.  Yup  completely agree. That  39 s why I think the two party tribal system we have in place is stupid.  It is  but it massively benefits the elite class.  I  39 m not a conservative. I lean to the democratic side. I cannot express how important it is for us to remain logical like you are here. I don  39 t hate Republicans. I hate extremists  on either side.  Correct take. I m not looking forward to some of Biden s policies but it s time to move on. Biden is the next presidents and we should show him the courtesy and respect that befits the inauguration. Before anyone says  but Dems didn t     yes  and I criticized that and find it to be negative behavior.   God it s so refreshing seeing sane responses to this compared to what you see on thedonald  I feel kinda bad for the guy at this point. Trump put him in a really tough spot by challenging his loyalty at the 11th hour. Questions about the integrity of the election aside  he did the right thing then and he  39 s doing the right thing now.  Trump completely threw him under the bus by putting him in a no win situation. Our Republic seems sick and dying  and asking Pence to go against 200  years of custom to make a move of questionable constitutionality would have only damaged it further. There were bigger issues than a single president.  I agree. Even as a Trump fan who voted for him in 2016  2020 and would vote for him again   I can  39 t say I  39 m pleased with his decisions in his last few weeks in office  and I can only imagine they were made because of his inability to accept defeat.  What the hell happened to this sub  Used to have pretty reasonable discussion  now it  39 s whiney Trumpists sad that they lost their election. Hopefully all these Trump worshippers go away after he gets the boot.  r T D got shutdown and they came here it s not that hard.  It  39 s sad. I wish they would follow up and all go to Parler lmao.  Guys I don t think that he s wrong here. Pence is a consummate politician  and he s also a really classy guy. He wasn t attacked with the same level of vitriol Trump was  he got the slightly upgraded call all conservatives are bigots  Democrat line. It makes sense for him to attend. Personally I don t think Trump should  but I think it s good that there s someone from the administration who is. Pence isnt a traitor. He didn t have the power to turn away the electors. Trump was wrong to tweet about pence the way he did  the guy has been incredibly loyal to the President  Pence is taking into account what if he wants to run for president in the future as well.  I think as a person  Pence would be a good president  I don t think pence would be electable. He comes off as such an earnest nice intelligent guy  and although I don t think he would be ruffled at all by hysterical Democrats  see the VP debate   his personality doesn t appear to have the strength To be heard over the mob.  The time of Pence s type being President has come and gone I think. I think he would make a great conservative President  and I would vote for him  but I don t think he d fit in today s political climate. Maybe he ll prove me wrong  No  I totally agree with you. 10 years ago  he would ve been great  but you re right  the temperature is too high for such a calm dude  He was the perfect offset from Trump  and added calmness to the administration. Hopefully he finds somewhere to make an impact on the future  Oh  I was drinking during that debate  and it was epic. He wiped the floor with her. Pence was the perfect choice  and my only wish is that he would have been more prominent in the last four years. Like  what is Pence had had a Twitter that repeat it trumps words in a more palatable way  What is Pence gave more political speeches and was out in public talking. What if they tagteam to the social media  so that the important things that needed to be bombastic came from Trump  and the important things that need to actually be understood by the American people came from Pence  I wonder if there would have been any difference. I think that the moderate contingency that couldn t hold her nose and vote Trump might have been swayed if Pence has been used more often and affectively  I agree  although I haven t seen much of Pence  I think he would ve helped balance out Trump s fierceness  and they would ve been a great team.  I think he  39 d be great  but what it ultimately boils down to is that Democrats and the media are obsessed with hating on white religious people.  There is no world  not right now  where a white religious conservative doesn  39 t immediately get tagged as anti women and anti minority.  Facts and their record don  39 t matter.  They will run headline after headline of opinion pieces trotted out like objective journalism saying how bad they are and the average moderate voter will only hear that.  Only conservatives hear conservative media and even moderate conservatives don  39 t consume it regularly.  This last election proved it  the only way conservatives can win is if we attract moderates from both sides of the isle with good policy.  White college educated men voted for Biden because they were convinced to some level that he was a white supremacist.  They will trot this out on every white candidate.  Hell  they tried to jump that shark with ACB and she has two adopted children that aren  39 t white.  Agreed. He would make a good president but he would suck at running for president.  He  39 s the perfect VP if you think about it.  It s a damn shame too   he showed in the veep debate that he was by far the most qualified  intelligent  and in touch person for the presidency out of the 4  Like Ross perot  He looks like he can melt in with America s working class... not.  Absolutely non electable.  He sure wouldn  39 t get my vote anymore  I personally think he s very electable and I would love to seek him debate at the presidential level.  He comes off weak to the coastal right. Maybe could get support from middle America though because he does come off as nice but not someone who you want fighting for you  I agree. It will be hard for him to run as it seems like he has mixed feelings from republicans after last week  With the split the republican party has  I don  39 t think he would be elected. He  39 d be the best candidate but you got the radical right that don  39 t want him.  I think he has some questions to answer about this whole time period and what he really believes.  An accounting.  I don  39 t think it has to be a trial of any sorts... i  39 m of the  quot agree with trump but hate his tact with the burning of 1000 suns quot  but I have questions about Pence and where he actually stood on things and why.  TBF we don  39 t usually ask much about the VP  39 s beliefs so this is pretty common. I  39 m not a fan of how he handled handled some things in Indiana  but I  39 m sure there  39 s more to him. Unfortunately  I don  39 t know how he can escape from the Trump affiliation at this point.   deleted   I think if I was him I d ride into the sunset.  Pence is in a no win situation. Either he doesn t attend and gets scorched in the media as  no better than Trump   or he attends and has to sit there quietly while Biden shits all over him and Trumps legacy the entire time while simultaneously calling for  unity  conveniently forgetting to acknowledge his parties antics over the past 4 years.  As gracious as England and the rest of the world acknowledge Argentina s right to raise the trophy after the World Cup win 1986 after the hand of God goal.  Well said. If the conservatives ever want to have a voice in government  we have to become smarter at playing the game. Right now the Democrats are successfully dividing us. This is the time to unite and fight back  not physically fight . While some Republicans are betraying us  we should try to primary them out of office  not destroy the party because we don t like them.  This is my biggest fear and I couldn t believe the division even on this sub in the last week. A lot of people saying they will never vote for a Republican ever again  which doesn t exactly help keep socialism and leftist policies at bay.  It is more than a little disconcerting to see so many responses that Pence is somehow a traitor for doing his job  more so from so called conservatives.  Trump should suck it up and attend but if he won  39 t Pence should take it up.  Has the media been unfair to Trump in the four years   Absolutely.  However that doesn  39 t excuse what happened in the capitol or Trump  39 s behavior since the election.  My mother was always fond of a saying  quot if we don  39 t behave any better we aren  39 t better. quot   If we give up on that  we  39 re just reduced to power politics and the Republic will not survive.  pence is probably the only person tied to trump thats going to come out of this whole thing better than when he went in. he seems pretty solid imo  Hopefully.  I have a feeling Trump is going to declare him the enemy and ask what strong supporters he has left to not support him in anything he might do  Pence is a man of dignity I would like to see carry the mantle... depends on where the Republicans go in the post Trump era  Trump attending probably does a bit more harm than good  although I really do think he should respect that Biden has been elected president in one way or another. I doubt he s going to change his tune  unfortunately.   Similarly to Ben Carson  Pence would be a good conservative president  imo.  I was on a media blackout this week due to really heavy personal stuff.  You picked a crazy week to tune out. I  39 m typing on a phone  so I  39 ll try to give you the short end of it.  Excellent  I  39 m actually happy that he will.  I think that would be the right move. Civility  gracious behavior cannot be overstated.  I support Trump as much as anyone but it was unreasonable to expect Pence to be   39 the hero to save the second term of the Trump Presidency  39 ...he  39 s just a tool placed in to ensure the RNC  39 s interests were maintained in the Trump administration.   Isn  39 t the inauguration going to be virtual   Its over guys.  The left is in charge.

She is desperately trying to manufacture a post Senate career in the MSM as a female version of Joe Scarborough.  Murkowski will definitely be changing parties soon.  I guess Lisa is going through an existential crisis...she doesn t even know if she s Republican anymore... s  Murkowski was never a Republican.  Nor has she ever won a legitimate election.

Both Pence and Trump s cabinet have stated numerous times that they won t invoke the 25th. The only way for Trump to be removed from office is through impeachment and then removal by congress...which takes far too long to actually happen.  Dude has 8 legitimate days left... Not a conspiracy guy  but this just screams there  39 s more going on than we  39 re aware of  i just think it s theatre. they want to discredit him and ensure he can t run in 2024.

But  let  39 s be real  at this point I  39 m really not sure he  39 s got a snowballs chance in hell is he tried... Regardless of another impeachment.  You  39 re only stoking the flames at this point.  they just want to absolutely destroy everything associated with Trump. Impeaching him isn  39 t about removing him now  but making sure he can  39 t even begin to think about running for office again in 2024. ITs a waste of time and effort  but thats what the dems do best.  laptop  DNI report  Durham report  Assange  Thus the need for diapers these days  right   I think that they actually fear Trump for what he stands for  the conservatives bully pulpit. Why would they be trying to such great lengths to discredit him if he was a failed president.  Thats how history will be written whether they impeach again or not

Sounds a lot like what I would expect to see come out of my  quot family quot  if I were to ever run for any public office after our history. Blood kin can be especially devious when they are selfish pricks and don  39 t get  or stop getting  what they want from you.  Yep sounds like crazy id expect from my sister and cousins
t3_kuifdg,Nikki Haley says Twitters ban of Trump is what happens in China,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuifdg/nikki_haley_says_twitters_ban_of_trump_is_what/,Okay then  DO SOMETHING   It  39 s long past time for reform.  Or just enforcement.  The current 230 says these companies are protected so long as they act as a platform.  They aren  39 t  so they don  39 t have the protections...it seems simple to me.  I dunno  but I do see actually applying the laws and regulations evenly as a reform at the moment. Seems like some animals are more equal than others.  Haha   You  39 re completely right.  Laws evenly enforced would be such a refreshing change right now.  GOP never does anything  just complain for campaign donations  She can t do anything.  She literally doesn  39 t hold any political power besides talking.  I mean  that  39 s all politicians  really...  I agree that legislatures are effectively in that arena. But they can at least submit legislation and hold hearings.  We believe in all free speech.  jUsT nOt YoUrS.   Stop directing your 401k to find these tech companies  Ding ding   It s also what happens in an America run by Democrats.  Yep. China of the West.  Yup  Weibo.  Wechat.  Anti government. Text photos would never reach your friends.  If it did it would magically disappear.  JUST LIKE PEOPLE  Well the people building the systems have a lot experience building them for China. They just control these ones themselves.  What can we do to take our sovereignty back   Take your labor and your money to things you do support and believe in.  Haley for President 2024  First Indian president. Since these days  Kamala apparently doesn  39 t care about being called Indian anymore. She has decided she  39 s black for now.

t3_kutgac,Congressman If the Capitol Officer Hadnt Fired His Shot Rioters Wouldve Hanged Black People,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kutgac/congressman_if_the_capitol_officer_hadnt_fired/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  rel  nofollow  https   discord.gg conservative  a   Where the fuck did they even come up with that   Its easy when you just outright ban anyone with a different thought or who critically thinks.  The royalty  congress  will just say shit and it s the job of the courtiers  judges  police  bureaucrats  big tech  to propagate that shit to the peasants. We are back in medieval times. It s 1021 AD with information technology.  You can literally make up anything you want in an alternate timeline.  Liberals do that. So many of them have mental illnesses so its not that hard to see why they come up with crazy scenarios in their heads.  He has mental health issues  that  39 s where it came from.  Democrats are all about proving the negative.  Wut   From what I ve seen the last 48 hours  the Democrats are reframing this as a neonazi coup.  Lmfao... what  Everytime you think it can  39 t get any more asinine  they prove you wrong.  We live in an absolute clown world  Democrats... Always having to make everything about race.  So leftists are cool with cops shooting unarmed civilians now   As long as its us...  That s quite the extrapolation  It  39 s in keeping with Biden  39 s  quot uniting quot  message  75 million black  white  Hispanic and Asian Americans are all white supremacists  Nazis and closet Klan members. Turn your back for an instant and they  39 ll lynch someone.  My wife  happens to be black  she  39 s a well known white supremacist.  If nobody wants to bother reading the article  this statement is from the Congressman who feared that Guam would capsize and worries over a world without balloons.  We are being governed by all sorts that you would expect to see in a cartoon insane asylum.    Guam capsizing. Thats awsome. Keep electing that guy for sure.  Jesus Christ  I know leftists are idiots but how can they believe this retarded nonsense   Republicans bad....Democrats good  JFC just when I thought they couldn  39 t say any dumber shit and of course it is the Guam guy.   if an innocent woman hadn t been slaughtered in cold blood with a bullet through the heart  then there would be more imaginary lynchings like jussie smollett and bubba wallace   BTW that Root Insurance commercial with Bubba Wallace is obscene. An FBI investigation of a garage door pull  smearing NASCAR fans everywhere as racists but Trump is an ogre. Screw Root Insurance and Bubba Wallace.  Not sure how you get to this from looking at pictures of some dude sitting at a desk or another guy stealing a podium.  It was the look in their eye.. You could just tell he was like  quot id sure like to lynch a minority  but i guess this podium will do for now... FOR NOW quot   Oh for fucks sake  someone find a picture of a black protestor in the capital already.  There were many. Including that BLM guy. He walked in a huge crowd of trump supporters and was never accosted in anyway. But we  39 re all savage Nazis just salivating at the thought of harming minorities.  The thought of harming minorities really hit home.  Makes me think of politicians salivating at the thought of oppressing the masses.  No fucking way. Wouldn t have happened  A congressman actually said this ... Jesus fuck  The shit that is just being made up and reported as news in the last week would make Goebbels pop like a water balloon.   Of course it  39 s Hank Johnson  who has repeatedly proven himself to be one of the dumbest people in America  look up the videos of his gaffes  this is the same man who worried Guam would tip over and sink   who makes this claim.  So I had someone do this on my Facebook.  They had a picture of a lynched black guy   then the noose someone made  which I  39 m not sure about   was that symbolically for pence   And then the dreaded confederate flag.   This is not about race. Why do the propaganda channels demand race becomes the issue  It  39 s almost like they want people divided by race so we are easier to conquer.   Democrats lack imagination. They are still trying to blame everything on racism.  Wow this has got to be the ugliest propaganda seen so far. And these evil bastards are running our country  Bee article  WTF.  Get ready... we are stuck with this till the Democrat voter is tired of the bullshit.  No I saw the noose hanging from bubba  39 s garage door. It  39 s true they were there to hang  quot B quot  lack people   Lmao. It s driving them crazy that Trump supporters didn t completely destroy the capitol  like they probably wanted us to. They wanted us to burn the fucking building down.   This is the mouth breather who thought Guam would tip over.  This is the most ridiculous  unfounded claim I ve seen to date.  What in the hell    They will lie any lie....knowing that so many of their base will believe it.  One of the key points of fascism. Put race above the individual  just more of the same from the left that are so quick to project what they are onto others  That s quite a leap   when you watch too many movies and MSM  I was looking for the satire flair  These nazis have no shame in their lies and propaganda.  If officers didnt fight them  BLM ists would have hanged white people  This makes Alex Jones look sane.  ...wut   That  39 s as melodramatic as Gersh Kuntzman  39 s AR 15 PTSD  Lmao what  Wouldn  39 t it be  quot hung black people quot

t3_kuq3hk,Capitol cop led DC rioters away from open Senate chambers door before it was locked likely saving lives,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuq3hk/capitol_cop_led_dc_rioters_away_from_open_senate/,Are they saying they saved the lives of Trump supporters that would have been shot by the police  or are they saying the Trump supporters were going to kill people     gt  including one with a semiautomatic weapon   Lol no I don  39 t think they do  I know  and its truly hysterical that these people can be so against something that they do not even have a fundamental understanding about.  The way liberal subreddits are spinning this is  quot the black man used himself as red meat in a crowd of a bunch of white supremacist klansmen. what a hero  quot   Liberals only see people by their race sadly  Yeah that headline is all sorts of wacky. The cop led them away  and they followed  So maybe they weren  39 t rioting  And if that  39 s the case who was threatening whose life   Also  the capitol police LET THEM IN. How could they not have been prepared by having the doors locked ahead of time   The title is very one sided. The only bit of truth is the cop kept them away from the chamber.  Lives might have been in danger if everyone involved in the incident had been carrying a rifle along with a willingness to use it. Not coincidentally  that  39 s also what would have made it count as a  quot coup. quot   Just doing their part not to get cancelled. Might as well squash news outlets too since we are canceling everything.  Why were lives not at risk when Democrats stormed the Senate in 2018   Fuck these piece of shit rioters. I couldn t be more disappointed with this sub defending the same atrocities they condemned this summer  It s not about the rioters  it s about the double standards. One building is stormed  they re domestic terrorists. Antifa BLM torch thousands of buildings  cars  murder cops  and they re labeled mostly peaceful protestors. Personally I don t support what they did  but I m not going to condemn it either if that makes sense  Probably doesn t  and I know it s bad for the right with the media going into a frenzy over this. I ve even seen local newspapers with giant headlines    strong CAPITOL INVADED  strong  . But the election was stolen  people nationwide are upset. Some people have had enough with the bs in our  leaders . I don t have time to riot  or even protest  like most of us we work too much so the best we can do is talk about it on Reddit  until we re censored   Your morality is weak if it  39 s based on how the media frames things. It  39 s okay to condemn both the riots this summer and what happened in the Capitol. Anybody that decries one but not the other is frankly a hypocrite.  That s not what was said and you know it  No  my morality exactly as it was during the last dozen riots. Still strong and on point. I m tired of the double standards  If you don t like my opinion take your complaints to somewhere else. At least these people went after the ones they re angry at  tell me what the thousand plus businesses  amp  home owners did to deserve their property being destroyed. Or how looting clothing  electronics  and appliances helped their cause. If you re going to submit to the media BLM Antifa  that s on you. They at times were literally chanting about killing cops... You forget hardly any politician on the left condemned the violence and murders by the left  and continued to incite violence and uprising for years. Once right protests start destroying public property  I ll condemn it.   It is still important to note the differences between this  and the riots we have seen in the past year. One thing to note  is the scope  with the riots of the past year  we saw them burn loot destroy everything around them  here  we saw a focused outlet of frustration.  Nobody in this sub is defending violence   deleted   Look at the other comments on this comment thread and all of the excuses for why this riot isn t a disgrace   deleted   OP literally replied to my original comment saying BLM the media is why they wouldn t condemn the riot.   That in no way is defending the riots  there is virtually no one here that doesn  39 t think rioting in all instances are bad  pointing out the double standards doesn  39 t mean that one is suddenly good.  Not condemning the riot is defending it.  Probably the dumbest fucking thing I  39 ve read today  I  39 ve only looked at a few supporters of this   they  39 re generally not people that have been here for a while. A number have deleted their comment history. Honestly  it  39 s time to take the sub private I think....take the time to clean house.  So start condeming your own Republican leaders  too. They want blood NOW but during the riots this summer...they did nothing to help stop it.  So...there would have been some fisticuffs leading to deaths    quot Saving Lives quot ....maybe the lives of the rioters I suppose.  I didn  39 t know selfies are lethal.  Has anyone explained the guy with zipcuffs yet  Cause you know....you don  39 t need zipcuffs for selfies...not the NORMAL selfies anyway...  A couple larpers. Not a threat.  Fire extinguishers are  So why are they prosecuting the people taking selfies  and not the ones swinging fire extinguishers.  Because they dont know who hit him in the face with the fire extinguisher and ultimately killed him. They  39 re still looking for him you donut.   Ok redditor  I  39 m sure the crowd was armed with fire extinguishers and ready to attack some senators. You can  39 t be delusional enough to think anything would  39 ve happened.  Im delusional  YOURE delusional. The cop DID get hit over the head with a fire extinguisher. And any time a mob breaks into a building and is kicking down doors i wont be surprised when someone defends their life. Its not hard to be beat to death by a mob swinging fists and kicking people to death  Looking at the streams any violence seems to have been isolated incidents  except when they initially pushed through the cops.  I didnt say it wasnt. I said they smashed a cops face in with a fire extinguisher which you implied was some conspiracy  But I didn  39 t.  Most of the ones reported in the news died from heart attack  stroke  or cop bullet  so not sure how they assume anything about lives.  The stroke one was in the hospital because a rioter smashed his head with a fire extinguisher. Be honest with your framing. We all hate when the left does it  no reason to lie about what happened  Someone had messaged me calling me out about me questioning how a stroke was related to the riots. My comment of course  from the day after  and there was lots of conflicting information. Sorry to say  but they aren  39 t framing it incorrectly  the media did report that an officer died from a stroke  and left out the context of being on life support after being beaten with a fire extinguisher.  That is the cop who had a stroke  I believe. I am talking about an article that said one of the protesters died of a stroke and the way it was worded sounded to me like he never even GOT to the protest  yet they were counting him as a death from the protest. i am not 100  sure if he made it to it or not  though.

The craziest part was seeing how many PH tabs i have open.  O  0  Other statements show up with different things when you do that. It almost seems like a predictive search query or something... definitely weird though  Is the proverbial shit about to hit the fan   It seems to me like a good faith move towards Biden now. Knowing that the result is unlikely to be changed now Trump would not block FEMA from making sure that transition is secure from all fears about the possibility of any sort of repetition from the Capitol.  Is this a pre cursor to insurrection

This of course will benefit the mega corporations that bankrolled Biden s campaign and can afford to comply with any regulations  while crushing smaller businesses that provide competition  Recession here we come. As a business owner  I have been dreading the Left getting control again.  Maybe Joe won  39 t get inaugurated  Hard to hope for it now. It seems all the avenues to combat the fraud have failed and people are no longer fighting.  Now in retribution phase  so it  39 s time for blood on the lintel hoping the hate passes over their household.  Businesses have waited 8 years for Obama to leave office. Why do you think the stock market exploded during the trump years    And now we will be heading into a recession  I  39 m at the point where since my job won  39 t be effected by biden at all  idgaf. These liberals who voted for biden to ship out their jobs oversea deserve it.   Right as I m graduating from law school. Woohoo   We could end up with hyperinflation. We  39 ve already been promised so many of the lead up actions  mandated prices  confiscation  in keeping with SJW and Green goals  domestic companies regulated and taxed  out of existence   forced reduction in energy production  government created shortages. Biden Harris will have to print more money and government spending is going to continue going through the roof.  So basically  Biden promised the American people that they  39 ll soon get to live in Argentina.  Zero doubt here

No  those are Agents.  You can say whatever you want if it s against the right.  Twitter s response to the complaint was   We conducted an investigation and have determined Ms. Banks is a liberal so no violation occurred.   Oh  she  39 s no liberal. She just went on a rant on Parlor about liberals. But then again  she is bat shit crazy  so who really knows.  She  39 s part of the victim class that liberals have given permission to to do or say anything.  Maybe she was being nice.  Maybe she wants a train and was just wishing Palin luck with this.   s  It s less because she s liberal than because her target is Republican  that makes it okay  s  This is the real reason.  no bad tactics  only wrong targets  Isn t this something the police should be investigating   Nope. Police exist only for coffee and recycling violations.  Palin is hoping that Banks herself shows up. She d tear her ass a new one.  Clearly AWS should cancel Twitter  39 s contract  Hey Banks  children playing with matches often get burned  Wow. Dats fucked up.  In a way you know she knows what she is talking about. She didn t get a record deal w o a bunch of old  ashey dicks stuffed in her face.  As I ve already said 3 times today  F Twitter  So this person has legal ties to Elon. She  39 s named in litigation..  Yeah  but this is from 2016  things have totally changed and such because oRaNgE mAn BaD.  The Left is now beyond pretending they are even handed and fair minded.

Funny how that works.  Where was this when BLM and antifa riots killed and injured officers  How about those two officers who were ambushed a few weeks back  What about David Dorn   The flag was at half mast for almost the entire year.  I guess the media was too busy denying the violence to report on that then.  No amount of downvoting will make your post untrue.  Is this going to last all the way till inauguration  That would be some classic trump shade  100  make the dems raise it to full mast and show they don  39 t care  Like usual.

Having millions of people who sincerely worship a higher power ABOVE the government  is a damned good thing in my book.  Seems like you see the role religion plays in society. You should do some thinking about doing some Bible learning.  My beliefs are sincerely held  but thank you   Do you think it s bad that society and it s people are becoming more disconnected from religion  That s a complicated question. I think a big percentage of humans are hard wired to seek religion. And when they eschew theology  they often end up worshipping some scary things. Like government. My most strongly held beliefs about religion is that Americans deserve almost unfettered access to it because of its profound importance to people s lives and identities. I m very upset about churches closing for covid  I don t think that s constitutional in any way.   Thanks for explaining. I also agree that government worship or attachment to ideas like inclusion and progressivism is very religious in nature. Filling a god shaped hole in people s hearts as Shapiro says.  Highly recommend the Dwell app  They ll ban it  This world needs Jesus more than ever     To find him or his return   Both  Yes.  Thank you for the love  everyone. Cowards are giving me hate in my DMs. I just keep reminding them that God loves them. Bless you all     Until religion becomes illegal  then that will be banned too  This is amazing.  We need it.  Big Tech is probably about to cancel Jesus for not being trans.  s  Great  but there are multiple  opposing  interpretations of said passages that most listeners have to rifle through     It s so hard to explain to people that they actually need to study the Bible  not just take a preacher s or a 5 minute devotional s word for it.  so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth  it shall not return to me empty  but it shall accomplish that which I purpose  and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it   so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth  it shall not return to me empty  but it shall accomplish that which I purpose  and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it

Racist grass and sand   But orange grass and sand bad  I expect DT to announce that the PGA is hereby banned from having any Championships played on his courses.  Oh no   Hahaha these sheep are desperate and petty as usual....    How many potential customers does Trump have on any given day after he leaves the WH.   THIS IS SURELY THE END FOR DRUMPF   1   The walls are closing in   How long have you been screaming that. Lol  They are making Trump the enemy  1. This is ridiculous.  He has been since he announced that he was running for President. Then they went at him harder when he beat HRC. Then they went at him even harder when he didn  39 t start WW3  made peace in NK and Russia. They actually wanted the opposite to happen  just so they could say  quot we told ya so  quot . Now they feel stupid. Which is weird  because a guy with green hair and a shitty beard saying that he  39 s a female is pretty stupid.  Very true. And it s nice to see a fellow Bostonian here as well  Hope all is well  We  39 re in the belly of the beast here. Head on a swivel  bud.

The GOP was never on Trumps side  and I think that is very evident right now.  You are giving GOP congresscritters far too much credit. When they had the trifecta  they had to put up or shut up  so we got all sorts of  quot uhhh  when we said we should repeal Obamacare what we really meant was .... quot .   Yeah  people claim he had 2 years to do things  but not really. The person who actually had 2 years was Obama during his first 2 years. They could have combated  quot systemic racism quot  then and there.  Gotta love the ACLU both shitting on Trump but using his situation to push their own agenda simultaneously.  since the government is on the same team as these corporations  what exactly is there to do to bring down big tech   it is scary how 5  6 companies can control so much  Good. Someone has too. Biden sure as shit wont. They just got him elected  Trump  39 s gonna milk his last days in office so badass lmao  4 more years  baby  Correct me if I  39 m wrong but hasn  39 t Trump already conceded    quot conceded quot   He also said hes planning for a peaceful transition of power  hes already in power  transition means change.  if we  39 re in open insurrection the 20th is null and void  I thought some bill  cant remember the name  meant the insurrection act could only be used with Congress  39  approval   the courts can figure that out.  Considering the court  39 s actions recently  I have big doubts they  39 d back Trump  stop him  Well  a bit too late  but I  39 m glad he  39 s at least gonna go for it in the last few days I guess  Good but you knew this was coming since alex jones and the donald was banned. Would been a good time when you guys controlled congress.  This maybe his most important work as President of the US.  Lindsey Graham made a comment about this and Trump but shows he  39 s just a coward and turncoat. He was nowhere to be seen when they had the Senate...  Thank God   Far too late.  No one cares what he has to say now and anything he does will be seen as revenge and overturned by Biden.  Dealing with tech companies  especially in regards to free speech needed to be done a few years ago  not when he  39 s on the way out the door with zero power or legislative support.  Too little too late.  There is a word for Big Tech s pursuit of political power

Everyone agrees what happened at the capital is awful  and those responsible should be prosecuted.  But get the fuck out of here with this unprecedented bullshit when this kind of disruption and violence has been a Leftist go to tactic for decades.  Get the fuck out of here with your claims of Trumps incitement  when you cant even point to a quote that was inciting  while all the while ignoring actual incitements from Pelosi  Waters  Sanders  and Omar.  And get the fuck out of here with your claims of sacred territory  when you were hapoy to celebrate the disruptions during the Kavanaugh hearings.   removed   Dont downplay it.  People still died and it was something that NEVER should have happened.  But the hypocrisy is sickening.   removed    removed    removed   This exactly. People are quick to condemn anyone not agreeing with the narrative but let s keep what happened in perspective. Riots this last summer were far worse and I m pretty sure politicians are just mad because someone trashed their office. It s a little different having it happen to you rather than watching it on tv.  LMFAO.  All the unflaired replies Im getting are  quot but... but... Trump told people to fight quot   as if no politician in history has used that phrase before and only Trump completely meant it literally.   removed   They are hoping that there is another incident at inauguration so they can use it to turn the facisim dials to 11.  If they go through with this  it has nothing to do with Trump and everything to do with weeding out Republican loyalists. It is a test and intended to divide Republicans even more.  And they  39 re going to get nowhere just like the Mueller investigation...  Have they crawled out from under their desks yet   On what grounds   What crime did Trump commit 
t3_kuw4nt,Loss of Amazon support could force Parler to shut down CEO warns,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuw4nt/loss_of_amazon_support_could_force_parler_to_shut/,So  the left tells us that if we  quot believe quot  in free markets  we should just start our own and compete.  Yeah but shut up you alt right nazi sexist.  I don  39 t agree with what AWS did  but it  39 s foolish to play the free market argument here. These companies acted freely.  Hopefully  people begin seeing the danger Big Tech represents.  So far  the people seem to be celebrating this as a good thing... insane   The left is so stupid it  39 s insane. Like they all seem to agree these mega corporate are the bad guys for countless  countless reasons. So hey brain dead idiots  if all the biggest most evil things in the world are so far on your side and trying to silence the other  did you ever stop to think even for a sec  maybe just maybe you are the bad guys     Can we pool enough money for parler to start from scratch  Is it technically possible   The infrastructure required would be in the millions.  And it would require a massive increase of employment at Parler just to manage that infrastructure.  And that would also require talented experienced professionals who probably already work at Twitter Google just to know the basics.  Sometimes even money won t solve problems.  Money is necessary but not enough. Oh shush  I forgot Parler might have no means to receive any donations soon.  Why are you being downvoted  Are my questions not legit  I saw Gab asking for donations.  Its probably brigaders and trolls  This is censorship at this point  Amazon already pulled the plug...  Why gab.com comments are downvoted   This subreddit is constantly being swarmed by leftist clowns.  I  39 m guessing few if any Conservatives go into left wing reddits to cause trouble  but leftist are like a bad rash.  its time to drop that amazon prime subscription  If you go someplace else on the Internet to purchase  you are probably doing your buy over an Amazon server.  The size and reach of Amazon is scary massive.  Canceled mine yesterday  was due for renewal later this month.  Same here  i hope they go out of biz or at least hurt a little  Time to goto gab  Gab.com  Is chance it could be saved  I wouldn t have a problem with Big Tech banning anyone IF there was actually a free market.   They need to start a Gofundme to get their own servers.  Yeah  but go fund me would shut them down instantly

How very brave   And bold  Oh no.  Ughh I thought wokeness wouldn t reach golf.  This really only hurts the people that won t have jobs because of this  albeit season temporary jobs but still. Probably doesn t impact Trump too much aside from his ego.  I don  39 t watch golf anyway

t3_kuo0ec,Email Service Suspends Trumps Account Cutting a Vital Link to His Supporters,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuo0ec/email_service_suspends_trumps_account_cutting_a/,Just think about this for one moment  President Trump is still President and he has been basically cut off from communicating with the country. Yeah he can go on the news  but that  39 s about it  and I would be interested if they would even carry him on the news now.  MSNBC and CNN cut away from Trumps covid briefings several times. I have no doubt they d scoff at airing a live statement from him  MANY naive conservative on this sub say that he isn t cut off. He can go on tv at anytime  Right  If they can do that to a sitting President imagine what they could do to us peasants.  The news were the first to block him  which was the entire reason he was forced to use alternative ways of getting his message out. Since even before he won the primary  he was being censored and shut down.  this is what communists do. they disappear their political opposition.  Got a screenshot or something of that   it was a video statement I believe. I  39 m sure it was mirrored on his telegram account  Seeing on youtube that he signed the insurrection act  but no source for that. If it  39 s true shits gonna get weird.   a href  https   i.imgur.com 97jgAwN.jpg  this guy is saying it. among others.  a     a href  https   tenor.com tJ0e.gif  rel  nofollow  Oh damn.  a   Damn. Even email  If tech may think they are doing Democrat bidding  but all this is making all Americans uncomfortable. It s unconstitutional  What are Americans going to do about it  Nothing.  USA has become insanely brainwashed  from the racial genders theories taught in schools  in corporations  identity politics everywhere in entertainment  cities being heavily dominated by democrats supporters... it s like a cancer spreading. You see clear censorship  propaganda and these guys are just praising it  even the deaths of the people at the Capitol.  People have become too comfortable. If it s convenient for them  then the system is fine. They don t care about anyone else but themselves essentially. That whole  first it happened to them  thing fits this situation perfectly.  Well  I would have some sort of hope if we didn t already see these companies cross the line before Trumps first term. There were two years for the GOP to do something about it. They did NOTHING. And now they will not get another chance. This is a blitz to make conservative values disappear forever. And they already won.  In the us and in the academic system and can confirm. Some things bypass even me  which is scary.  Also it  39 s idiotic in that they will just make people more mad  not less so. lol.  RIP 1A  thanks to the radical left and their fascist movement freedom of speech is going out the door. Meanwhile the politicians can call for sedition for 4 years  social media allowed for calling to violence against any trump supporter  Cathy griffin had the presidents decapitated head in a photoshoot  and it s all acceptable.  RIP the constitution  search  quot abolish the constitution quot  and you  39 ll be surprised.  Well then. There  39 s really only one alternative if you  39 re still on the Trump Train  pen  paper  and stamps.  If lib voters were sane  they  39 d se the true colors of the liberal movement now and switch over to the republican party. What a bunch of babies the people owning these companies and the media are. lol.  By censoring Trump  I can  39 t help but feel that they  39 ve given him the opportunity to toil in silence and to meticulously plan his next moves. I really wonder what he  39 s doing now that  he  39 s been removed from major platforms  Liberals are going to turn on each other now that they don  39 t have anything new from Trump. It  39 s going to be glorious.  That  39 s the thing about all of this...  Good point. And that s their miscalculation. They all think they re together and advocating these tactics to destroy their current enemy. After all  the end justifies the means. They re completely ignorant of the fact that at some point they ll be on the wrong side of it all and these tactics will be used against them.  he  39 s on telegram at least for now. good app. secure and encrypted.
t3_kusu3n,Rep. Cori Bush looks to expel GOP members of Congress using the 14th Amendment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kusu3n/rep_cori_bush_looks_to_expel_gop_members_of/,What happened to  unity    Empty propaganda. Resembles China s   Two Systems One Country  when they took over Hong Kong.  I don  39 t know  man  but this smells like what commies did in NK  USSR  China  etc when they wanted to consolidate party rule...  Is there any way forward. The democrats clearly are bloodthirsty and conservatives have no way to communicate with dems.   This absolutely sounds more like an actual coup   I believe we are already in America s second Civil War. It s just a Cold Civil War at the moment though. The divide among Americans is so deep. Neither side trusts the other. Something like George Floyd s killing could have been a time for Americans to come together and say  Wow  we need to do more to ensure this doesn t happen again   I don t think I ever talked with anyone that thought it was ok. At least until the full body cam footage was released and after watching that. I can better understand the officers but still think they did the wrong things. Most Americans  regardless of political leanings  agreed that it was a terrible thing to happen. Instead  the left turned it into a race thing  as they usually do  and used it to label all cops as racist.  I completely agree with your George Floyd point. 300 million  people watched that video with hearts breaking. We could have had a real chance at a movement to address police brutality and aggression but that wasn  39 t good enough for the left. They burned our cities under the false flag of racism when we could have had real change in how we train and insure the safety of both the people and police.  Exactly  a time that could have been used to heal the deep and growing divide between Americans was instead used as a club with which the left again accused anyone who disagreed with them a racist. They don t want unity and never have wanted it.  Wait what  Who did George Floyd kill   No one  he was killed.  Oh  I see. You have only seen a small part of that video of him being arrested. Gotcha.    No  I ve watched the whole video. I say he was killed because that s what happened. Would he have died that day had he not interacted with the police  Whether or not he died due to a combination of being high and the stress of interacting with the police or the officer s knee on his neck is still up for debate. I think both parties  the officers and George Floyd  did things wrong.  Yes he had three times the lethal amount of fentanyl in his system  that s why he couldn t breathe.  I m sure the large amounts of meth and fentanyl had nothing to do with it.  Came here to say it seems like battle lines are being drawn.  I REALLY don t think they ll go through with this.  So much for reconciliation.  They only want reconciliation of there is part of  quot truth and reconciliation. quot   So is secession finally on the table   Please  I wish more people would honestly push for this.  Honest question  how would a secession work best for both parties  States vote  So red states would be their own countries or together  Just thinking about it my state  Florida is red  but Georgia is blue and all the states surrounding Georgia are red.  I would think states would have to vote. Depending on the results there may have to be some tweaks to the lines. This is stuff way above my paygrade. It is the only bloodless idea I can come up with  all other roads are going down a dark path.  Wondering the same thing. I live closer to west coast  so would those states be cut off from the other blue states   Seriously. The left can have their communist dictatorship.  Just know that half the country want no part of that insanity.  This needs to happen. What ever state does this will have an immediate influx of money and conservatives. Let the left go left  the right go right and see who wins the battle of economy.  I  39 ve already started discussing with my wife moving from Colorado to Texas.  I love it here in Colorado  grew up here.  The last few years I was in the navy I just wanted to get the fuck out of San Diego and get back.  The main problem is my job is tied to the state now.  So I  39 m getting set to start researching engineering firms in Texas.  I would prefer to stay here and try to bring conservatism back here but I  39 m not sure if that  39 s likely.  We are doing the same. It is getting to the point where I don  39 t feel safe for my family. If there is a state to kick off the movement it is tx.  Or SC  those crazy bastards  Avoid the crazy rush  Idaho is the place to be.  I ve always wanted to move to Montana. All that open land and great American views. So many beautiful places in the states  Nope. We would sit here enjoying our freedom and our own business  lol. If you want in the action  Texas or Montana.  Any crazy weather like tornadoes or such in Idaho  Sounds like a pleasant place.  Lots of snow  nothing extreme though.  Idaho is pretty up there for me.  I  39 m a Civil Engineer and my wife is a teacher.  So we can move just about anywhere.  I just want to be able to keep mountain biking as much as possible and get into hunting.  There is more engineering jobs in Texas so that and the rise in private mountain biking trails really makes me lean that way.  There is some great biking and outstanding outdoors up here in the northern area. Not a lot of engineering  but our hunting stayed open all covid long  lol.  Ya  I hear the biking is great.  But you can  39 t do it year round like you mostly can here in Colorado and can in Texas.  But at the end of the day its really about finding a good job  though.  I just graduated with my degree in May and my current employer gave me a great salary it was very obvious they believe in my potential.  Combination of my military service  academic record  and my motivation must have really impressed them.  I thank God everyday it worked out and I  39 m already making more money than I did in the navy as an E6.  So  really  if I can find another similar situation in Texas  Idaho  Montana  etc I  39 ll make the jump.  One bummer to all the work from home is Idaho became a possibility to lot more people  lol. Best of luck in all   I actually think this is all going to push the bill that s already filed in Texas to get serious consideration. It would call for a referendum in Texas on whether to leave the US.  We should really be talking reverse secession.  Need to kick out NY  Chicago  Philly  San Fran etc and make them independent city states like renaissance italy.  Then they can have whatever laws they want without bothering the rest of us.  I actually think this needs to happened. How would the country divide up though  Cali  Nevada  Colorado  Washington and Oregon would be cut off from the northeast coastal blue states. Although Nevada could go red.  We could start with a trial separation and see how it goes.  Texas is ready   let s leave this shit hole.  Protesting the results of an election isn t the same as attempting an insurrection   But they do have the majority needed to most of the things they want  if they can only enforce the division on party lines  no   As it stands  I think only some things.  Different kinds of policies need different degrees of majority  like passing a budget is different than impeachment  for example.  Indeed.  I think the progressive agenda is effectively on hold   can t see Joe Manchin or Diane Feinstein voting for open borders or free everything.  I don t know why anyone in WV votes for joe anymore. I can t stand the man.  Maybe  if they can create laws that appeal to their very broad membership.  I don t Joe Manchin signing off on open borders or universal healthcare  do you     How to start a civil war 101.  These people are going out of their way to make it impossible for each side to communicate. It s like they re intentionally trying to make the country come flying apart at the seams.  Fine by me  as long as we can kick out Schumer  Pelosi  AOC  Cuomo  and every other fuckking dem who is on camera inciting   39 rebellion  39  as is so well laid out.  Pelosi  by demanding his nuclear codes and attempting to take his military power and authority  is literally on paper as  quot attempted military coup quot   What should bother us is that the coverage on MSM is telling people she is both entitled to make the request and justified. Lots of stupid sheep out there.   removed    removed    removed    removed    removed    removed    removed    removed    removed    removed   So every democratic congressman that called for the abolition of the constitution will be thrown out correct. Because I  dont believe that invoking a constitutionally outlined process is in anyway act8ng against the constitution.  They had better be careful what they say and do  people are still genuinely pissed off and something like this can function as the catalyst.   Republicans will run and hide. That  39 s what they do best.  They  39 d have a decent case  unfortunately. Articles II and III of the 14th Amendment provide for the removal of elected officials who engaged in  quot insurrection and rebellion quot . It wouldn  39 t be so hard top stick it on the GOP.  I remember a group that kept telling me not to tolerate such intolerance... Seems like they were the ones behind it all along.  Exactly what the nazis did to their opposition in 1933... but who are the nazis again   What kind of democracy doesn t allow groups of violent protestors the ability to overturn legitimate elections results  Justice is gone   Overturning elections  RRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

I believe the reference is to the nuclear codes    a href  https   time.com 5928036 pelosi trump nuclear codes  amp true  https   time.com 5928036 pelosi trump nuclear codes  amp true  a   What a useless cunt. Outright treason and sedition  but reddit and the tech industry doesn  39 t seem to mind.  The tech companies and the MSM helped them do it.  Crazy times...  Can you imagine how desperate people will be for a MAGA redo after 4 years of Dems degrading of individual freedoms and quality of life  The only question is will there be any chance at all of a free and fair election in 2024.  Even if it s not a TRUMP 2024 ticket  at least we now know what we re looking for in a President  now.  Trump will be a far bigger threat to them after the presidency.  That is why they want to deprive him of all means of communication with his base.  The funniest thing about this is that she obviously fears he would win.  she isn  39 t the only one in congress. That  39 s why they are wanting it to move forward  She knows a second term of trump is opening the flood gates of investigations into the corruption in washington.  Unpopular opinion.   It looks like she d want to spend time with family  traveling and enjoying life. But I guess power is a helluva drug.  Rick James is that you    What if I want to vote for him again  Isnt that my right   I ll still vote for him.  Let s face it I would vote for a syphilitic  radioactive  mole rat before I vote democrat again.  What  39 s the difference   If it  39 s the right kind of radioactive mole rat it can aid in chemo   Well  she is very concerned about the will of the American people  judging by her recent rhetoric. If it is the will of the American people to elect Trump if he runs again  who is she to overturn our will   Pelosi isn  39 t concerned about the will of the American people  she  39 s concerned with power and nothing else.  LMAO    Pelosi is a deranged moron and obviously unfit for office.  Of course she does. Her laptop was stolen and most likely Trump has it lol  I certainly hope so.  I will celebrate that day Pelosi finally dies of her old age.  Or you know you could let the American people decide.  We  39 re not even allowed to decide who gets elected why let us decide who gets impeached.  By all means let  39 s waste a bunch of money on another failed removal attempt lol country  39 s doomed anyway. Welcome to The Great Reset  How do you erode a  US  government with communist and totalitarian tendencies  Start infiltrating it little by little and destroy it from within.  Sop she must be admitting he could win again  which means she doesn  39 t believe in her blue wave or that Biden can do good enough to even beat the same guy he supposedly beat this time.  She  39 s got less than two weeks and the impeachment process here takes at least a month based on our history  That assumes hearings and testimony. She can go straight for a vote in the House. The Senate will not take it up to remove him but given the makeup of the House  Trump will be impeached.  Who decides whether senate will take it up  McConnell   He can be impeached even after leaving office  strictly to prevent him from holding any office again.  But he has already been impeached. What would make this any different   No shit.  This is what it is about  and the gop 2024 hopefuls will be voting to impeach too  bit they fail to see that will make them ineligible to the conservative voters  I would like to put my foot in her mouth to keep her from speaking again but I realize that that would be a bad thing for America and American ideals. I love my country enough that even if I had the opportunity  I would not do it. Too bad she either lacks the love of country or lacks the sense to know that her statements and actions are hurting our country.  The 25th amendment talk is stupid  but either way Trump shouldn t run in the future.  But that won  39 t stop him from running again. A conviction in the senate would be necessary  and let  39 s face it  if they get 2 3s to convict him a week before he leaves office  there will be a civil war.  MAGA 2024. Its clear they are scared of Trump running again  since they won  39 t be able to cheat as easily with mail ins. Unless their chinease friends create another pandemic...  She s just terrified because of what CIA operatives have found on her laptop. Her days are numbered.  Wasn  39 t it just a random aide  39 s laptop  What evidence is there that the CIA has it  as opposed to some rando that rioted at the Capitol   If in fact it was just some aids laptop she wouldn t be going around so frantically demanding that Pence enact the 25th amendment upon trump also trying to get a top general to nullify trumps authority upon the military and the Pentagon. Otherwise she would just be waiting out the time knowing that he s out of office in a matter of days. There s a lot going on in the world and if you stay adamant about research and connect the dots. One can see there s a hell of a lot going on that most Americans are completely oblivious to.  Trump 2024  Trump needs to be mayor. He  39 d actually have more fun telling Liberals to fuckoff.  Trump is going to mop the floor with her this week.  How so   Biden won the presidency and Trump will still be everything the dems talk about and shape policy around.

t3_kuqqgs,Conservative WalkAway group kicked off Facebook amid purge moves to CloutHub,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuqqgs/conservative_walkaway_group_kicked_off_facebook/,I think all this purging is gonna bite the leftists in the ass eventually.  I think a lot of people who voted for Biden simply because they didn t like Trump are in for a huge wake up call. The left is once again collectively losing their minds even when they won. Lots of people didn t vote foe this shit and they won t vote for it again. The left need to get their act together and govern  not spend the next 2 years seeking revenge. If they don t  they re gonna be back out on their asses.  Most people didn t vote for Biden. Rather they voted against Trump. The Biden presidency is going to be a rude wake up call to people  more rude than they perceived Trump to be. Will people then see the wisdom of Trump or will they still be in denial  eg.   there is a better way than Biden or Trump    Biden has to do this protect us from fascists    My bet is on the latter. The amount of simping in America is unbelievable.  The  protecting us from fascists  thing is already being questioned by many that didn t like Trump. This is why the left has to keep the outraged shitstorm going. The funny thing is  they re still giving Trump the attention he wants AND making themselves look even more unhinged. The next 2 years are going to be interesting but if they can t get past Trump  the midterms are going to be a shit storm for the left.  I hope that you are correct. I have lost faith in the American electorate. And even if the American electorate wants change in 2022  the establishment may rig the elections forever. All of America could be a one party state like California is today.  One of the things I saw in this cycle that gives me hope was specific to Ca. The Republican Party decided to use the new rules the Dems enacted that lost them Congressional seats in 2018. By playing like the Dems  they took back several seats with the likelihood of taking back more. These are all seats in very right leaning districts. We just need to play as dirty as they do and use the same tactics.  That is what I am hoping for.  All of this shit will.  But what exactly did Walkaway do worthy of being kicked off  I m sure the reason is BS  but what was their BS reason   This is the most concerning ban I  39 ve seen this week. They didn  39 t even give a reason based on what the leaders like Karlyn and Brandon said. They just straight up banned them  AND all the administrators personal accounts too. This is the most blatant political bans I  39 ve seen. There  39 s absolutely no justification for it other than the fact that they were running a page which directly countered the Democrat party  My goodness. This is outright facism. I wonder how they will react. Will they organize and protest  Will that be acceptable to the establishment like BLM

He was such a threat  they took the weekend off .  What the hell is wrong with this lady  Seriously   Fear. Serious fear. Of what  I don  39 t know  but these are the actions of someone who is afraid.  I don  39 t think it is fear  I think it is power. They believe they are untouchable and that the will of the American people are on their side. So they will silence any opposition and do whatever they want. I think reality will hit them hard  but I am scared as to what that reality will look like.  you don  39 t know   Doubt it  if he did he would have used it.  Durham report. DNI report. Assange is now on the board.  Grew up in a mafia family.  Says the woman who literally tried to stage a fucking coup.  Not tried to. They did.  This is the third time this past week. She went to the military and asked to stage a coup against the president because of  quot nuclear codes quot  and the military refused. Just a few moments ago  she threatened Pence to invoke the 25th amendment and now  she  39 s forcing a vote over the articles of impeachment without even having a hearing or testimony in the house and senate.  I initially thought it was just theatre for the left and msm to slurp  but no. This is a person showing fear.  This is sorta like how Stalin went insane out of fear against Tito  Yugoslavian dictator  when his assassination attempt of Tito failed multiple times. He then was scared to death that Tito would come back at him out of revenge  so Stalin started having people around him killed for  quot conspiring against him quot  until the stress gave himself a brain hemorrhage and killed him.  it  39 s what i keep saying. this is odd behavior for people that supposedly won and only have 10 days left of Trump  39 s presidency. there  39 s no logical reason for them to behave this way.  This assumes she ever was sane to begin with.  Nancy Pelosi has been a partisan clown my entire life.  SEDITIOOOOOOON   Two simple questions everyone should be asking the Democrats   Well  he DID have that picture of KFC with a fork and knife. He was going to attack that chicken  man.  I kind of get it... using a fork and knife to eat KFC is pretty much a crime against humanity.  And theres the video of eating pizza with a fork and knife with Sarah Palin in NYC    quot A threat to our democracy quot .... They say it over and over but I  39 d give a million dollars to any leftist who can actually give 1 reason why.  America is a federal republic built of independent states  We are not a democracy  and our founding fathers rejected democracy because the passions of the mob were too easily manipulated  and the majority could too easily deprive the minority of their rights.  Checks and balances were built in to limit the power of the mob and protect minority rights.  That seems like the one thing guaranteed to start the next civil war.  Pelosi  queen of sedition.  Want to cringe  Watch the 60 minute interview with her and Leslie Stahl. It was comical.  This woman is looney like a toon  They just want to stop Trump from running next time. They re pushing the narrative of sedition in order to sell the attempt to voters.  Yes I agree they are pushing the  sedition  narrative. That way anybody associated with Trump can be branded as a seditionist too  including current legislators. They are already calling for people like Cruz and Hawley to step down.  That can  39 t be right. I think they  39 re scared of him doing something now. Because if they clear him out now there is no 2024 unless revolution  Do what  His term ends in 10 days. Take a step back and first ask why the Democrats want you to believe Trump is the threat they claim he is. Why do they want you to believe that  Why push an impeachment when it would take effect after he leaves office   Maybe to discount any evidence that had been collected on the vote fraud  Just like the Capitol invasion stopped any Congressional probe into the election  this action by Pelosi would forestall any further investigation of voter fraud by anyone unwilling to be painted as a lunatic.  You say that but once he  39 s out of office he  39 s out of power. People that despise him already do. People that don  39 t will not be swayed by further dirt dragging. We  39 ll just have to see. In fact them pushing harder will probably cement his followers further.  it  39 s all just so crazy isn  39 t it.  2 3 majority to remove  but only a simple majority  51  to bar from future office.  Where is that written   Cornell Law. There s precedent from 1907 and 1936. See footnote 856.   It s a high bar and it s not impossible. Romney and Murkowski would vote for it. There are most likely others. Graham isn t a friend of Trumps. I suspect McConnell isn t going to stand for election again so he may.  McConnell apparently said he would never speak to Trump again after the 20th. Whether he cares about his future after this term or not  he should still consider doing the right thing  not for Trump  but for this country  amp  our constitution. Don  39 t get me wrong though I know I  39 m asking a lot here.  McConnell  Graham  Collins  Toomey  Sasse  Murkowski  Rubio and Romney would go for it. There are others as well.   Rubio goes that route  and I  39 d vote for a literal turd over him in the primary.  Rubio shouldn t be trusted   Jed Bush was a mentor to the man and he betrayed him in 2015.  Still need just 34 to say No.  Mcconnell has already said he  39 s not going to even look at it until after Trump is out of office  What does that tell you  The Republican establishment wants Trump out of the picture.  There s a few Republican snakes on the senate  but I m not sure if there are 17 of them. Romney  Collins  Murskowski  Toomey  and Sasse are the ones I can see voting yes. Then they would need 12 more after that. Won t happen.  Unless they divide the Republicans and win a large majority in 2022. Could they put vote off until then   Seems that she is more of an imminent threat to our republic.  She should be impeached and more.   removed   No kidding. It s like they want there to be more pissed off people.  bitch  you just stole a presidential election using chinese vote machines. maybe you should sit this one out  The imminent threat to our democracy are the Leftists salivating over the oppressive and racist legislation they are going to pass.  Okay blah blah political posturing.  Can she at least prove if we currently have a democracy     quot Let  39 s remove our democratically elected leader to save our democracy quot   She  39 s deranged and needs to be in a nursing home...  Keep on Treasonous drunk bitch.  Is she really this dumb  They  quot won quot  the election. Biden takes over in 10 days. What  39 s the threat to democracy she  39 s claiming   If he s impeached he can t run again. This is about 2024  they are terrified.  I cringe every time I  quot to our democracy. quot  We are not a democracy  you idiot.  Why not run the clock out  Hey  this is unrelated to this except for the fact that Pelosi is a cunt  but has anyone seen a whole bunch of users suddenly start following them  I apparently now have eight followers  and although I ve blocked five people  I ve gone back several days worth of notifications and it seems like those accounts have followed me multiple times  even though I blocked them. Is there anyway to see a follower list  so I can get rid of these people  I don t like the idea of people I don t know following me on read it with the insanity going on right now. Quite frankly  I m tempted to nuke my account and start over  On reddit  Not possible  fam. If I did  I would  39 ve done it already to only get around 50 dms from lib shills who want to debate me or call me the most outrageous racist insults instead of the run of the mill  quot n    r  quot   quot c  n  quot   quot uncle tom  quot  and etc to get an amazing laugh  I have had a few randoms follow me. Strange.  Honestly  it kind of freaks me out  because I m 80  certain that anyone who would follow someone on Reddit is probably up to no good  at least when it comes to following someone like me  who spends 99  of my time and read it on conservative leaning political sub Reddits  Get rid of personal social media. Use a VPN. Use several secured emails. Use duck duck go. Do what you can to stay off the radar  Just as we had this conversation I got 2 new random followers. You can click on their profile and block them.  I am with you on that. We are entering a frightening period and we are the targets.  My life is dealing with crazy old ladies  mom  sister  wife  sisters in law .  I know crazy when I see it.  Menopause isn  39 t pretty.  Time for Trump to declassify everything...  The Baba Yaga of bureaucrats
t3_kun491,Wednesday was Americas Kristallnacht Schwarzenegger compares MAGA riot to Nazi atrocity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kun491/wednesday_was_americas_kristallnacht/,I ve counted 4 major public figures in politics who have now compared Trump and his supporters and allies to nazis.   One whose father was an actual Nazi.  This  Fuq yoo azzhole    He  39 ll be back....  Good luck with your FIL  Chris Pratt  More like Reichstag Fire  It resulted in all but one Republican withdrawing their objections to the certification of the election.  That I don  39 t get. They can punish Trump but it doesn  39 t change a single thing in regard to the election fraud  still happened  Wasn t the reichstag fire nazis burning the reichstag and blaming communists allowing the Nazis to get away with whatever they wanted  The only people who benefitted from storming the Capitol were democrats  It  39 s still unclear whether or not the Nazi  39 s started the fire at the Reichstag themselves.  What is indisputable is that they then exploited the public  39 s fear of a communist insurrection to catapult themselves into absolute power.  Yeah I read more into it after I typed that  apparently they believe it was started by a communist  but the Nazis managed to blame the entire communist party  That  39 s one theory I heard. That the left allowed or even encouraged it to happen so that they could crack down on the right.  It showed which ones actually believed and which ones were posturing to look better to their constituents.  It s like these people read one history book or are only aware of one period of history. Everything is  Nazis ... wtf are these people even talking about   They don t actually care about history  these are just words that they realize are effective in convincing people to hate their opposition. They re fighting  fascism  with actual fascism  Except Kristalnacht targeted Jewish civilians  while this targeted corrupt politicians. Only leftist mobs have targeted civilians.  This is an embarrassing take by Schwarzenegger.  It  39 s totally fine to condemn the violence from Wednesday but to compare it to the Nazis is extremely divisive  dishonest  and hyperbolic.  I wouldn  39 t expect anything different from someone in the Hollywood bubble though.  I agree with you  but I would expect more from Arnie.  He was a middle of the road republican.  He managed California very well.  Our DMV had less than a 5 minute wait.  He was all about making government workers actually do their jobs.    Sorry  Arnie  you have no fucking idea what you  39 re talking about. It  39 s a shame when people get older and still think they  39 re connected to what  39 s going on. The Left has been committing violence against people for months  where  39 s the outrage over that   Their real issue was that Trump exposed their game. That s what this was always about.  Smoke another cigar in your mansion and tell the ppl to stay locked down.  Except kristallnacht was a 3 day long event that hurt businesses and not the government. The night of broken glass is more akin to the last 9 months of protests by BLM that actually hurt businesses rather than the government excluding portland and the federal court.  do you guys understand that the left is literally rewriting history now  in the future they  39 ll say 1 6 21 was  quot the darkest day in US history quot  because we suffered a  quot domestic terror attack. quot  your grandchildren will read about this in their textbooks and I can guarantee by then they  39 ll erase all good accomplishments made by Trump  39 s presidency to the point where he  39 ll look like Hitler in comparison. this is already happening and it  39 s only been 4 days.  Truth  The winners write the history. Dems are playing for keeps.  Where was he when BLM was destroying our cities   Probably sitting in his mansion not giving a fuck. It was only after the elites were threatened that these people started caring.  These people are so disconnected from reality.  I cannot think of anyone more out of touch with the average American than Arnold fucking Schwarzenegger  It was actually more like the Night of the Long Knives when the Nazis cracked down on internal dissidents  or Stalin  39 s purges.  R pol is here. Lol  take yer down votes in stride folks. The more you have the more honest the comment... The left just simply can  39 t stand truth...  Another fake  quot republican quot  who didn  39 t like trump just due to his words.  Literally the joke of the internet  you know they have zero argument when they start calling you hitler or a Nazi.  He  39 s projecting to cover that his father was a Nazi.  Coming from a Republican  although too moderate for this crowd  I will take this more seriously. Firstly  Kristallnacht was not an attack on government. Second  it was planned. Third  it included paramilitary. So  nothing like this protest that appears to have not killed anyone intentionally.  Left acting like the  quot rioters quot  actually hurt killed politicians. Maybe if the  quot rioters quot  actually got rid congress members then this reaction we are seeing may be valid.  He is just pissed cause the new maid is too hot for him to procreate with.  How is this like kristallnacht  I don t think any private businesses were targeted  I lived in California during his term. He did absolutely nothing for Californians  certainly not for conservatives. Raised taxes  in fact.  To be fair  he tried to take down the teachers union  but failed   he tried to be conservative initially but with Dems owning every part of the government  he decided he can be re elected and become popular by becoming a liberal  Randy Quaid  you got competition.  The Austrian has lost his fucking mind. After this I hope he will  em not  em  be back.......  I used to respect this man  until now. He s just another pawn  all pissy because Trump talked shit about him taking over the apprentice and doing a crappy ass job. No one sticks to facts anymore. It s all opinions and misdirection. Shame on you  Arnie.  Stop being stupid  Arnie  Pretty bold coming from an Austrian.  Does that mean that the discussion is over  Godwin  39 s Law and all that   A dumb weightlifter  What a lunatic  My mom worked at People Magazine in the 80s and has seen pictures of Arnold s dick...he s the most famous micro penis sufferer in the world. Supposed to be about  2 inches erect
t3_kuronr,BREAKING Pelosi Gives Pence 24hrs To Activate 25th Amendment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuronr/breaking_pelosi_gives_pence_24hrs_to_activate/,Unity my ass.  What does FIFY mean   Fixed it for ya  Ah ok thanks  No problem  She is genuinely  em trying  em  to provoke a backlash.   removed   ill believe the special forces shit when i see it lol thats a little too conspiratorial for me  Agree. But something has congress flailing about. We  39 ll find out eventually.  She  39 s been quot trying quot  shit forever.  The republicans picking a side part is why i hope impeachment happens where we can see which republicans to vote out.  I mean if you enjoy spending your energy on infighting and purity tests while remaining the minority forever  Nancy is certainly eager to help you out.  You too can follow the California model.  Or maybe call it the Roy Moore model   In this ONE case  I just want them to have to vote because so many republicans have shown their true colors lately and need to be voted out. Including Cruz  really.  Politics is a team sport played over a long term and won by people who think ten moves and ten years ahead.  It is not about fealty to one person  the bruised pride of that one person  or substituting bravado for an actual thought through plan.  So you get your loyalty vote  then what   What are steps two through ten   What are your plans for the 2030 election   I hope you  39 ve thought that far ahead  because I promise you the Democrats have.  In case you haven  39 t noticed  the republican party has made tons of lo9ng term mistakes as it is and Trump mad is not due to a bruised ego  it  39 s because he was legit cheated. Had they not taken advantage of covid to be able to send out ballots  he would have won by a large margin. Notice the economy is actually at PRE COVID numbers already. he was successful in every area.  Doesn  39 t change that he was right to question things  especially with having been through 4 years of the left lying.  Its not about right and wrong its what you can do about it.  She s really into this 25th amendment isn t she   Too bad she doesn t give a crap about the 1st or 2nd ones.  You really think they would wait till 23 to pull that card  I bet sooner.  I  39 d be surprised if Biden lasted six months.  If they wait she can get 10 years as president.  Otherwise he d already be out.  Wouldn  39 t that be something  removed ten days before even taking office.  Works with the year we  39 re having so far  If they wait until 2023  they may have a big surprise because the republicans may take back over in the House and senate.  You think the dems will cheat less now they are in power   Forget Repubs winning another election for the foreseeable future.  Now that they can do whatever they want they can adjust the rules and even break the rules as much as they want.  The R party is done unless the people do something drastic.  Part of me thinks that way and part thinks they will get such bad voting totals they won  39 t be able to overcome it with their tactics. Really annoying that ALL republicans didn  39 t go out and vote and realize how important those GA elections were.  Don t forget Repub voters aren t going to be enthusiastic for any future election to put back in office the Rinos and Repubs that turned their back on trump and passed the shitty stimulus bill.  After the way a lot of them are turning on Trump now there s no way they ll get support again.  I am just hoping they get motivated towards some primary opponents for them. But sadly most of the challengers will probably be the same way. In fact as time goes on  there will probably be more RINOs instead of less because of the liberal brainwashing of society.  Well. If Biden steps down  Harris can t be president because she wasn t born in the states from what I m told. It ll be Pelosi as president.  Born in Oakland to immigrant non citizen parents.  She is eligible.  God bless this nearly gave me a heart attack.  Yeah  plus I  39 m sure they would have found a way around it if she wasn  39 t eligible. They  39 re doing everything in their power to subvert the Constitution in all other ways.  Oh ok. But we still know who owns who in this group of usurpers.  Ob absolutely but Pelosi has scared me longer than I knew what politics were lol.  Legitimately the wicked with of the south i mean house.  She doesn  39 t have the authority to force Pence to invoke the 25th amendment... That  39 s effectively enforcing a coup  which is treasonous  The election was the coup.  It  39 s their coup  so it  39 s ok.   deleted   I say no deal.  Mean while everyone who isn  39 t hard into consertivism calls Wednesday a coup. Which I mean is so not even close to a coup. If it was a real coup attempt it would be bloodier than one government agent shooting an unarmed civi  it was a coup attempt. by congress.  I  39 ve heard Trump can block 25th Amendment removal pretty easily.  By writing down  quot I am still the president. quot  or something of similar difficulty . That said  Pelosi already tried another coup option   a href  https   www.independentsentinel.com lest we forget clintons chinagate scandal the worst in us history   https   www.independentsentinel.com lest we forget clintons chinagate scandal the worst in us history   a   it  39 s already a coup. in for a penny  in for a pound.  Pence  Okay  Mike  let  39 s vote on invoking the 25th amendment  Assuming any court would hear the evidence.  lol she is trying every method possible to force a coup without doing it herself. first the pentagon now the VP. wonder who is next in line  Well  she can ask. I don t think there s a constitutional issue there. Is saying that she ll move to impeach if he doesn t invoke it an issue  I m inclined to say no. She has the power to move forward with impeachment  so saying  If you don t do it  I will  isn t anything outside of her powers.   It s almost like she wants to trigger a civil war.  For the record  the purpose  and language  of the 25th amendment is to transfer executive power to the Vice President when the President is UNABLE to govern  NOT because some assholes got out of control loosely based on a speech from the President.  What the hell is she scared of that she can  39 t wait a few days   Her laptop was stolen during the alleged coup. Must be something really incriminating on it.  It looks like Pence got his offer of 30 silver pieces. Backstab Trump and dems will go softer on him for the potential presidency bid.   a href  https   m.youtube.com watch v sRotOC20jEs  https   m.youtube.com watch v sRotOC20jEs  a   If the insurrection act really has been invoked  it won  39 t be reported like this. It  39 s going to be a huge mess  and it  39 ll be everywhere.  I d assume they wouldn t want it known that it was being invoked   but your guess is as good as mine. It would explain the lefts sudden surge of lunacy trying to silence everything and remove trump with 10 days left.  It would  and it would be justified. I just want a better source is all  Yeah I hear ya... this video is way longer and talks about the same thing in much more detail.  I have no idea what to believe anymore though... but here it is if you  39 re interested   a href  https   www.youtube.com watch v kOPmA6m42no  https   www.youtube.com watch v kOPmA6m42no  a   The house neutered the president s ability to invoke the insurrection act as part of last summer s NDAA.

They are just days away from Biden being sworn in and can taste the pardons.  My thoughts exactly  she kicked it into overdrive after that laptop story came out. False hope I m sure but one could only hope this useless bitch gets what s coming.  Or...  em what   em   Whatever was on that computer that the white hats got during the capitol operation  she clearly is terrified of it.   Nancy should  39 ve been more worried about the 28th amendment and maybe we wouldn  39 t find ourselves in this mess.  The pendulum swings...  We  39 ve seen the low esteem in which the Democrats hold the Constitution but since when does the House have the authority to order the Vice President to do squat  She is one evil cow.  How vulgar and descriptive does reddit allow you to be  Asking for a friend.   deleted   Can confirm.  They want Trump impeached so he can t run again in 2024. Sure  Trump is out of office now. But now we have Biden and his policies. Let s see how much people REALLY like his Kamalas policies. 4 years of that shit and people are gonna be BEGGING for the trump economy to be back  Adding Puerto Rico and DC as states further cements their hold on power. Once done getting a republican more than 25  of a vote is unlikely. And of course there is already a bill ready to file to remove the electoral college. Hello communism.  Wait until he raises their taxes  the economy falls apart  and unemployment skyrockets.  The next few years are about guararnteed to be crazy in some way or another with those crazies running things. lol. I bet we start seeing dems in congress literally having mental breakdowns. They are so crazy now.  This woman prays not to God  but rather to Satan. With whom she conspires against our nation. Pence will not mobilize anything and activate nothing. Impeachment attempt will go nowhere.   As long as we prioritize our our jobs and income over our freedom.  Just stfu for like  5 minutes. Please.  Just a dry run to 25th amendment Sleepy Creepy. Not only do they get Kameka  the authoritarian crackpot as president  but they get to spew  country over party  until they re dying days.  I hope Pence tells her to shove it up her ass and stands with Trump.  soooo why is she stating some ultimatum bs threat to pence  if he says no  then what  she impeaches trump  again  and it goes to the senate where  unless they are fucking complete and total morons  would vote to deny it.... again   Are we sure senate would vote it down   If they vote to impeach him the party will 100  split. Granted  politicians are so removed from normal people i wouldnt be surprised if they did vote to  I kind of expect a few Republicans to switch sides. They have know that we will never vote for them again so a reasonable choice would be to flip.  Or what  Nan   She  39 ll make harsh comments of CNN  Who cares. She should outlaw poverty and suffering while she  39 s at it.  Trump needs to declare Martial law over this.  Trek that sack of wrinkley shit to suck a fat dick

Impeachment  with conviction in the senate  means he can t run in the future. They are  strong not  strong  going to tolerate that again.  He  39 s 74 years old  something tells me he  39 s not Churchill or Groger Cleveland.  Pelosi will be 81 in March.  em Bilk Back Better  em  Biden is 78 and is starting his first term  even while obviously senile. Trump is in much better physical and mental condition than both of them.  Amazing how quick this moves but it takes 8 months to get even close to any meaningful covid stuff  To anyone that thinks these people think about anyone but themselves  I ve got some magic beans to sell you.  What s the rush Nancy  Is a certain laptop scaring you  Is the thought of a 2024 Trump presidency scaring you  Are you trying to precede with another impeachment  which would revoke Trumps privilege of secret service protection to plan an assassination    removed   Pretty much this. You don  39 t want to see this but they keep pushing people to react strongly.  maybe she  39 s fantasizing about handing him off to Iran.  Her military coup attempt failed so now she wants to go the legal route  Although the 25th amendment has nothing to do with what they  39 re saying  so idk if I  39 d even call this the legal route  Didn  39 t Pence already say that he wouldn  39 t 25 Trump   CNN is reporting he hasn t  ruled it out    of course  CNN sucks.  I  39 m sure Mike Pence is calling CNN with constant updates on his train of thought...or they just made it up.   He probably said he can  39 t rule out what he hasn  39 t ever considered and they ran with it.  Sounds about right.  If only the Democrats gave half the effort to working for their people as they did to trying to remove Trump...  I would rather they waste their time on failing to remove Trump for two weeks than actually listen to  their people .  Same  but sadly  their voters voted for this kind of stuff. That s what happens when you base your voting decisions entirely off of  orange man bad.   That is a message conservatives should be screaming   An interesting way to approach this would be to think what would happen were the parties switched  dems are united in their hatred of America so they stick together
t3_kufw8j,Deja vu How Rome Destroyed Its Own Republic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kufw8j/deja_vu_how_rome_destroyed_its_own_republic/,No better time to know your history.  Timeless themes of individualism vs. collectivism  racial tensions  tribalism  money and power  censorship  indoctrination and propaganda  free speech vs.  quot proper quot  speech.    I think  this relatively peaceful period of  quot cruise control quot  we  39 ve been on in the US is coming to an end.  Easy times create weak people  weak people create hard times.  Hopefully we  39 ll see any coming hard times produce strong people.  Well  excuse me if I don  39 t want to be a Negative Nelson about it...  Hard times create strong people  strong people create easy times  If you take the life cycle of a civilisation to be  250 years  America  39 s would be 2026.  One of my history professors  mid 2000s  occasionally used the Rome comparison.  Most in the class pooh poohed the thought but I could see it.  I thoroughly enjoyed his courses.  I have a friend who  39 s extremely knowledgeable about history and we talk regularly.   If you visit Pompeii you ll very quickly realize how Roman people 2000 years ago are the same people we have today.  Full stop.  I always tell people the human experience has not changed because we live in Western civilization and in the 21st century.  It  39 s one of the man reasons I  39 m a conservative. The  quot old ways quot  are that for a reason most times. Humanity is vain and prideful. If we could learn to see that we  39 d be far better off.  Yeah it  39 s just not true that they were dumber back then. If anything they were smarter. You think math is hard  how hard would it be to come up with it yourself  People also think they were less civilized  and modern people are somehow of greater moral character.   I think they definitely were smarter than today s people.  I think people don t usually see these thing because 1  most have no interest in history 2  they ve heard the phrase  history repeats itself    It s not just Rome and the optimates and populares but the same inequality brought down the French Monarchy and led to the rise of Napoleon  then the Tsar and the Soviet Union. There are many other examples.  I think it  39 s too late too. Been watching it for years but haven  39 t had anyone to discuss it with. Most are too blind.  Richest country in the world  the majority  independents  republicans and democrats alike  can t even afford an emergency  400 bill let alone a middle class lifestyle. Add in the riots  the Capitol being overrun  out of control politicians oblivious as to how they look  throwing trillions at corporation but only wanting to give  600 to ordinary people  not even enough for a months rent   a fraudulent election  the censorship and the media covering up Bidens bribes from the CCP.  It  39 s how every revolution starts. I mean if we can only get people to not be so dumb as go who cares about history. Shit if our politicians and internal bodies could see it we could end most conflict. Shit half of it is over small groups that got separated many moons ago. Middle East is a shit show because we didn  39 t listen TE Lawrence and backstabbed who helped us.  Lol  yep     And he looked good for his age too   A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within.  History has shown democracy is fragile  short lived.  They had their version of welfare fraud too. Wealthy families who got onto the grain dole decades earlier when they were poor  but kept accepting it long after they  39 d become prosperous. Violent gangs like Antifa ran wild under Clodius and Milo. Pompey made use of them politically and then abandoned them when they were no longer useful.  Its as if humans are basically still humans  even 1600 2000 years later.  They have...they ve come in the form of ISIS  This was the worst article and explanation of the fall of the Roman Republic I have ever read. Honestly  it was downright juvenile. Like a 9th grade paper.  Yup and civilization rarely last more that 340 years  and that s if they are lucky. Where we at   Ottomans lasted longer  although their power was waning for the last century of their reign.  Interesting   Virtually every civilisation that lasted a long time didn  39 t do so because they were immune to the cycle of decay  but because the successor state was an internal faction that had many of the same aesthetics. There were still civil wars  revolutions  unrest  and political upheaval akin to a  quot fallen quot  civilisation.  True  it  39 s hard to define what constitutes a  quot fallen quot  civilization. Longest lasting state was probably the Byzantine Empire  but civil wars were practically their national sport. If we just look at a contiguous political state  the USA is already one of the oldest countries out there. My country of Canada only dates back to 1867. China  39 s current political order was born in 1949. People hate to admit it because America bad  but the US Constitution really is an exceptionally robust foundation for a state.  It is with cautious optimism that I say that the events of Wednesday and the draconian backlash from it with backfire. Echo chambers breed radicalization  and a large bureaucracy is incapable of quickly undoing events it sets in motion. They only ever have one play  and it is using force against people to force compliance.  Yeah. There goes the ACLU s Twitter account. I m joking but it also wouldn t surprise me even a little.  Decades of political instability led to a wealthy patrician  Augustus Caesar  funding turmoil in 27 BC in order to  save the Republic.     To be honest  this could be spun as Trump very easily. Not that I agree with that  but the article is vague enough that it can apply to both sides. Basically like a horoscope  I m sure when it was written it was intended to cast similarities between Augustus and Trump.   This exactly. It s a lot like the Handmaid s Tale. I started watching it a few weeks ago  because I was curious. Strangely  or not  I saw the parallels not with Trump but with progressives. Of course on the surface  due to the religiosity of the show  most jump to the conclusion that it s the  right  wing that wants that world. But the authoritarianism and complete control was much more in line with what we see from  progressives .  Unfortunately  the terms  quot conservative quot    quot liberal quot    quot progressive quot  etc. are all morphing into being a proper noun for certain groups with ever shifting ideals.  It  39 s because progressives pat themselves on the back for being so secular and different to those awful people in the TV show without realising that the way they cleave to progressivism is religious.  Trump hasn  39 t made any assaults on anyone  39 s constitutional  em liberty  em   although he has absolutely expressed desire intent to  quot bend quot  it  which is where he has gotten in a lot of hot water  to put it mildly .  Hyperbole  you get the drift tho   quot I AM THE SENATE  quot   Yea that is eerily similar to this last year. Democrats agitated the public and then told them is was Trump s fault.  Perhaps earlier in Rome  39 s history  the Gracchi brothers of the 2nd Century BC who attempted to stear Rome away from the mire of its own establishment swamp.  Kinda like RFK and JFK   Is that why JFK was assassinated    em  quot If they can whack a president  they can whack a president of a union quot   em   As someone above said  I view Trump as Tiberius Gracchus.  Hasn  39 t been murdered yet but most everything else fits.  He warned the corrupt establishment of what was happening and urge them to turn away from they  39 re dangerous course  which was primarily driven by self enrichment via cheap labor and foreign adventuring which while overall detrimental to a society is very beneficial to bulbous military officialdom and the military suppliers.  I think many are mischaracterizing Trump. He has done a lot of good policy wise  and his populism is genuine  but let  39 s not pretend he  39 s some prophetic messiah. These last days  and months  really  Trump has definitely been pushing the boundaries a bit too hard  and saying things that are blatantly just not true.  I severely doubt trump will ever murder anyone in the future  but yeah you re right about the comparison  Tiberius Gracchus was beaten to death by senators who were wielding table legs  Badass  On this topic please listen to Dan Carlin Hardcore Hiatory Addendum podcast number 2 where he and another Roman historian address this question head on.  Let  39 s not forget that the Roman republic fell to a Populist leader who took advantage of the poorest citizens to seize power. Not only that but one of the main reasons Caesar couldn  39 t give up power was because of all of his shady dealings that would have meant he would have been fully persecuted once he left office.   Similarities  Is Trump NOT giving up power    If he had the support of the military or even the majority of the American people it seems rather obvious trump wouldn  39 t be giving up power. He  39 s just giving it up because he has no other option.   There is more at work than  support of the people  because the people aren t in control  they just don t know it  All of the people I cited have become rich during public service  except for Hunter  who s done so by proximity to his father . Joe Biden has multiple questionable dealings  from the Bank Of Delaware loans to his involvement in Ukraine policy making when Hunter was raking in 50K a month as an energy exec. I could go further but frankly I m tired and this is not a debate forum. I really shouldn t have to explain this to a  Reagan Conservative   Ronald Reagan spoke often of the dangers of an intrusive government. If you want to debate  go to ask a conservative  while it still exists. Do your homework  I m not chatting with you or anything else.  What does any of that have to do the Roman republic empire  You do know that  39 s what you replied to right   I hate this drivel  em so much.  em   We can draw only the most superficial similarities between our situation and that of ancient Rome.    Well said you really hit the nail on the head.   removed   Yup  So who  39 s our modern day Augustus   To all agree. Great comment   We did base our republican system off the Roman s...  2000 years ago people didn  39 t have the technology that made them stupider...  this country is going to come back better than ever. we  39 re about to experience a renaissance  I hope you  39 re right. I honestly doubt it  but I would love to be proven wrong right now.  Yeah  we  39 ll be the first Socialist country that does it right   LMAO.  we  39 re never going to be a socialist country. you  39 re about to see the greatest show on Earth.  I wouldn t be so sure  I  39 m absolutely  100  positive of that fact.

I already consider Canada a TeRrOrIsT OrGaNiZaTiOn so hey sorry buddy  eh  Can Proud Boys sue the government   They can but justice is not delivered based on law the way it s written. Our kangaroo courts will pass judgments based on the laws of virtues   whatever the hell that might be. See Michael Flinn s case history for an example.  Do they even go to Canada   What exactly is the point of this   There is a Canadian arm of the proud boys.  Wtf the Proud Boys don t even exist in Canada. Funny how also Canada has yet to officially declare ISIS a terrorist organization  Well  Canada has been a pile of idiots for a while now  so whatever.  Like anyone takes what Canada says seriously  or listens to them to begin with.  You really should.  With the largest undefended border in the world  and the simple fact that the Canadian military is training Chinese soldiers on how we wage war... And Justin Trudeau admiring the Chinese dictatorship... yea... the US really REALLY needs to pay more attention to Canada.  I get it and not to sound arrogant  but with the   of gun owners in the US alone  I do not fear invasion. Add to that the fact that their military is puny  to say the least  when compared to the US. A quick internet search will display the many ways in which Canada is by far inferior to the US militarily.  so does this mean we can label canadians as terrorists too   Canada still belong to the UK

Everything good will be credited to Biden  Harris  and Obama...still.  Yep. The narrative will be  Trump led us into Covid...Biden led us out.   That might be an actual CNN headline.  Thanks  I threw up in my mouth...  Just preparing for the inevitable lol.  Easy  blame his staff  blame his voters. They will keep blaming the Nazis that only they can see  and in the process of doing so they will divide the nation to the point of breaking.  Obama spent 8 years blaming Bush for his failures  so I am guessing Biden and Harris are going to blame Trump  his administration  the Republicans  and white people.  Goddamn honkeys.  Spoiler alert   Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley apparently  If they blame Cruz instead of trump they instantly raise him to presidential   Fuck that. Nothing is my fault and you re racist for telling me to introspect     Blame the trump voters.  CEOs of any corporation that doesn  39 t toe the line.  It will be like Kungflu contact tracing.

The entire conservative base  as we ve already seen from the brilliant Democratic leadership who spent the better part of last year ignoring  justifying then kneeling   literally   to the actions of their radical base.   They will still blame him  but that  39 s normal  he still blamed Obama  Obama blamed bush  bush blamed Clinton.

Popular speech doesn  39 t need protection.  Yup. But the acou hadn  39 t been that bold  righteous organization for years  which is why I pulled my monthly donations to them many years back   when they refused to protect 2A rights.  Didn  39 t the ACLU fight for the NRA a few years back   They supported them only as a  quot non profit quot  because Cuomo was attacking other organizations  such as insurance companies  that do business with the NRA.  Ok thanks.  They also refused to take up a recent Virginia law that restricted gun purchases to anyone under the age of 21  because  studies show that people do not have a fully developed intellect to make such a dangerous purpose   paraphrasing   slightly .   Your paraphrasing was good. The article I posted says exactly that.  Long time ago.  They sold out on the 1A and 2A in favor of lefty good boy points.  They never sold out.  They were founded as the legal arm of Communist Party USA.  This isn  39 t their purpose.  They are worried about the pendulum swinging the other way and taking out the commies.  ACLU has always been the legal arm of Communist Party USA.  They just take token causes like this one to appear non partisan.  Leftists populists know they  39 re next when all the righties are purged.  It shouldn  39 t be a position of the right  should be a position off all Americans.  Democrats have no integrity though and their useful idiots agree without question  I was going to say the same thing.  Too little  too late from them. They used to defend free speech for everybody  including the right. Not so much as of late.  Yeah  it means a lot that the ACLU finally bolts out of the gate now that the race is over.  If free speech was so cherished  where were they when TD was banned   When Alex Jones was depersoned    The ACLU actually spoke out  admittedly weakly  when Alex Jones was depersoned  If it can happen to Jones it can happen to Pool  and Rogan  and eventually right back to the MSM.  The ACLU used to act in good faith to protect civil liberties for all  with the exception of the right to bear arms. Hopefully that will come back after their four year hiatus  Well Twitter now knows who to ban next  Here s the thing   Twitter was in serious trouble before the Trump era brought them all this attention.   Yeah I remember before 2016  Twitter was in a death spiral. Trump saved Twitter in some regards. He also just killed Twitter. Kind of ironic.  Wow you know things are bad when the ACLU is siding with us.  Free speech isn t  or shouldn t be an  us versus them  thing. The principle of free speech is for everyone  their stance is on the side of free speech  not  ours  since it exists outside of our flavor of politics.  This is what is so wild about the lefts position on this. They re literally destroying the Constitution  one amendment at a time.  This is direct cause of identity politics. When you define the world between good and bad  when you define yourself and all of your comrades as good  then when you have power  you can  39 t do no wrong. If you sometimes see some of your fellows doing something that you don  39 t understand  it just means that you are not good enough follower and have to work more to match their level of goodness.  Not just identify politics   our entire approach to corporatism has also done this  our default position of hands off capitalism allowed for a private tyranny to be created that has now silenced the President of the United States.   These are the fruits of postmodernism.  I thought 1A protects the supression of free speech by the government  not a private company   What happens when a private company decides to suppress the free speech of the government   Presumay also not a breach of 1A. The relationship only works one way I reckon.  I don  39 t know anything though...just guessing.  That is what the discussion is about now. Is it or is it not. We have become so reliant on social media and the internet in general. Also the tech industry has gotten so big that forming a competitor is kind of out the question.  It  39 s a question for a constitutional lawyer but I am pretty sure it is not. 1A protects individuals against the Gov  not the other way around.  I am not arguing from a legal standpoint. It s an ethics question. Is it right for big tech to do this  Legally it absolutely is.  This is what I was replying to  which is why I specifically talked about the constitution.  Yes  you re correct in general  but it gets very tricky when considering social media platforms  which clearly were not anticipated by the founding fathers of the US. For example  if you think of the social media site as a public square  then perhaps the 1A protections should still apply.    quot free speech quot  is more than just 1A  Neither is letting murderers and rapists out of jail  yet cest la vie   a href  https   patriotrising.com california sheriff refuses absurd order to release murderers and rapists due to pandemic   https   patriotrising.com california sheriff refuses absurd order to release murderers and rapists due to pandemic   a   This and the fact that Lefties who ve taken the side of the oligarchs keep saying the phrase  The first amendment prevents the government from obstructing speech  not private entities .   It  39 s also ex post facto law as there is no clearly defined parameters to abide by  Ask the ACLU if it  39 s ok to believe there are only two genders and then tell me if they are on the side of free speech.  This has nothing to do with them taking the side of free speech. But if they bitched about people believing they there are only two genders and got people deplatformed  it would be intellectually inconsistent  yes.   But they openly mock us on leftist subs for this very thing. JUST FOR VALUING FREE SPEECH.  ACLU is in an interesting organization at this point.  It feels like they are actually split between old and new guard.  The old guard cares about those free speech rights that they were built on.  But the new guard is the standard progressive talking point thoughts.  Since the ACLU is a collection of lots of different lawyers  they are split on what is important to defend.   quot what are you worried about If you did nothing wrong  quot    If someone says that  respond   Its not bothering people on  a href   r politics  r politics  a  or other subs who want to remove republicans conservatives from any public form of discourse period.  They believe everyone who voted for Trump to be a racist  Nazi  cultist.  So they celebrate this.  Add traitor and terrorist to that list now.  Got called those the other day.  They really didn  39 t like being called that  along with anti American   so now they see their opportunity to use it on conservatives.  Lol we are traitors for wanting to stick to our classic ideals while they want to change everything  This is a Generalization  I remember when this sub was a lesser know sub but the powers that be decided to quarantine everything or remove subs and funnel everything right of center into this sub. Not sure that is a good idea.  Coming from the side that couldn  39 t give two fucks about the USA remaining on top of the world.  I just respond to people like that by asking  When and where should I report for re education    While I find liberals very annoying  I don  39 t wish harm on them because ultimately it  39 s just personal opinions. But for some reason they think we need to be eliminated. We are the devil himself to them.  Realize most of these people are probably not American.  Brainwashing is easier without those pesky voices of reason.  ACLU twitter account now permanently banned for hate speech  Aaaannnnd now the ACLU is a racist organization  s  You laugh  but that  39 s happened with Charlottesville. They said something like  quot these people have garbage opinions but they have a right to speak them quot  then a bunch of people tried to start pulling donations and they backpedaled. Hopefully they stand their ground here  because this is way worse.  Kinda wonder at a dark level if there isn  39 t liberties to protect then there won  39 t be a point to having the aclu to start with and they  39 re starting to realize that the dark future means no funds  Warns...  How convenient for them to be concerned now our last check and balance is being impeached  There will be a conflict within the ACLU and their leaders will backtrack from this and say  hate speech isn t free speech    em Skokie v Illinois  em  disagrees.  Can the ACLU even show an instance where a left wing activist was ever banned for being a left wing activist   That seriously looks like the only reason they are concerned.  Tons of people laughing their asses off at Trump getting permabanned from the biggest social media platforms on the planet don  39 t realize what it really means  If these platforms have the power to  strong completely silence and censor the SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  strong   what the hell would stop them from coming after you and literally erasing your life when they inevitably find you guilty of a minor offence you unknowingly committed bc you  39 re not updated on the talking points of the day.  Wow the ACLU said something smart for once in the past 20 years  color me surprised.  The ACLeftyU defending Trump. God damn hell must of frozen over  Is the ACLU for or against free speech this time   Trump wasn  39 t the goal  he was the starting point.  The goal was always the people.  Trump was just the shield   em Twitter and Facebook have suspended the ACLU  39 s account indefinably for supporting violent content  em   That some in the US consider Facebook and Twitter  privately held technology corporations  some upheld bastions of free speech and democracy says a lot about the direction our country is headed. Free speech isn t free when your EULA literally grants your rights to the corporation.   Even before 2020  things were going that way. A  quot virtual town hall quot  allows a congressman from the west coast to hold communicate with his constituents from his office in DC without having to fly back and forth.  We should force PUBLICLY traded companies to obey free speech principles.  Important  If you are iPhone the way you stop Apple from deleting Parler from you phone is   What timeline is this  I  39 m starting to adopt communist like feelings towards corporations  Well now that the ACLU has said it  we can expect some people on the left to agree with what we  39 ve been saying the entire time.  The ACLU is an ally for free speech  always has been. Don t care about your personal feelings about them  they will protect 1A at all costs.   Always has been    Has their policy shifted or were those just internal memos discussing possibly changing their approach   Regardless if that s all you got  you got nothing.  We ll see if they say anything about Democrat run megacorps colluding to shut down Parler.  You ask  seriously  what the aclu is doing to not fight for the 1A. Somebody provides links  and you say  not good enough   C mon man   What   I never said that. Don t make shit up.  While true you did not use the exact words   quot Not good enough quot  any reasonable person would infer that it is what you meant when you said    Did you read the link   Because the reason link wasn t proof of anything. There was another link provided by someone else that actually had good info. I stand by my comment that the reason link wasn t anything at all. Before interjecting maybe check source material to see if it s worth defending   ACLU is no ally of free speech  at least not over the past 10 years. They  39 re busy labeling everyone right of center as Nazis  and doing everything thing they can to get them cancelled. They might be right on this one particular issue  but that doesn  39 t make up for what they  39 ve been doing.  What have they been doing  Serious question. I ve only known them as an ally to free speech  no matter how unpopular.   a href  https   www.heritage.org the constitution commentary the aclu loses its way  https   www.heritage.org the constitution commentary the aclu loses its way  a   Great links. Thank you. I didn t know they changed that much.  No they re not. They re a proponent for free speech that fits within their narrow window of what should be allowed. They re not gonna defend statements of  violence  from right wingers.  What non right wing major policy institutions are condemning this  Shit  many conservative orgs are being silent.  I mean... how many right wing major policy institutions even EXIST   Wow.  Pay closer attention... Aclu is about bringing in cash.  Not advocating for civil rights   Maybe way back  but in recent memory the ACLU tends to curve left.  And this is me being kind.  No they  39 re not. They used to be.  In the past this was true. Things have changed though and this is no longer always the case.  That is objectively false.  They had leaked memos about how they needed to   39 rethink  39  it  and just look at their response to Charlottesville.  They were at one time. Maybe they found their balls again.  A civil liberty is a civil liberty. I remember reading that they warned against the banning of tiktock for the same reason.  It would be cool if the ACLU cared about liberty  where have you been the last year  Bows a good time to course correct.  Lol so when they have censored everyone the ACLU hates  now its time to sound the alarm.  They probably realized that it hurts the left more than anyone else because they now don  39 t have a safe haven for trolling trump personally. The left can  39 t get by without having someone to bully  which is ironic since they claim to be the anti bully party.  Oh  so the ACLU is back on the free speech bandwagon now that Trump lost the election

This about the freedom of our entire country.  White supremacy is their boogeyman  they have to make sure the base is constantly afraid so they stay in line.  That is a disgustingly divisive and untrue thing to say.  She is the worst Speaker of the House we  39 ve ever had and a total embarrassment to our country.  Divisive is a leftist term.  It  39 s used correctly.  Identity politics are extremely divisive by nature.  When BLM or Antifa protests  Businesses are burned down and stores are vandalized.   They will NOT stop telling me how stupid I am for being a part of Trump  39 s cult.   Nailed it. I  39 ve gotten so many DM  39 s. Not ONE of them wanted to have an actual conversation. Just wanted to name call like little children.  I had a few awesome conversations with some DMs.  See  I wish just once someone would DM me and be normal and want to listen and actually have a convo. You  39 re lucky. I  39 m in Mass. A lot of my friends are liberals. We can talk about politics and be fine. Someone usually ends the convo with a funny kill shot and we  39 ll go back to whatever we were doing. The ones that hide behind their phone and are angry are just hopeless.  They literally said we would be hunted in the streets   Yeah he literally said that to me. Clearly a troll account  but nonetheless he still said it  Right. I was more shocked than anything.

Nothing surprises me anymore  but yet at the same time it all surprises me  Report him to the FBI  Of course she does   to democrats  everything is about race.  Martin Luther King would be ashamed of the Democratic Party.  What in the fuck does that even mean   Let this settle any doubt that today  39 s democrats are the most toxic and evil Americans since the 19th century Democrats.  Even with all her ill gotten money  she couldn  39 t even buy a clue  Biden won. Dems won the senate. Why are they still foaming at the mouth  They should be happy.   Four years of hatred filled echo chambers will create some angry people.   strong You have to be next level dumb to fall for all this.  strong   Said the white lady.  Hey Nancy  I just wanted to say that you re white.  Nancy Pelosi is a racist  It  39 s honestly funny that some people seriously go right along with their so obvious race baiting attempts and go around repeating it like it  39 s truth. Like anything had a thing to do with race. haha.  There is no democracy anymore amid the blatant election fraud committed by the DNC in both 2016 and 2020 so I guess they made a logical choice if they chose something over nothing.

By falsely using and projecting  the comparison first they prevent the actual comparison from being made and seen correctly  This is an embarrassing take by Schwarzenegger. It  39 s totally fine to condemn the violence from Wednesday but to compare it to the Nazis is extremely divisive  dishonest  and hyperbolic.

Arnold was a seriously shitty governor  second only to Newsom  He was never a republican either  Don  39 t like the US    Go back to making shitty movies  80s and 90s Arnold movies kicked ass.

They may be a communist dictatorship  but they are a strong ruthless one. Trump went at Jong Un hard at first  up in his face also dare  39 ing him to do something  and they ended up de escilating and coming to a mutual respect. We weren  39 t friends but also not enemies anymore either.         Can you imagine either of them meeting with foreign leaders. Joe  where s my pudding  Biden and Kamala  cackling  Harris  A double shit sandwich  First VP to juck  amp  jive.  Historic.  Dont forget she wants fweedom  Biden has to ask China first if he  39 s allowed to do something about it or even act like he  39 s going to do something about it.  This will get worse for sure. They know the Democrats are allies of communist China. While NK are bitter enemies of the CCP.          Well he doesnt have to ask.  He knows already that he is forbidden from interfering with North Korea in any way significant.   quot C  39 mon man  We gotta keep up appearances here   quot   Have I mentioned lately that I think we  39 re fucked six ways from Sunday   Still no WW3 with NOKO    This doesn  39 t concern me near as much as massive implosion that will happen in the middle east.  That s because he knows he s about to start getting fucked with again  Outside of the chattering class bubble  there was a suprising degree of support for Mr. Trump in the international community. His national security policy seemed to be one of strong restraint. No new wars but a willingness to project power if needed. So in the rest of the world  having a leader that one can craft deals with  as opposed to one on a never ending apology tour  meant an easing of international tensions. Now with Mr. Biden and his Obama era policy team that gave the world failed interventions in Syria and Libya  we are heading for  quot interesting times quot .  People always said Trump was sucking up to dictators and forget the reason behind it. If we re all mean and shit out of the gate why would Jong Un want to make a deal with us  If we rub his back a bit and build up his ego of course he s going to like us more. It was always the dumbest shit when people made those comments about Trump wanting to get along with dictators    Please be the bee...please be the bee ..fuck  Trump achieved world peace. And Biden is already ruining it.  that  39 s definitely going to make the public want a president Biden.  Biden will just say  Will you shut up  man   and leave it at that.  Just another reason Biden is totally unfit for office  he s internationally incompetent.  what a great time to be forced to sign up for the draft  a biden presidency.  There s a new sheriff in town ... errr sort of.  Could you imagine Kamala pulling the  quot excuse me Im speaking quot  on Kim   Yeah  he  39 s gonna be a bitch to Biden because Kim actually wanted to make a deal with Trump. The outline was that Trump lets Kim take over the South  but he  39 ll make the peninsula into a state akin to Sweden  take the US  39 s side in the fight against China  Elite NK officials hate China  the mantra that they teach their kids is the US is a 100 years  39  enemy but China is a 1000 years  39  enemy   and allow for US troops to be on the peninsula in exchange for also securing his rule and nukes. This would also be better for the Korean Peninsula as Moon Jae In also wants China to annex South Korea in exchange of him being a high tier official in the CCP.  It remains to be seen who is actually running the show.  We know it  39 s not Xiao or Kammie.   
t3_kveqhu,The Conservative Movement Needs an Amazon.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kveqhu/the_conservative_movement_needs_an_amazoncom/,That would be good but we d also need a conservative Stripe and PayPal  Also a source of goods that  39 s not made by slave labor in a communist country.  Why PayPal just out of interest I m completely ignorant about them  Anti gun for one  Conservative content creators got banned from patreon  crowdfunding site . So they moved to a patreon competitor  stripe and paypal both pulled out from the competitor.  Owned by China.  It s just all ridiculous. This is no different  in my opinion  than not providing services to someone because they are  black  gay  old  female  insert identity category here .  Dan Bongino has been preaching for 4 years now that we need a parallel economy to the current big dogs  for the very reasons we are seeing now. If there was ever a time for folks to put their money where their mouths and convictions are  now would definitely be the time. Though we should have been prepping for this in 2016.  The only issue I have is many conservatives aren t necessarily standing for or fighting for the freedoms in the constitution. Yes they love their 1st and 2nd but fall short on freedom of religion. It is just constant  God s Country  and Religious rhetoric. If they could focus on the freedoms and constitutional issues I d be all for it. Don t need a pop up every 5 minutes asking if I ve accepted Christ into my life and talking about the end days.  I too agree with not giving a flying fuck about religion and bible quotes typically mean someone doesn t have a leg to stand on  but what does this have to do with this ad   And it is an ad.  Just the fact that Conservatives on average are completely tech illiterate  and a Conservatives Amazon would likely turn into a  quot Christian quot  Amazon and likely be obnoxious lol.   That s a great point.  I went to 4chan twice and would never return. Right voter is never going to take off as an alternate to amazon. This dude is just trying to capitalize on republican tears for a quick minute. And good for him  he ll probably make 10 or 20k then shut down.   The Christian base was once extremely dominant but in my worthless opinion it  39 s a dying base. If you look at the voting demographics people registering as Christians has dropped significantly on both sides but a larger percentage of Republicans identify as Christians.   What basis do you have to assume most conservatives are tech illiterate and would likely turn a site into a Christian Amazon  I think your views of conservatives might need updating.  I mean I can only go off the data provided and personal life experience.  You mean like what we  39 re looking at in 9 days   You mean that end days   Well I mean it was the same thing when Obama took Office too. Granted I think this time is far more divisive  I am not convinced the world is going to end lol. I do believe we are headed in the opposite direction of what our Country was founded on  but I do have hope that we can come back. I think this is the result of both parties slowly eroding away at our rights for many years.  Cancel your prime membership. It is the only way to hurt them.  We need a lot.....and it  39 s just never going to happen.  We can  39 t even get and keep a Facebook alternative.  If we had an Amazon  it would never get off the ground. The mob would go after any company that wanted to do business with us.  Overstock.com  Wait they only sell shit my wife would buy. I guess it  39 s a start though  Lmao this comment caught me off guard for a laugh. Thanks.   Somebody crowdfund me.  I might sound like a commie here  but I disagree.      Nationalization is a step too far in my opinion  heavy regulation should be enough for the cases of Facebook  Amazon and Twitter. You  39 d just need the government to move faster and less 80 year olds stuck in the 70s.  Nationalizing never works.  It drives up prices and removes competition.  That  39 s probably true. I just wish there was some way to recognize the  quot necessities quot  in life  and have the government provide those. Otherwise whoever holds the monopoly can make the common citizens dance to their tune.  And that is exactly the reason anti monopoly laws exist.  So much good they did us   quot It  39 s not enough that Democrats have cultural control and market dominance over products we would like to use. We need to give them legal control over them too  quot

t3_ku5sj5,Amazon reportedly kicking Parler off its web hosting service,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku5sj5/amazon_reportedly_kicking_parler_off_its_web/,bUiLd y0Ur oWn s1tE  Also build your own webhosting service. And while you  39 re at it  build your own entire internet. Build your own alternate planet Earth  since we hate each other so much here that we can  39 t coexist even on the most basic terms.  I am studying for my AWS Cloud practitioner certification right now. Amazon competes voraciously to corner the cloud market. The idea that hosting with them is better for your business vs setting up your own server is part of their pitch  and they aggressively outcompete or buy out independent or smaller server farm companies.  I think the pitfall many free market capitalists fall into is that they promote their ideas in markets that aren  39 t actually free.   Well  in part government regulations which were well intentioned  but poorly implemented have allowed these systems to be setup  just like the travesty that is American insurance schemes.  This is why crises are such bad things   stuff is implemented without good thought and consideration first.  Thinking that the cloud provider market isn  39 t free  or has no competition  might be one of the most stupid hot takes I  39 ve seen in quite a while.  You should probably study harder. There are dozens of cloud providers capable of providing a website.  I don  39 t think he was trying to paint it as impossible but that very intentional hurdles are in place to ensure a growing market share for aws.  AWS isn  39 t creating hurdles  they just innovate faster and have a better api.  Mark my words  future browsers of this archived page.  You think you  39 re safe cuz you found your own galaxy   Well fire that warp drive back up  you  39 re gonna need your own supercluster soon...   quot That won  39 t radicalise you  quot   Site   webhost. Top level post already said that.   removed   AWS ought to uniformly apply the TOS.  Hello fellow conservative.   The TOS argument is obviously bullshit when the TOS bans any website with  offensive  content  which Amazon obviously does not enforce at all.  There are degrees of offensive. The posts AWS highlighted that Parler refused to remove seem to violate us laws in several cases.  You wrote this long essay and still dont know why these companies did this at the same time  Hint  it  39 s really not a about violence... it  39 s more about anti competition monopoly moolah anti trust. But orange bad man works so why not   This.  They are essentially functioning as a trust  which is actually a federal crime. Twitter  Facebook  Amazon  Apple  and Google could all be  em criminally  em  fined and sanctioned if they are convicted of forming an illegal trust. The courts could also break them up into seperate companies  just like Bell or  almost  Microsoft. Theoretically  executives could be criminally charged if they knowingly participated in the trust  though this is very rare in practice .   Because they were inciting violence at a time when violent protesters just stormed the capital  and there has been chatter about a January 17th attack   Why wasn t action taken anywhere when it was the leftist calling for  encouraging or defending violence   Dude wake up. What do companies care for the most  Let  39 s all say it together  M O N E Y. Trump was just a good excuse to crush competition. These companies are providing a  good reason to break them up. They will regret this dumb ass strategy.  Serious question  twitter and other platforms are a cesspool of disinformation and hate speech that regularly have users breaking TOS  yet these platforms never lose their hosting service. I would believe Parler has a moderation service aswell  but given the influx of users  the website most likely can  39 t delete every single TOS breaking post for erroneous conduct. Hell  who knows if half of the people utilizing said conduct aren  39 t just shills trying to get the platform banned  Consequently  why is Parler getting the short end of the stick  despite suffering from the exact same problems that facebook  twitter  reddit and others suffer   Twitter doesn  39 t have a hosting service  they run their own data centers. In the case of companies like this  their concern is with whatever mission ethics whatever else they  39 ve chosen to go with. Beyond that  it  39 s a business risk thing  they need to make sure that they are not violating US law and if their customers are  that they exercising a reasonable effort to prevent it.  Uh  dude we all know why Amazon did this. Has nothing to do with TOS violations.  Inciting violence is a crime. If Amazon is sending terms of service letters instead of reporting to the police  they are complicit in the crime... or just building their own justice system.  That is not how that works. A site can mitigate its liability by taking reasonable effort to prevent and remove illegal content.  All it takes is for credit card processing companies to start refusing services and it will basically shut down any business period point blank. That  39 s the real scary scenario here.  I  39 m expecting this. I don  39 t know how soon but it will happen.  They already started doing it to firearm companies. Cutting off their banking services. Operation Chokepoint. Also  banks have been targeting individual companies  closing their accounts and credit lines. PayPal refuses to do business with firearm companies. BoA has dropped firearm and firearm accessory manufacturers.  Isn  39 t this what Bitcoin was meant to facilitate    That s what credit card companies did to PornHub a few weeks ago for hosting a large amount of illegal content. They only accept cryptocurrencies now.   ....there are several  a href  https   www.vpnmentor.com blog best secure alternatives whatsapp   rel  nofollow  encrypted messaging services  a   This is the scariest thing that has happened in the past week. AWS which hosts almost 50  of all internet websites  now has the public  quot OK quot  to just turn off whatever they don  39 t want people to see on the internet.  AWS has a ton of federal services too  action should be taken to protect government information systems  Thank God the federal government doesn t commit acts of violence.   s  Those drones strikes in Pakistan and Afghanistan are peaceful protests. lol  Dont worry  the children that were turned into bits and pieces were peacefully disassembled.   em Fiery but mostly peaceful death showers  em   Obama is the Nobel peace prize winner with the highest kill count.  Similar to the gov partition  they recently started a china partition. It  39 s separate infrastructure  but no idea what sort of hoops they jumped through for that.  Ironically  Amazon hides behind Section 230 Protections to so they are only liable to pull down content that is illegal once it has been reported and verified.  This. NGOs are scary things. We almost need to deal with them like we deal with foreign powers.  This has nothing to do with section 230.  I hear what you  39 re saying  and they certainly can kick them off their platform. However  AWS hosts thousands of websites and online content and I can guarantee you that their are several left wing mediums that have also violated their TOS and have not been removed for it. When you make rules  but only selectively enforce them  they  39 re not really rules so much as window dressing to cover your discriminatory behavior towards those you don  39 t like.  They re arbitrarily enforcing their own terms of service.  Parler its not a piddly little website. Amazon is going to enforce their standards more strictly on larger and more visible sites. There  39 s nothing unusual or shady about this  it  39 s the reality of being an enormous cloud host.  Ha this is the point I was making but you said it better.  It really makes you think this is just the beginning.   deleted   It  39 s parents responsibilities what their children should and shouldn  39 t see on the internet  not big tech or government. Just my opinion.  It  39 s called a TOS  nearly every provider has one.  The TOS don t allow anything  offensive  to be hosted on AWS. I m not going to hold my breath waiting for them to actually enforce the TOS and remove every website with any offensive content  including Reddit.  This is unbelievable.  What  39 s next   ISP  39 s and colo facilities preventing them from providing a place for discussion   I really think this might be a wake up call for a lot of people who don  39 t believe what could happen. I really think these companies bit off more than even they can chew.  I might be wrong but we shall see.  Gab s server farm may not always be safe.  Water and Electricity next  They did this in LA during the early lockdowns. They were basically shutting off utilities for those who didn t comply.  Things would ve smoothed over in 6 months if this wouldn t have happened.  Lefties are praising Amazon for this decision not realizing the implications.  Stupid is as stupid does  A week ago I would ve doubted it but now I agree. The fact that Twitter  Facebook  Apple  and Amazon all made these decisions in a 24 hour window    Zuckerberg admitted Facebook and Twitter collude to censor people.  Now we just have proof all the big tech companies are colluding.  If you didn t know it was a cartel before. You do now.  It  39 s about class warfare. It would be very bad for the political class if your rank and file BLM and MAGA person figured out their problems have the same origin and that they essentially want the same things.  Personally  I was ready to write the incident at the Capitol off as extremists blowing off steam. Don  39 t get me wrong  that was still a violation of the American republic  but the idea that these corporations can work together to shut us down is enough to make me think twice. The People aren  39 t just going to bend over and take it. If they want us fighting mad  they got it  me included.  Yep. I think it was the wrong move to enter the capitol.  However the coordinated actions this past week by big tech and the D  39 s acting in concert are extremely  extremely scary.  This is literally kristalnacht happening in real time.  I don  39 t know where you  39 ve been the past few years if you think things have at any point been moving in the direction of  quot smoothing over quot . It  39 s erroneous to view this event as it  39 s own thing  where if it didn  39 t happen then things would be different.  Politicians managed to remove the Sword of Damocles from above their heads  we need to put it back  the Capitol riots almost did the trick  in the wrong way  but they do need to fear the people again.  I agree.  I feel like we are here because the left kept pushing and pushing us  and now we are pissed.  Censoring us will just piss us off more.   em  quot If you don  39 t like Twitter  39 s rules  then go make your own platform  quot   em  they said. Then when a new platform is made  the tyrannical censorship hungry Leftists want to destroy that too.   quot Well maybe if you chud bastards weren  39 t so hateful and stuck on your conspiracies  we wouldn  39 t have to ban you. quot   For 20 years now everyone has been told   39 not all Muslims are terrorists just because a few blew up some buildings  39 .  And you know what  that is 100  true.  The vast majority of Muslims are peace loving people.    When will they learn  that big tech does not care about politics  they just happened to come for conservatives first. They knew that the left would just let it happen. Do you really think these multi billion dollar companies care about Black Lives Matter  and the riot at the capitol  They care about money  power  and the recent rise in populism on the right scared them. These leftists celebrating do not know that they are going to be the next victims soon.  Just when you think it can  39 t get worse  they take it to a whole new level. The last 2 days is the tipping point of the death of free speach.  It can still get much worse. Just wait until they start pushing ISPs phone companies to people they deem  quot dangerous quot .  Wait until your bank drops you because some leftist organization put you on a  domestic terrorist  list.  This is a no brainer for anyone paying attention. Big tech is in the pocket of the DNC  and is their Social Media Platform.  You have it the wrong way.  The bans and removals are only asked by the left and only applied to the right. I am not ok with this  Why are the leaders of companies allowing employees to make  quot demands quot  like this  If you don  39 t like how I run my business  go work somewhere else. Good Lord.   Amazon might be easy for you to cut  but AWS is not easily replaceable.  It  39 s hard to switch  but if you wanted to  AWS  39  biggest competitor is... none other than Google Cloud.  You also have Microsoft Azure  Oracle Cloud  and Oracle  despite having pro Trump executives  owns TikTok who banned Trump   IBM Cloud  or Alibaba Cloud  Chinese .  To express yourself via the internet  you need to do it through a company.  Yep.  And Parler thinks they found another server  but how long will that last   The mob will go after them too.  Long term  the solution is probably a distributed topology. Something like Diaspora.  They might have luck with equinix  It takes 30 minutes to fire wayward employees and they will receive 2000 applications for the position within an hour of posting it. So if they  39 re allowing it its  because they agree with the employees. By making it sound like they are listening to employees they make it sound like they are internally democratic and they get some positive PR.  I find it hard to believe the employees at Amazon that aren  39 t allowed proper breaks are the that the ceo is saying they demand they remove them from the service.  It is not the blue collar workers at the distribution centers that made the demand  they probably have no idea Parlor is hosted on AWS . The demand quoted above came from Amazon Employees for Climate Justice  source    a href  https   twitter.com AMZNforClimate status 1347799256883552259 s 20  https   twitter.com AMZNforClimate status 1347799256883552259 s 20  a   . I would assume that group mostly consists of software developers  ux designers  program managers  and other degreed professionals  all of whom get paid very well and have good access to restrooms.   deleted   This isn  39 t about demands for removal. This is about doing things Democrats want because Democrats are about to have both branches of Congress and the presidency  and if they didn  39 t crack down on things like this Democrats would come down on them.  What do you use in place of Amazon   I currently use them a lot for supplies and they deliver quickly  but if you have good alternatives I ll take it.  My career has as lot to do with aws  and there  39 s no getting around that. Google and Microsoft are the only feasible alternatives.  I honestly don  39 t think there is a single thing on Amazon I get that I can  39 t get elsewhere. It  39 s all convince   I just got 3 1 oil delivered today because it was easier than going to a local hardware store. I won  39 t bore Reddit with my personal problems on why I couldn  39 t get to the store  but next time I  39 ll wait until I can.  Amazon was a godsend for me when it came to prominence.  I live independently  but I m also visually disabled and can t drive much.  Being able to have anything shipped to me fast is borderline required.    Well you can go to any other store. Costco  Walmart  Target  etc. They all provide online shopping and  quot free quot  shipping for a certain threshold. Not sure about speed of supplies  but Amazon is hit and miss on that as it is.  They  39 re making their big move. It  39 s the one sweep attempt to wipe conservatism off the planet by disenfranchising all conservative voices for good. I believe in free market principles but in absolutely no way does any of this constitute  quot free quot . A market that  39 s most free for the people is one that is regulated and restrained from not just anti competitive behavior  but infringing on the exercise of freedom by the American people.  My theory is that they want to socially isolate conservatives  in an already dark and isolated time  in order to push them to act out and fall into the trap of escalating rhetoric or making threats. People do irrational things when led to believe that they re cornered with no recourse.  The precedent this sets is bad.  Just remember that none of the  quot hate speech quot  or  quot calls for violence quot  is coming from the left. They can be as racist and violent as they like with zero concern about ever being banned deplatformed  the media will either ignore or downplay it. The left are authoritarians and they  39 ve controlled the media in a way that makes it hard to get that message out  I keep hoping people other than conservatives will begin to understand what  39 s happening and rebuke the anti free speech authoritarian left.  This is the scariest example of slippery slope imaginable.  I think a great question to be answered right now is when are Conservatives actually going to do something about these things  We can sit around here all day talking about how bad the Left has become and is  but that obviously won t do anything. For the past 20 years I m sure you could make an argument that it s been even longer than 20 years   the Establishment both Republican and Democrat have continuously trampled on our rights from the Patriot Act to today and we have not done anything to stop it. We all know that 99  of Congress are either corrupted or have no spine  so why don t we do anything. It s not like one day they re gonna wake up and say  oh  conservatives say we need to stop so I guess we ll stop .  Anyone who tries to tell me the left isint authouritarian is just declaring they are fucking stupid or all in favour of this kind of censorship.  Maybe we need to go really old fashion and mail letters and have conservative newspapers aggregating comments  like letters to the editors .  For now.  If we did that the left would find some excuse to read it because  we can t have those terrorists using the USPS to plan their violent insurrection   Just cancelled my Amazon music subscription. Fuck them.  Make sure you tell them why  I did.  Let us know how deezer works out  These leftists really don t want anyone to show them how bad their ideas are and how disastrous the results have been.  Because they can t win the battle of ideas  they ve decided to cheat and treat Parler differently than they re treating everyone else.   And with a Dem Congress and packed courts it will go nowhere.  They seem to have out thought the next moves.  They don t have packed courts  though. The GOP pushed thru hundreds of originalist federal judges over the last 4 years.   Packing the courts means congress with a simple majority can change the number of judges on appeals courts and the supreme court. Once they increase the number of seats  they load them up with judicial activists.  The two races in Georgia saw the GOP candidates recieving more votes than any GOP candidate  including presidents  in the history of Georgia besides Trump this year  and despite being a run off with no presidential candidates  they still got 87  of the votes Trump did this year as well .  Voting was made easy. Georgia implemented auto registration and mass mail in ballots.  Manchin has said he is against it. Even Biden said he is initially against it.  And when Manchin is offered to have his book sell 3 million copies he will flip. There is no way a single Democrat would be able to stop this.  That  39 s not what  quot packing the court quot  means.  They re agitating for some shit they ll live to regret.        Yeah at a certain point you  39 re threatening people  39 s livelihood. As if silencing wasn  39 t enough of a call to arms.  I don  39 t see how this isn  39 t an antitrust issue.   Sane left  Is that like jumbo shrimp   Military Intelligence.  Two words combined that can  39 t make sense.  Possibly  I  39 ve seen too much.  I  39 ve met a few sane leftists  surprisingly. They and I disagreed but we both respected each other  39 s differences in opinions.   This ends one way  Damn  shit  39 s about to get ugly really fast.  Planning on it.  Liberals who are here to troll  I need you to seriously take a day to think about this.  lol. Remember they claimed to be the party to  quot bring everyone together quot . I  39 m sure trying to take away half the country  39 s ability to speak will get them to like the libs more. And then all those conservative talk shows hosts and dems in congress who are using all of their time to condemn trump  who did nothing wrong  instead of condemning the ones whoa re overreacting. None of this was done to the liberal rioters.  Hey  if people can  39 t hear the other party publicly complain  the silent room sure sounds unified  right   This is such BS.   Nope. They are making the moves now. Elections are going to be leftist candidates that have a direct line to every single Americans notification bar VS the candidate conservative  that is banned and blocked from every technological avenue. And they will just tell the conservative candidate to make their own phones  and operating systems  web hosting services  apps  etc  like thats possible for even the richest of candidates. Democracy is in it  39 s death throes.  What a sad reality of what the internet has become.    This is what i was thinking 2024  39 s election will be like. Whoever the Republican candidate is will more than likely be banned and censored for pretended offenses making it hard for them to crowd fund and organize with their voting base. Big tech is already attacking independent political creators like sargon  dave cullen  amp  tim pool. It will be blantant big tech election interference. I  39 m calling it now if this censorship continues and it will we  39 ve already lost 2024.  Parler was warned many times that it should move from AWS before something like this could occur  but unfortunately they did not heed the warnings.  They fucked up.  They trusted Amazon to be an ethical company.  Can we have a peaceful divorce of states yet   We are China.  Calculated  collusion  we are watching the destruction of people like us.  Real talk  parler sucks. It  39 s like Facebook with no one I know  more politics  and very few hot chicks. I support the freedom but daymn it  39 s garbage  Well yeah  but like other social media sites  it was just in its beginning stages. It  39 s not like it has billions of dollars in funding  unlike Facebook or Twitter.  Stupid comment. Pretty much every platform sucks at first. I remember when Youtube was just a bunch of dumb cat videos.  The golden age.  Charlie bit my finger    Right  Let  39 s go back  No  they know a shitload of people are migrating to Parler.  Wrong. Every conservative voice is now there.   And memes. I  39 ll be honest I  39 ve not given a lot of time but 99  of it are related to politics  It used to be  but it was  1 on the app store when it was removed  and growing  em extremely  em  fast.  pretty sure now that apple  amazon and google have all collaborated to ban Parler  that  39 s conspiracy and collusion. it  39 s no longer just  quot they  39 re private and can serve anyone they want quot .  In the 1950 s the McCarthyrites were conservatives. Today we have the same type of actions taken by liberals. The sad thing is that the liberals are too blind to their own actions. They can t realize their own prejudices. They are today s witch hunters and they are too ignorant to realize it.  It s gone too far. This is too far.  This has some pretty significant net neutrality implications  It really has nothing to do with net neutrality. That was about paying isps for a fast lane. This is about hosting.   Net neutrality is the principle that every bit of data should be treated the same. The fast lane is only one part of that. If the data isn t even on the internet it doesn t matter how fast it can move from place to place.   Net neutrality is specifically about data speeds at the ISP level.  It has nothing to do with this  yeah  net neutrality was about the speed and cost of traffic.  this is about hosting  where you get to sit the website.  In fact  NN actually makes these websites more powerful.    That s not what net neutrality means  Build your own Amazon  This is straight fascisim.  But they literally have anti fascism as a member of their party  They can t be fascists     s  If I open a bar and say no fighting but you start a fight and kick you out  is that facism  These tech companies have rules and terms of service  if Parler doesn t want to follow them  they get kicked off  it s pretty straightforward.  The amount of hate messages I ve gotten from lurkers on this sub on this topic is staggering.  They re just going to label us all terrorists now because they will stretch the word  incite  and  coup  to mean anything they want.    It  39 s literally going to have the opposite effect that they want. We  39 ll end up with right wing and left wing social media companies  web servers  smartphones  credit companies  electricity companies  etc.  The left leadership doesn t know when they overplayed their hand since they don t have MSM pushing back on them.  This is a really good point that I didn  39 t think about.  If we had a more neutral media  they would at least get some pushback from those that can see the dangerous precedents being set.  But with a media that basically cheers on their every move  they feel like they have no bounds for their agenda.  Who is being cut off from every day life  Nobody needs Parler or Twitter or Reddit. Nobody needs social media  It s how a lot of people communicate  Ah yes  The Verge  the greatest non biased tech news site of our time.  s  My 2021 and beyond bingo card I created two months ago  Green New Deal will go through. Businesses everywhere destroyed. Communist  quot equality of outcome quot  critical race theory in every public school. No post Covid economic recovery if Joe models himself after Obama  39 s abysmal showing after 2008. Many wars. Kids still in cages since  omg  Obama built the damn cages.  del Compelled speech and even more flagrant Big Tech censorship.  del   So one of Parlor s executives said that once Amazon removes them from their servers that it might be down for a bit  but they have a bunch  of competitors that are competing to host them on their servers. Should be back up in a week.  I just canceled my Amazon Prime membership. I canceled Netflix months ago and terminated my Twitter account. Next I  39 m going to cancel my YouTube account and I have already stopped using Google nearly a year ago for searches in favor of DuckDuckGo.  It  39 s time we hold the left accountable to their own rules. Where was this hysteria when the murderous riots were happening   It is time for the antifa left and the right to find common ground. We know we will never agree on everything. That disagreement and different thoughts and ideas is how civilization advances. We should never get to the point where we can  39 t have a discussion.  Why isn t Reddit up in arms about this  Oh right  cause it s happening in the US.  Time to dump amazing  amp  use more eBay.   If we don t fight fire with fire  amp  use their cancel culture we will never win.  AWS isn t the only cloud computing platform  there are a good number of competitors. It will take considerable effort but I think Parler is not necessarily doomed.   em Reposting my comment from one of the other threads...  em   I  39 m pretty sure they use it 100   Out of curiosity  I was seeing what  a href  https   Gab.com  Gab.com  a   39 s hosting situation was. Seems they learned this lesson early on after getting booted from mutliple clouds  and finally bought their own infrastructure. That  39 s one heck of a money sink  but at least they can rest assured they  39 ve done as much as possible to insulate themselves from companies like Amazon.  That is a huge money sink. I can  39 t imagine building a scalable platform without cloud services.  if u are reading this  Become a parler member today  I just registered  took me 3 min.  I think what s important to keep in mind is the actual outcomes.  We believe in the free market because it results in superior outcomes to a command market.  We believe in free speech because it leads to an exchange of ideas.  Liberals don  39 t want an exchange of ideas.  They want it their way or the highway.  They don  39 t care what anybody else thinks.  If they don  39 t think explicitly like them and agree with everything they say  then they are the devil.  I mean I live in the Bay Area.  Try telling a liberal that maybe genders are biological you ll see some facism real quick.  There s a difference between being conservative and supporting conspiracy theories and domestic terrorists. True conservatives are not being censored  you can say all the conservative things you want. You can t say things that imply you will harm to government officials.  This is honestly what happens when corporations are allowed too much power. Those dystopian futures in all the sci fi media  That s whats coming  but china will be heading it all as supreme leader. The only thing that can fix the path we re going is action.

t3_ku3rdi,Apple is removing Parler from the App Store,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku3rdi/apple_is_removing_parler_from_the_app_store/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  rel  nofollow  https   discord.gg conservative  a   Next Amazon for the kill.  I wonder if they can find a new host. But hey we are all just conspiracy theorists right   Parler is getting cutoff AWS tomorrow at midnight. They say they hope to find a new host within a week.   quot You  39 re a conspiracy theorist if you seriously think google and apple are going to ban popular alternative social media because they have wrongthink quot    literally everyone on the internet  They re making some extreme moves for a guy who is supposedly out of office in 13 days.  It  39 s not the man it  39 s the movement that everyone is worried about. Including conservatives. The toothpaste got shot out of the tube  They will do anything but address populist concerns. Modern communications theory says good content will always find a platform.  It s crazy  as Twitter spouts shit like this on the daily. Fuck  they were organizing riots on Twitter during the BLM riots.  Yea I think both actions are despicable. The reality is the riots and looting associated with BLM and protests over the summer  were fixated on some court houses  federal property  and many  many small businesses who got burned out and looted. These fuckers said  quot hold my beer quot   raided the capitol building in which 5 people died including a capitol police officer. Not only did they raid the capitol  they did it to stop a constitutional electoral certification process  which was largely motivated by disinfo campaigns and of course the president himself. There  39 s really no equivalent for this in our history. You had half naked Qanon shamans and confederate flag wearers looting the building while our elected officials hid out in the basement. Seriously unique times  I really don  39 t think we should be downplaying what happened on this sub but hold the morons who organized this to full account.  I like this take a lot.  Basically they lost control of the beast. They spent so much energy creating a narrative so they could win  that they can  39 t easily put it back in the box.  Would take weeks to months to migrate to another host  depending on how deeply they rely on amazon services. Also I don  39 t know if any of the major hosts would take them. Azure GCP OCI IBM are all leftist.  Who host 4chan   Who hosts Pirate Bay   Pirate Bay.  Probably some small hosting platform overseas. But the requirements for something like 4chan are significantly smaller than something like parler.  Based on a quick google search it seems 4chan has about 4 times as many monthly unique users as Parlor.   Most controversial sites host themselves. Seems like that  39 s what Parler will have to do.  Probably some private ran abandoned bunker in Europe somewhere lol  They could capitalize by hosting the apps.  Not that easy to migrate this stuff.  I  39 m sure they can but the downtime is going to kill their business.  I think your forgetting their users have been mass censored everywhere else... ill wait and so will the majority instead of going back to the communist twatter  Absolutely. Waiting a week is not a big deal. I tried Twitter couple of times and nearly tore my hair out. Never again.  It grew back  right   There is also gab  which a lot of people are going to.  750  increase in users in 1 day.  Joined on Friday.  Gotta get used to the navigation and stuff.  their users have nowhere to go  Yeah ill wait.  You forget principles are involved here.  Where else am I gonna go  Twitter already banned me. I can wait it out.  Where  Literally I can  39 t think of a safe place online for conservatives  Gab  I guess.  I have yet to check it out.  What  39 s gab I looked on Google play didn  39 t see it  Gab was banned from the app stores years ago. You can get through it through your browser. They are pretty much fully independent and have a good shot at getting pretty big as Twitter and Facebook turn into liberal paradises.  Man I wish the supremacists would fuck off to their own forum sites. A lot of the shit normal  non racist conservatives get is because of these fuckers and their rhetoric.  Seriously  a lot of people hear  quot conservative quot  and automatically think  quot racist quot  anymore.  By design.  Welcome to the internet. You either get full legal speech  or you get full on lefty censorship. Those are pretty much the options right now  sadly.  It is really sad while I agree free speech including hate speech is protected. I just got uneasy about the idea of joining that but it seems to be the only safe haven at the moment.  I  39 d love some rich republicans to buy up the majority of twitter shares and then fire Jack Dorsey and censor all Democrats. The outrage would be comical as hell.  Is there still rich Republicans   I hear democrats complain about  Tax the rich  them but all I see are rich liberals like Bezos  Gates  ect.  Yes  there are plenty of rich conservatives  Republicans  whatever . They just don t want to get cancelled.    That s one of the only ways to fuck with them.  Unlikely. If it s the only place they have they ll go there.  Probably Oracle  Bingo. Hit them with Antitrust.  The swamp would rather take a payout.  But with all the glitches  An antitrust lawsuit would be appropriate  but it will be a cold day in Hades before a Democrat controlled Justice Dept. ever lets that see the light of day.  I don  39 t know  I think the Democrats know it  39 ll eventually come for them too when they stand in big techs way of world domination. Big tech just help them undermine the president  and if they do antitrust now they  39 ll do it on a high note  Antitrust is not applicable here  there is no evidence they coordinated.   You know  these are public companies. What is their answer to shareholders when these actions affect their stock prices   I  39 m still waiting for the apology from Gillette.  So why can t Parler host its own servers   Because that takes significant infrastructure that isn t available  Don  39 t like Twitter  Make an alternative. That worked out.  glad we can put that nonsense to bed now that we have proof of how it will be destroyed by it  39 s competitors.  Nah they  39 re going to keep claiming that. They  39 re going to keep ridiculing conservatives. They  39 re going to keep excluding and banning them.  When Antitrust laws don  39 t apply to one political side  what do we have left to rely on    Don t you just mean laws in general   I m seeing a pattern well beyond anti trust law.  I agree. When we elect individuals and entrust in them the power to represent us and the laws of the land . . And the choose deliberately not to  what s left of the trust we place in them   I understand the frustration  but how is it conservative to force companies to do business with those they don t want to do business with   Because Google is 90  utility and 10  private company at this point.  And since they offer TV  phone  and internet services...  I don  39 t think it  39 s a conservative or liberal talking point to be able to recognize when a company is so culturally prolific that it crosses into utility territory.     Not gonna lie  when some of the fringe guys were yelling this kind of stuff a few years back  I thought they were bat shit crazy. Now here we are...  Thats pretty much how it always starts.  It s happened with basically everything.   deleted   Imagine a world where McCarthy and Alex Jones we  39 re right. Bizarre  Alex Jones was right       Google and Amazon control major DNSes  if they wanted to  they could block replication and effectively silence it for anyone using their services.  Google is going to start blocking websites in Chrome in the next few years. Guarantee it. Apple will block websites in Safari as well.  Use Firefox. Use duckduckgo.  Firefox is as bad in virtue signaling...  Switch to cloudfare  1.1.1.1  They re a private company guys  Don t like it  Just build your own network infrastructure  your own phone hardware  your own data warehouses  your own OS and your own platform  if you want to discuss conservative ideas    Hey kids  let s build a power grid and start our own sovereign state     em mumbles something about Texas  em   I remember that Portlandia episode  Just build your own government  LOL  Probably the easiest option so far  They only own 99.9  of the phone market along with Google.  Jeez just use something else.  It  39 s a free market system.   deleted   Honestly it  39 s terrifying. I guess we  39 re just not human and as such we don  39 t deserve a place to converse or share conservative ideas. This sub will be banned too I  39 m sure. And then there will be no where left to go. I wonder how long it will be before all conservatives end up on lists and have our credit revoked  or can  39 t get a loan from a bank. Meanwhile  I  39 m sure there are many left leaning redditors reading this with pure joy hoping that day comes soon. It  39 s just sad...  They  39 re already talking about blacklisting anybody who worked for Trump  39 s campaign or administration. It  39 s gross as hell but people seem fine with it  Even if they did that  they still need the public IP addresses and DNS registration to operate.  There  39 s one step before that   they can go after whoever provides network to the new Parlor site. Lets say they put up their servers in a colo that has level3 as the backbone provider. They then get level3 to boot them.  If that doesn  39 t work  I  39 m sure theres some clause in the peering agreement that they can cut off level3 or charge them more  or something else that makes it not worth their while. Whatever Parlor pays their colo won  39 t be worth it.  And what will you say  when its your thought being policed  You openly allow a private company to control your speech  do you truly believe one day it wont be your speech they control    The parent comment was clearly sarcasm  The sad reality is that the popular sentiment is constantly shifted towards whatever the manipulators desire. What seems normal today will be pushed to the fringe in 20 years  then silenced for being a conspiracy theory or extreme. We  39 re starting with the  quot far right  quot  then it  39 ll be the moderate conservatives. Once they  39 re silenced  the moderate liberals will be under duress because extreme leftism will be pushed so heavily by schools  media  and social networks. By the end  it will all be extreme leftism as the whole tower crumbles under the weight of its own absurdity.  No  just go open source code. It takes time to make a social media site. The easier it is  the more you don  39 t have control.  Isn  39 t Facebook and twitter responsible for basically every single riot after an incident like George Floyd  39 s  Like there are so people who watch the video on Twitter or Facebook and quickly comment that they need to take to the streets and riot and burn and loot shit. Flash mobs stealing stuff etc. How is that not inciting violence every time it occurs  It  39 s not like people are waiting until the 6oclock news to see the video and then going out. They are not monitoring their platforms either.  Shawn King must have made 20 posts on Instagram the night Mpls burned  telling anyone living within a 5 hour radius to drive there and burn the city down. Over a 3 day period. Never censored.  That was a pRoTeSt. Get it right.   S   It s ok  when they do it.  Yes.  And before  too.   quot it  39 s a private company.  They can do what they want. quot   And bakers should be able to refuse to bake wedding cakes for weddings they disagree with.  So I have a question. I was arguing how it was terrible   but not illegal  that Twitter banned Trump  Parler removed off app store.  I don  39 t know why this would be a double standard if you aren  39 t arguing either is illegal anyway  but Twitter receives government protections and is treated as a platform  and now companies are engaging in monopolistic practices to ban all their competitors. Imagine that cake business controlled all the cakes  dictated how people eat their cakes  and colluded with other companies to make sure their competitors were silenced  that  39 s roughly what you have here.  Thank you. That  39 s a good answer and similar to what I had said. I also don  39 t really believe you can compare media to any other business  The baker issue ultimately came down to 1st amendment rights and the government imposing requirements on the baker. The baker s decorative work  and the baking itself  is an art  and he was commissioned to create art that he disagreed with. I believe the government s imposition of fines was determined to be a violation of the baker s 1AD rights.  The government hasn t  yet  told Apple Google Parler how to run their platforms  though I could see a potential for anti trust issues with Apple  amp  Google  given their exclusive control of their devices  app stores.  Oh  but they have of sorts  Except on Android you can install your own APKs outside of the Play Store and can install 3rd party stores like F Droid.  What do believe yourslef.  It s a bit more nuanced than a simple yes no answer. If the baker had a standard wedding cake that had all of the writing and decorations on it for someone to come in and buy off the shelf  he should not be able to refuse to sell that non custom cake to someone he disagrees with. In this case  the baker refused to customize a cake with specific language for a wedding because it would have violated his religion  but he did offer to bake a cake without those specific decorations. I believe it was his right to refuse to perform those specific customizations.  I know a few super religious people  and they basically have the same feelings you just laid out.  To me it sounds like how I  39 d personally describe the difference between a customer and a client.    It s different. They make the cake thing more simple than it is.   a href  https   mobile.twitter.com jack status 1037399105306324993 lang en  They even consider themselves a public square  a     perfect demonstration of hypocrisy  That  39 s not what that was about  and saying shit like that further spreads fake news. The baker refused to make a SPECIFIC cake for the gay wedding  but was happy to make a different or generic cake for the same event.  Is that not his right as a business owner   He didn t say say it wasn t. They were clarifying it wasn t because of the type of wedding  but the type of cake.  Ah I understand what you mean. It wasn t because of the gay wedding  it was because of the gay cake.  Yeah. The baker says he  39 s also refused to make porn themed cakes as well.  More accurately  the baker refused to make a unique work of art that disagreed with his personal values. He didn  39 t refuse service outright  he refused that specific service. Which the SCOTUS should  39 ve ruled on.   This is a pretty disingenuous argument  as the clear implication is  quot They can do what they want  em as long as it  39 s legal  em  quot .  We need pied piper   Why didn  39 t anyone ever develop that. This internet sucks   a href  https   en.wikipedia.org wiki InterPlanetary File System  https   en.wikipedia.org wiki InterPlanetary File System  a   The precendent this sets is terrifying. AOC  39 S call for lists of Trump supporters doesn  39 t seem so far off now.   And now  Im receiving hate filled PMs saying I deserve to be black balled.   I got 6 8 of them yesterday with the suicide hotline   included. I  39 ve gotten 6 8 messages in my last 5  em years  em  using Reddit. Definitely some hate spreading around.  I saw people on  a href   r wholesomememes   r wholesomememes  a  support genocide of conservatives.  Ironic  Yep. It s okay for Kathy Griffin to tweet herself holding a severed head of trump  but Parler is inciting violence.    deleted   Nazis used the census to hunt down Jews.  Unreal.   There  39 s open source phones. Especially the ones built around linux. Or you can flash your own flavor of android on your existing phone.  I already don  39 t buy Apple products  but just FYI  at least on Android you can download the app APK and install it on the phone directly without going through Google Play at all. In fact  when Parler got removed from the Google Play Store they just put the APK up on their website to download.  Check out  a href  https   puri.sm  Purism  a . They make their own hardware  phones  laptops  CPUs  that runs on open source linux software  And here I thought iPhones were expensive.  They know they have us all by the balls. And they re loving the power it s giving them.  Everyday I get closer to  damn I wish I was born in 1870  even tho I enjoy not working insane hours and antibiotics and other modern luxuries bc this big tech stuff is just driving me insane  Amazon dropping Parler from AWS is worse. Even with the app delisted from Google Play and the App Store  you can access it from the web. If Amazon pulls the plug it won t be accessible until they find a new host which might not even be possible.  Maybe another cloud provider willing to take the flak for hosting then will pick it up shortly. Really doubt anyone  39 s willing to take the negative PR sadly.   AZURE GCP  Oracle  Alibaba all have similar service.  Lol GL going with msft or Google.  It s not that easy. There is probably code written specifically for AWS that would need considerable effort to migrate to any of the other platforms. This isn t a gut punch that just requires you to catch your breath. This is a blast to a vital organ that will require major surgery with a low survival chance. And that s If any of the other platforms would even allow them to.  All of this would have sounded absurd just a couple years ago. While this next statement sounds absurd now  it probably won t in a year. They re focusing on content and app providers now  but I bet that the next shoe to drop is that they will start to control users. It will be something like you void your warranty if you have apps or if you access content that isn t approved by them  em because security risks potentially compromise your hardware  em  or some bullshit like that. Not only will you void your warranty but you won t have access to the App Store at all. Maybe they blacklist you and won t even sell you a phone. If you don t comply with their values  you don t get to participate in modern technology.  I remember reading a Bible passage about a  quot future quot  event in which a world leader demands everyone get a mark to show their allegiance to the one world government  and no one would be able to buy or sell anything unless they had the mark.  The left right now  I know we told you to make an app instead of using Twitter but you were not supposed to actually do it  Fine  we  39 ll build our own server  with blackjack and hookers   Big Tech expediting a conservative purge is a positive  not a negative.  I  39 d rather see the band aid get ripped off than a slow bleed out.  A civil war isn  39 t likely  thankfully   but this is one layer below  where conservatives are forced to build their own alternative media landscape.  It  39 s the only way to compete with the leftist monopolies that all of us  regardless of political association  so frequently use.  You are right. We have to build a kick ass system to compete.  Is there a non totalitarian phone company that doesn t use slave labor to make its devices  Been looking for a new phone anyway.  Slave labor is the key to making all electronics.  So you are out of luck there  Well looks like it s time to get good at calligraphy   a href  https   www.pine64.org pinephone   https   www.pine64.org pinephone   a   This isn t a small fringe group. There s 100m or more conservatives republicans in this country. How long are we expected to sit back and be slapped around by big tech   this is not a call for violence this is a statement on censorship and inequality.   start by deleting your fb accounts.  And twitter and Instagram  I ve been seeing  But Twitter  etc etc is a private company so it is illegal for them to do that .   Their examples are horseshit too. Saw someone say  if you yell  fire  in Walmart they ll kick you out and deny you business.  Technically true  but is Walmart only going to kick out certain fire yellers or all fire yellers  Are some fire yellers entitled to more leniency because of their race  religion  political preference  sexuality  etc    I know  it  39 s a private company and they can do what they want. This isn  39 t a legal first amendment issue  but it is a cultural one. Not too long ago we as American  39 s had a culture of being proud of our rights. The ACLU of the past defended objectively terrible things  but they were right to do so because those terrible things had the right to be. We as a nation have moved away from this  and it  39 s truly sad. The answer to  quot bad quot  speech in my opinion should always be more speech  not less.  They seek to kill off all online conservative speech until the only views are those from the left.  Apple has become rotten to the core.  I see what you did there  They  39 re all creating something they can  39 t control here. I remember that all the shit hit the fan in 2016 when the liberals thought their   39 conquest  39  over the conservatives was complete in Obama  39 s final year...then Trump steamrolled the lot of them.   Why would Apple  Amazon  or Facebook support free speech when our own government doesn t   Not gonna lie tho Parler sucks I get it s a censorship free platform. But it s just an echo chamber and what you see in the first 5 posts is just repeated over and over again by different voices also most prominent creators don t run their own account it s just their social media team  All because Parler allows free speech  just like Facebook used to do  Wow...  They never cared about free speech. Just their speech.   removed   Well   yesterday I made a Parler account. Never had any intent until they banned the orange godking. But I guess they forced my hand  Didn  39 t we just find out that Apple knowingly utilized child labor in China  My god the arrogance of these companies. The people who knowingly use child labor want to tell other adults what ideas they can and can  39 t hear. If Lebron were a corporation.  Someone has to file some antrust lawsuit on this.   Build your own  It s Orwellian censorship at this stage considering both Google and Apple have browsers on their devices.  This is how radicals are created. They ve been doing it for 4 years and will do it for 4 more. This has no positive ending   parallel societies and constant conflict. And the Left cheers them on...  Flood apple with complaints. I already sent them an email through their support website. Used the  get support  button in the App Store and called them out for their assault on free speech. The more people who do this  the better.  Tim Cook s email is  a href  mailto tcook apple.com  tcook apple.com  a   Email sent. Thanks   Steve Jobs  39  email is sjobs a  oh wait  basically people want to act like conservatives don t exist  The actions of Liberals by censoring Conservatives makes them exactly what our founding fathers created our country to escape.  This censorship is not only Anti American but also treason.  It  39 s treason because it goes against the very fabric of what it means to be American.    Burning books is fun and keeps you warm.  They won  39 t realize what they  39 ve done until it is way too late.  The leftist attack on first amendment has begun...  The riot was appalling and wrong  but this heavy handed silencing of conservative voices and view points is equally wrong and dangerous.  Where were Apple  Amazon  Google  Facebook   amp  Twitter when the BLM riots went on for the last 8 months   Most were openly encouraging the violence and no one calling for violence on the left was silenced.  Right after this riot happened I was pissed at Trump  still am  but now I  39 m even more pissed at the authoritarian left pulling this bullshit and am doubting whether I want to be a part of their America. I  39 m center right  not someone way out on the fringes.  I accepted Biden  39 s victory back in early November  actually hope he  39 ll do a good job  but this shit is so unacceptable and scary that I seriously question the direction this country is heading in and whether people like myself are even going to be welcome in it.  Will this case make it to the Supreme Court and be a watershed to determine that Social media platforms and all technology companies that offer a platform of any kind are indeed akin to phone companies   I remember reading a comment during the election day mega thread asking if anyone was expecting a mass censorship of conservatives after the election and just laughed it off.  Selling my APL Monday  What is their reason   Wrongthink  Promoting violence. Honestly though  I downloaded the app yesterday when people were saying it was about to disappear and fully expected a Trump Cult hellhole  but honestly found it very neutral  Absolutely insane  I can only feel that this will make the tribe of the left buckle down on their attempt to place more rules on people socially and publicly  which will in turn fuel this extreme right even more because it s effectively proving to them what their conspiracies center around. This is a bad idea and the capital was the tip of the iceberg. Regardless whose president  the social issues in this country will only get worse. America had become tribalized into Trumpism and Wokeness. Any attempt to be in the middle seems to be met with annihilation.  A few private monopolies  accountable to no one  are shaping  regulating  and curating the discourse not only in the U.S. but around the world. This is absolutely unacceptable.  This isn  39 t disappointing news anymore. This isn  39 t a  quot oh well  it didn  39 t go my way but life will go on. quot  This is an attack on democracy and freedom. Censorship unlike ever seen in America before. Remember how democrats were angry that Trump stopped allowing CNN reporters in the newsroom  That was absolutely nothing compared to this  and they tried to make the former a case of infringing on free speech and freedom of the press. Where are they now  Cheering. I have absolutely no faith that any of these companies will see as much as one lawsuit regarding this because in a little over a week democrats will control the house  senate and presidency. The supreme court is literally our only hope at saving any semblance of free speech.

That spunds horrid. I am happy I live in North Carolina At least.  Bureaucrat Boris has been saying the NHS is at risk of being overrun since March. It hasn t even nearly happened  yet and most likely won t happen atall .

t3_kue1jo,OReilly argues Trumps failure to tamp down the angry protestorshas destroyed his legacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kue1jo/oreilly_argues_trumps_failure_to_tamp_down_the/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  https   discord.gg conservative  a   He  39 s not wrong. Pre covid trump  39 s legacy was looking like it might disprove all the lunatics in the media. Covid hurt his legacy  regardless of whether or not he was responsible. The capitol riots destroyed it. I don  39 t think he  quot incited an insurrection quot  but he did incite a protest that turned violent. That did destroy his legacy.  I don  39 t know  the economy was looking strong  and he probably would  39 ve won reelection. I  39 m sure Democrats would  39 ve still hated him but that was never going to change.  That doesn  39 t matter a bit. He had us running a great economy for 3 years  we hit a pandemic  he did a lot of things well and they ONLY talked about how he should have done better and he was fully ill prepared and only did things to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans. It didn  39 t matter.  I disagree. I think he would  39 ve won had covid never happened. His numbers with independents were solid.  Not to mention we wouldn  39 t have all this mass mail in voting BS. Putting aside the question of actual fraud  there  39 s no question at all that mail in voting skews things in favor of the left  because they have robust  corrupt urban political machines who can go round up thousands of voters  even if they  39 re homeless drug addicts who would never have voted in person. Just look at the Project Veritas video in Minneapolis.  For real does no one remember they just got done with the BS impeachment before Covid hit   I meant that the track record would be undeniable.  Yes it was. The media knew in their hearts Trump was a good president and their propaganda wasn t working. Then covid came and the lemmings followed the media.  That still stands  So like 100 people were waved into the capitol building by the cops and that destroyed his legacy  Okay I guess.  He  39 ll never be given credit for anything he did. The ironic thing is  under him we were closer to the world peace utopia they want than we  39 ve been in decades.  We will probably never be anywhere close again.   deleted   It did. His reputation now is tarnished by this. His carnival barker style helped him win the first election and many battles over legislation  but it was actual poison for this. He could have for example  repeatedly encouraged that crowd to be peaceful. That would have been easy and they probably would have listened. He didn  39 t and it blew up in his face.  I ve changed my stance on a lot of people over the past few years. But O Reilly has consistently been a piece of shit in my eyes... when I was a young dumbass who thought socialism was the way of the future  I thought he was trash. Now that I m older and lean to the right  I still think he s trash. Bravo  Bill... you re the most consistently garbage human being in media. Lol  Bill has always been self important and his goal has been to have an audience so he can be self important  If that is true then every democrat is responsible for the BLM riots and the thousands of injuries  dozens of deaths  and billions in damages.   Unlike Trump  they  em encouraged  em  violent riots. And not even in vague undertones that could be interpreted either way  I mean they openly and directly encouraged them.   removed   Lmao  we have to be strong  is encouraging violent riots  He also said they should be peaceful in the exact same speech  quit your bullshit.   quot We have to be strong quot . Wow  so much incitement. Advising Republicans to be strong is incitement. You  39 re either lying or straight stupid.   removed   It s easier that that  they are responsible for the current situation by exploiting what happened on Wednesday by throwing the country in a frenzy with lies  fear  hate and censorship. Every word from their mouths since then has been manufactured to destroy people and our country. Listen to their words  NOTHING Trump did or didn t do is even a factor in their rhetoric  it s beyond reality at this point. They just want everything destroyed so they can control us  The lefts gaslighting is beyond measure  To be honest   I credit Obama with the rise of BLM and their violent riots.

Piece of shit.  Unlike this idiot  Trump has held himself to high personal standards. We were robbed in the election and Trump is standing up for us. Anyone who criticizes Trump needs to discuss what he should have done instead. Just sitting there and taking it in the ass for all of us is not an option.  No swearing publicly as a rule no drinking or smoking or drugs . He was a poster child for good living  Stfu Bill. Do it live.   Check out my latest NY Times bestseller  Killing my Career    I m not an O Reilly fan. His ego is over the top  he s a shameless self promoter  the titles of his  Killing  books are distasteful  and his past sexual misadventures are tremendously off putting .   Bill trying to get that spot on CNN.  Weirdly  his approval rating went higher.  stfu you has been talking head   removed   Here here  Yeah ok.  Tamp down when and how   Yeah... no.  Bill O Reilly s failure to tamp down his penis destroyed his legacy.  Sad that even O  39 reilley going along with the elftist lies.  And hes right  There are many people that disagree with this leftist rhetoric. It will get worse before it gets better. We are in for a ride. The right is pissed off at the communist leftist trash stache bastards.  I wonder for how many protesters it was just about Trump  It seems like they want to put it all on Trump just to ignore the actions of all these other congressmen and senators. Take Trump out of the equation and I still think people would have cause to March  You are all idiots. Who posted this  Stop throwing Trump under the bus. A handful of idiots that were immediately denounced and told to go home don t destroy a legacy. The leftist media is destroying his legacy by burning the 1A and controlling the narrative.   It s not about Trump  it s about O reilly  turning.  That we can agree on.  Russeman has his approval numbers UP after Jan 6th.  Legacies don t work that way. What WILL destroy Trumps legacy is Biden and the Dems. They will try to undo everything  every policy  every bit of good that happened the last 4 years. If Trump did it  they will undo it
t3_kueznj,Greg Gutfield announces this is my last tweet has message for those who like the purge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kueznj/greg_gutfield_announces_this_is_my_last_tweet_has/,If you  39 re still on Twitter  get off. I deleted mine 3 or 4 years ago. It  39 s been toxic since the 2016 election.   Leaving Twitter and the leftist places that take our money   or make it from ads we generate by visits    IS winning the battle.  It  39 s 99.98  bots  Yesterday I was on the fence about deleting it  I had only just signed up a couple months ago to follow Trump  but since had found some other good conservative people and news sources to follow. This morning I decided to go through with deactivating my Twitter  only to find out I can t... gives me errors every time. Tweeted support a couple hours ago  only reply so far is other conservative with the same issue.  Just get banned  problem solved   Deactivated mine in October. Was tired of their bs but didn t see this great of a purge happening.  When I closed my account yesterday they told me I had the wrong password several times in a row  even though I know it was right. Finally it accepted my password but then said  error . At the 10th try  or so  it finally deactivated my account.  They  39 re probably stopping users from closing accounts. I had no troubles closing mine on Friday. I imagine the mass exodus that followed the Trump and allies ban has them shook.  I just deactivated mine just now. Took all of 3 seconds.  What kind of device do did you use Twitter on  I just restarted my pad and tried again  logged out and back in  used the same password to deactivate  says  oops  please try again later   On my phone but logged in on my laptop and deactivated.  Guess I should try it on a computer  might just be an issue with the mobile apps  Mine said  sorryToSeeYouLeave or something. I thought they were happy some people leave.  It is a common tactic by leftist corps trying to prevent user bleed after being little fascists.  Social media feeds of controversy  if there are no conservatives it will become boring and people will leave. The same reason why  a href   r politics   r politics  a  comes to this subreddit all the time  what is the point of engaging in conversations with people that think the same as you  It becomes boring  Twitter is already that way. Conservatives don  39 t use social media as much  Let them stay in their echo  get complacent  lose future elections. It will be sad though as they try to spread more and more social justice  but hopefully not every big org listens.  I wonder just how many users they have lost due to this   They don t care clearly.  Because Liberals are crazy and actually willing to support what they believe in. Conservatives lay down and accept what the master wants. I bet half the people here still have Amazon Prime because it  39 s  quot convenient quot   What are the conservative online retailers  I m trying to look for alternatives.  Find what you re looking for on Amazon and then go order it from the manufacturers website. A lot of places offer free shipping or cheap shipping. That s how I did all my Christmas shopping. I ordered nothing from amazon and it felt good  This sounds like more work   Did you have to track the packages   My point proven lol  I don  39 t deny it. I  39 ll do if I have to but it  39 s worth exploring more options even if they are slightly more convenient.  I personally had no issues  most packages arrived via UPS and companies emailed me the tracking info. Walmart I know has started selling some 3rd party products on their site  meaning they aren t liable if you aren t satisfied. Not sure about target. But as long as you verify it s Walmart or target actually selling it  and not 3rd party  should be fine. It s a little more work I suppose  but worth it to me. Honestly I ve found the quality of Amazon s products to be a bit lackluster of late clothing feels cheaply made  etc.  Good luck   Why should they  Now when they cleaned the user base  they are reopening for business with right values to start to bombard the  left overs with. We didn t lose leaving. We won.  I ve been trying to deactivate as well. My guess is they re keeping people from doing it in order to protect the stock price. Illegal.  Mine too.... Never used it but anything to screw their User numbers and hit them in the advertising pocket.  The only tweets I ll miss will be from Andy NGo.  That s interesting. I read somewhere Andy also identified some Antifa. Is it true   Agreed  I can t wait for his book to come out next month.  Whenever I see a leftist cheering for this sort of thing  I want them to read First They Came   None of these groups have been allied with Nazis.   It is mind blowing how people don t understand this.  Reddit  39 s general population are 12 year olds with zero world experience or education.  Also  Reddit is a small population in comparison to the millions of Americans that are out there. Think about it  we live in a country with 350 million people and only 150 million voted. That leaves at least another 100 million that didn t vote. The left are delusional  I agree  but I also think this hyperbole regarding the end of our country is also disingenuous. There s too many people that don t have any interest about what goes on because they don t see any effects outside of their local and state governments.  This happened with Chris D  39 Elia  he was very vocal about supporting BLM and white guilt stuff  then got decimated by the same mob  OMG. That is so true. Thank you for sharing this. I have saved this and will pass it on.   removed   Deactivated my account as well. Waiting for Trump to build his own platform.  Do you know of any good Gmail alternatives  I  39 m trying to decouple from Google as much as possible but so much is tied to my email account.  I don t.  I have been using Microsoft 365  iCloud  and DropBox all alongside Google solutions.  So it was easy to migrate.  Microsoft seems to be the only company not engaging  which makes sense since they had to face trust issues back in the 90s and 00s .  I m completely invested in iCloud for family photos and media  HomePods  Apple Music  Movies  Apple TVs  etc  and email.  I m selling my Amazon stock Monday.  It s a crap shoot right now  but I m not blindly giving any company my business or investment moving forward.  Hell  I m even seriously thinking about running for office.  I censored Twitter March 21  2006 by never creating a account the day it came online.   The best thing to do is ignore the MSM. Their social media. They will implode on each other if they have nobody to blame.  For the last four years we have heard the Dems claim we are in a constitutional crisis  now we are. I guess they were just a little early.  Never been on Twitter. Cancelled Facebook years ago because they were cancelling and dioxins conservatives  back then. Saw the same leftist basyards on all the other platforms too so never signed up. Signed up to Reddit because it seemed like the last place left but it too has been overrun. Parler shutdown. Not sure where else to go. This subreddit will probably be shutdown too.  Carrier Pigeons   Right     Guttfield to the Trump News Network  Yes please.  Overall  704 Following  1.6M Followers

The socialist princess who wears thousands of dollars in outfits for her photo shoots. I doubt even Imelda Marcos would have loaned this unhinged dolt any shoes.   quot but those aren  39 t important people quot   s  Will we be holding those who rioted  burnt down businesses  jumped on cars  harassed and attacked innocent bystanders over the summer accountable too    quot We Came Close to... Nearly Dying quot   They were potentially almost slightly dead  which is still a long way off from mostly dead.  Lol.   Lol. I can t with these people.  Remember these people are in power now.  I know  but I have to laugh because it is seriously just beyond insane that this is really what the country wants.  one of my best friends is a fan of hers and I  39 m just like.......why   removed    removed   She has never been upset about the murders  beatings  looting and burning during Summer of Love.  I love how people like AoC can say whatever they want  no matter how ridiculous and how damaging  yet she still has a job as a politician while Trump is up for warcrimes and impeachment   removed    removed   Right  it should open our eyes to how they think about us as peons.  I  39 m glad congress wasn  39 t in actual danger  but after all they  39 ve done to encourage riots all year  I  39 m not a bit upset that they were scared for a few minutes.  Oh don  39 t think they were not scared  they were that  39 s why there is such a backlash right now  it came to their cathedral and not some peon  39 s home.  That  39 s what I  39 m saying.  I do not regret their having to experience the fear they  39 ve left the rest of us to.  Why is it with the Left everybody is always dying  Are they really this dramatic   Scare tactics perpetrated by the blame stream media.  It s a contest  whoever s histrionics are most dire wins  What is this grammar  Came close to nearly dying  Why does that even mean. Nearly dying   not dying  came close   didn t actually get there. So in essence  they didn t get close to dying.   removed    removed    removed   Bartender  like to settle my tab.   deleted   As she ignores the China atrocities and will vote for China trade.  She is so melodramatic...with a straight face.  Putting aside the complete and obvious lie that is that statement...who protected you  AOC   Came close to something nearly happening  What   Lmao that part is already stupid. Let alone when you add not a single house member died. I don  39 t even think they were injured.  The more I hear from the Democrats  the more I am convinced we are headed for a civil war.  I honestly believe they are trying to incite a civil war.  In a time when they should be desperate to calm the population  they are pouring fuel on the fire.  I never thought I would see this happen in my lifetime  and here we are staring it dead in the face.  Best of luck everyone  we are going to need it.  How hyperbolic of her  Excause me  No members of congress came anywhere near stubbing their toes.  lol. what a moron.  Since she has been in office  all she has done is fake outrage at stuff and says ignorant things she had no understanding of over and over.  She actually made a video talking about her first term  quot accomplishments quot . It  39 s really sad. I won  39 t link her video but here  39 s an analysis of it.   AOC must be held accountable. Impeach the btch   removed   My eyes rolled so hard my testicles got sucked up and replaced them.  They were just looking for bread to feed their families.  Yes  Sandy  of course half of the house came close to dying. The half that was stuck in a closet having to listen to you screech.  Hahahahahahahahahaha wow. This is fucking pathetic  No we didn t  Yet they all somehow forgot all their many weapons and explosives at home...  Exaggerating a bit aren t we   So  wait  you  39 re saying people are dangerous  So  we should make sure to loosen gun restrictions so the rest of us can protect ourselves     Insert image of Trump thanos snap   Thats ridiculous. Nobody even had a weapon as far as I kno   removed   Ew...that  39 s a disgusting thought.
t3_kugsel,Months Ago Democrats Blocked a Resolution Condemning Mob Violence,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kugsel/months_ago_democrats_blocked_a_resolution/,Yup. Every single prominent Republican loudly and unequivocally condemned what happened in the Capitol building within hours. Need me one prominent Democrat who condemned anything that happened with BLM all of last year  Condemn  Shit the VP elect was calling for more violence and spearheading an effort to post bail for anyone arrested in the mob violence that plagued our cities after George Floyd. Cities released violent rapists  pedophiles and murderers back on to the streets in the name of covid. Looters were quoted as saying the looting was reparations. There are cities that renamed streets and public plazas after the mobs. Billions in property damage was responded to by saying they have insurance. The idea that Democrats care about the fundamental well being of our country was tossed out the window in a perfect storm this last year while everyone stood asside and watched the massive train wreck our country became.  When any particular party or group is against condemning violence  don  39 t equivocate when you get it. Violence is just that. But we wonder what their point is. Are you in favor of violence because certain groups are so good at it and you don  39 t want to speak up against them because you might lose a vote   Agree. Violence is violence. You don t get to pick and choose what violence is wrong and what violence is right. It s all wrong.  The left clearly has the ability to pick and choose  even support some violence  so long as it serves them.  And they get away with it because the msm covers up their hypocrisy.   quot By any means necessary quot  is their motto and shows they will engage in exactly what you described.  ThEy Ve bEeN cOnDeMiNg ThE ViOLeNcE fRoM tHe BeGiNNiNG  By calling trump hitler  and Maxine waters calling for anyone in the administration to be publicly harassed anywhere they go. Blm and antifa just did what they were told to do  remember they are just ideologies not actual organizations. It  39 s time patriotism and true Justice reform became and idea too.  They were all good with BLM and ANTIFA.  If the Congress is going to make a resolution about this  then Republicans should not support it unless it also condemns BLM riots.  Republicans should use their time to address the 6  months of leftist rioting violence destruction and demand that it be included. At the very least we would get to see Democrats refuse to condemn Antifa BLM and show their true colors even more.  Funny how politics always seems to swing around whether its the Supreme Court nominations or this

t3_kup8j2,Sen. Joe Manchin is open to statehood for D.C. Puerto Rico,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kup8j2/sen_joe_manchin_is_open_to_statehood_for_dc/,Of course he is. He was never going to be a wall against the democrats in the senate.  well he is a wall against the  2 000 checks  s  He  39 s a Democrat. Ie  he lied for power.  D.C. was created to be the nation s capitol. It is not supposed to be superseded by a governing state. As for Puerto Rico  there is an annual or semi annual vote to see if citizens want to pursue statehood. They ve had this vote ever since being picked up by the US...  And they don t want to   I don t even think PR would be that liberal give how religious it is  but DC should never become a state  If he refuses to eliminate filibuster  does that mean republicans can just filibuster the statehood bills   Yes. Who knows if he ll really refuse that though.  Yep  for everyone who thought he was our  quot friend quot .  We are well and truly f  39 d.  If Joe Manchin had any principles  he would not be a Democrat. Put a fork in us.  I m sure Murkowski and Romney are too. So it doesn t matter  Manchin is showing his true colors here.  If you actually think he  39 s a bulwark from the far left base of his party you  39 re a credulous rube.  This dude just doesn  39 t wanna get reelected  He s 73 I wouldn t want to be re elected either  Buckled already.  We are fucked.  Making these two territories states will be the end of the union.   Eh I suspect Puerto Rico could be much more of a swing state than people think  but to make DC a state would be nothing more than a blatant and evil power grab for democrats  How is this guy west virginias senator  Can  39 t they recall him  The population is red  they just elect this guy cause he built a reputation over decades  which he is about to destroy   DC won t happen and Puerto Rico has been stuck between half of Puerto Rican s wanting independence and the other half wanting to become a state.  Very few in Puerto Rico want independence. What most of those against statehood want is an enhanced version of the current territory status  Eh I m not too sure if PR would actually want to become a state in the first place... No matter how much the left floats the idea.  Pretty sure they are begging to get in  unless we stop them.  Which is funny because I thought the United States was a terrible country.  I wish we would just cut PR loose  grant them independence   They  being the government or the people though   That s misleading because the party that opposes statehood has been boycotting the referendums  So if everyone participated  the referendums would have failed   It feels they should either be independent or be represented  right   PR is very important for several reasons. The US has these territories for a reason.  Sure as long as Jefferson and Lincoln become states.  Don  39 t forget about Texas splitting into 5 states   Shocked I say. Just shocked.  The 52 states of America  Are we retarded

t3_kuij07,Article Of Impeachment Against Trump To Be Introduced Monday In House,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuij07/article_of_impeachment_against_trump_to_be/,McConnell already said this won  39 t make it to the Senate floor until January 19th when the Senate reconvenes.    Lol a political party can put together articles of impeachment within a week  but drags their feet on anything that may actually cause actual change.  BUT WHY IS PELOSI PANICKING    WHAT IS SHE AFRAID OF THAT SHEH AS TO REMOVE TRUMP SO FAST            Nothing.   It  39 s never  quot nothing quot   Ok  then simply wanting to force a vote for the senate. See who has the balls to oppose.   Its never that simple.  What are they going to impeach him for  He didn  39 t explicitly endorse the riots  and he explicitly called for peace while they were happening. You can argue that it was just for appearances  but it will be much harder to prove that in a trial. Also  refusing to officially concede isn  39 t illegal  and all of his attempts to nullify the results of the election were legally taken to courts.   What reason   That was already answered by the last Trump impeachment.  There doesn t have to be a valid reason anymore   the only thing that matters is how many in the House will vote for it.  Here is what I think the real reason really is   I ve always said they  the Democrats  have wanted revenge since Bill Clinton was impeached.  It  39 ll be abuse of power  which is what they do when they don  39 t have real charges.  They can  39 t prove actual sedition so they  39 ll say he abused his power by doing x  which is what they did last time.  They  39 re not concerned about actually having a reason to get him  they just want to do it.  Gotta make sure they twist that knife in the back for good measure.  Has nothing to do with Trump anymore. This is their attempt at a knife twist for the whole GOP. Big Tech is now licking Pelosi s taint. You watch  this is all about getting GOP congressmen on record. Anyone who votes against impeachment is going to be  cancelled . Social media will purge more  more woke companies will stop donations to anyone voting against it  etc.  You re not wrong  What  specifically  did he do to warrant impeachment  Tell the people storming the capitol to stop  At the worst he was inadequate  but impeachment can only be used in the event of  quot high crimes and misdemeanors. quot   So addressing COVID isn t a thing anymore   Not until Biden is sworn in  then it  39 ll be about investigating Trump.  BLM activist gets released from raiding Capitol and they want to impeach a Trump    Wtf   strong  em V  em   strong  is for...  Less than 20 days remaining in his presidency  and this is what our representatives focus on while the country is falling apart.  Dem and Rino Politicos  it ain  t over   2 years to next house elections.  While the democrats play partisan politics  people are dying and businesses are crumbling due to the pandemic.  I see this is how they  handle the pandemic .  Pathetic.

Nothing better than silencing people... it  39 s like they  39 re slowly making 1984 a reality  They absolutely love it and don  39 t even realize that if the President of the United States can be silenced then they can. And party loyalty won  39 t save them forever. They  39 re still not elites  they  39 re still targets and fodder. We are just in the way first and they  39 re fine with us being taken out first and subjugated. I hope sooner rather than later this comes home to them.  Why Anthem would do this is a mystery. Universal healthcare would effectively end the entire industry including their company.  The executives would be paid out once they close tho.  Dems policies would buy out exsisting infrastructure then put the framework in control of government agencies. Billionaires would be made overnight as politicians spend our money to fuck over our healthcare system. Remember that before the current administration took over the VA was guilty of letting patients die in waiting rooms because they were so poorly ran. That  39 s what we are in for under single payer healthcare.  I am pretty sure  they will figure out the way. Something like supplemental insurance.  Ah yes because so much health insurance is sold in the UK   So does this mean they will stop making laws that benefit these companies   If they were smart they would reach across the aisle to the average Joe on the left that had been saying corporate money ruined politics and say they are not getting corporate money anymore.   strong  em How come they never did that in 2016   em   strong   Good. They will easily make up the deficit with grassroot donations  by just advertising this withdrawal.  BOYCOTT  The list of companies that are considering this boycott is growing.  Boycott the boycotters.  It s the only way.
t3_kulpyo,Major Companies Begin Suspending Donations To Republicans Involved In Biden Certification Challenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kulpyo/major_companies_begin_suspending_donations_to/,Why do we allow corporate donations anyway   Everything that has gone on with this election should be a huge wake up call for election reform and campaign finance reform.  Because the congresscreatures who set those rules all receive large corporate donations   Good question.  Only donations to Democrats and only censorship of Republicans so Democrats can gain more and more control.   quot Hotel giant Marriott International  the health insurance network Blue Cross Blue Shield and bank holding company Commerce Bancshares  all told Popular Information  a political newsletter run by ThinkProgress founder and editor Judd Legum  that they will stop donating to any member of Congress who objected to the certification of the Electoral College vote.  quot    deleted   I think email snail mail campaigns could be as effective or a good supplement to boycotts.  Most of them are likely going along with this because their touchy feely marketing people are swayed by leftist noise on social media.  Make some directly targeted noise in their inboxes.  Guarantee they  39 ll pay attention.  So  they re going to go from almost nothing to actually nothing   Political persecution just like NAZIS did back in the day. It just shows how much unity emanates from their hearts.  Monero.

Trolls   It s always funny to see Hilary s team try to make her pop out of hiding to appear  woke  or something. She just comes off as bitter every time she speaks about Trump. There is no way to fix that image lol. Her comebacks are funny at times but it always comes off bitter regardless.  Nobody cares what Monica Lewinsky s boyfriends wife thinks.  This is the only way I will refer to this bitter hag from now on.  If Hilary runs again  the Republican party should have Monica Lewinsky as the primary candidate just for fun.  She lost and spent 4 yrs going How   Why   Like a crazy cat lady  Apparently she never got over the fact that America hates her.  Why won t she just go away.

He said that it  39 s not necessarily what you said  it  39 s what the people who heard you talk interpreted your words to be.  If this becomes the norm  then politics is going to become an impossible slog.  It  39 s just outrage culture permeating into the highest level of politics  And as the left continues to step on the constitution and bill of rights  the 80 million voters that are pushing for censorship of Republicans will have their right taken too. Out of those 80 million supposed voters I wonder how many think that in Marxism they will be considered the elite along with zuckerberg and pelosi    removed   11 people died during one blm  quot peaceful protest quot  i didnt hear a single word about it mate...    then how about the right wing is full of nazis  white supremacists  that the police are acting like stormtroopers  that mitch McConnell is killing you by denying healthcare. that trump is a fascist. that tulsi gabbard is a russian asset.  No  that  39 s different. Because....  Words do matter. Kamala said the riots needed to continue after the election  and now the left is mad because they did continue but not the ones they wanted.  Every single person who gets arrested or questioned over why they went into the Capitol needs to say  Because Kamala Harris told me that we needed to riot and continue rioting after the election to see change.   I m just glad you aren t the one writing the law on what constitutes as inflammatory and inciteful rhetoric  Jesus Christ.  Bro   flip it around. If BLM said and did the same thing  I doubt you  39 d be on this sub saying that. I  39 m also glad rddit doesn  39 t get to write laws  lol.  I absolutely would  because those are pretty common phrases repeated across the political spectrum and in no way inciting violence. It would barely cross my mind if some BLM activist said  we re coming for x  or about fighting something because they do it all the damn time. Yet I ve never considered that level of rhetoric to be associated with the riots during the summer  so don t even go there and pretend you know what I would say.  Ok  that proves my fucking point. All I was saying what that the rhetoric was obviously inflammatory  and the other guy said it was fine and not a big deal. Glad we are on the same page  Huh  Why would that prove your point  I specifically said the type of rhetoric you mentioned is not inflammatory even if it was said by BLM.  BLM did billions in damage and destroyed countless livelihoods  So would you or would you not say BLM used inflammatory rhetoric  That was the original point I was making.  Are you insane. You sound like a raving Liberal who uses the term Hate Speech...when the ACLU even says it doesn  39 t exist and has no Constitutionality.  Who the hell is downvoting this  It s simple truth  Ok  now do Democrats and the BLM riots. You know the difference  Everyone  including Trump  denounced it and told them to go home within the hour. What did the democrats do  That s right.   quot These bastards are going around telling the truth  and now people are angry. Stop this violent rhetoric at once  quot   It  39 s like when Adam Schiff came out with his own version of what the Ukraine call said...and everyone just ate it up. Barf.  This is what I ve noticed a ton of politics has been recently. Most of the conversations I see aren t actually about what was said  but what people think your intentions are.  intresting as pompeo is supposed to be a deep state guy  How is Pompeo avoiding negative press  Or am I just not seeing it   This is so true. I see so many conservatives acting like if they side with the media and against trump  all of a sudden the media will  quot like quot  them. In reality they  39 ll continue to smear you and you  39 ve gained nothing while subsequently alienating the vast majority of trump supporters who still believe in the president and consider stochastic terrorism to be thought crime bullshit only ever applied in one direction.  Pompeo   quot we  39 re planning on a peaceful transition into a 2nd Trump term quot   That was weeks ago  what about it   Are you joking  Your positing this like he just stated it  when he stated this weeks ago. Things have clearly changed  according to who  your blogs   The President of the United States. Did you watch his Twitter video  Oh wait...  lol  Go ahead and think about two facts before sucking down more of that koolaid   Trump stood up for the ppl  the most important thing  but the people  establishment GOP  didn  39 t back him up against the left. his presidency is over and the problem is bigger than we all thought   removed   its good in the sense that conservatives  39  eyes have now been opened. i think Trump just accelerated the rabidness and attack from the left. another GOP McCain or Bush type would  39 ve just slowed the onset of this war from the left for a few yrs or a decade.   we already are winning this. everything Trump has been saying for the last 4 years is true and it  39 s all going to play out  with proof  in front of the American public with the whole world watching. and it  39 s going to be glorious. none of what you  39 ve just seen matters. it  39 s a farce. a show. a literal coup. and Trump let them do all of this. he gave them exactly as much rope as they wanted  and they came back every day hungry for more.  i hope you  39 re right but it sure as shit doesn  39 t feel like we  39 re winning lol. it feels like we  39 re getting stabbed in the front and back. and it  39 s so toxic right now to be a conservative  whether you  39 re silent or vocal. but we gotta keep the fight up even on social media bc otherwise the left wins and the next generations don  39 t know any better   removed   good advice.  I  39 m really surprised Pompeo is defending Trump at this point  not because I don  39 t think Trump needs defending  but because Pompeo always struck me as Establishment  given his political roots and bosses in the past.  Pompeo has been a solid Trump loyalist.  He s not. He s been rock solid this whole time. Imagine the truth he sees being the scenes.

Yeah when I read this headline I said  oh that s fucking rich   This could be a BabylonBee headline.  I had to double check it  since it  39 s so obviously hypocritical. It  39 s a headline I would have written  authoritarians really have no shame.  Just ask his niece how the law treats rich and powerful people  You mean like it s protected you and your corruption and your son and his degeneracy   Yeah Trump  Do you think you re Joe Biden or something   If that were true  Biden and Hunter would be in jail right now.  Dont forget that he  39 s already bragged about having the Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating his son fired.   They know their customer  they are just making sure their customer knows they  39 re open for business.  Trump is going to get arrested and thrown in jail.  If that happens  there will be a civil war. I  39 m not advocating for it or commenting on whether or not it should happen. But that  39 s what would take place.  For the past few years we have heard that obama wouldn  39 t be charged for the crimes he commited while in office  now we are about to see an administration put it  39 s liberals friends to work on trump. Four years of  quot you just don  39 t charge the former president because the optics would be bad and set a horrible precedent quot  now it  39 s just another version of the hypocrisy.  Exactly    LOL  The hypocrisy of democrats gets so under my damn skin.  Whatever happened to the blatant insider trading committed by four members of Congress back in March   They got prosecuted right  Right   Unity  Unity  LoL  Hail Trump   With the exception of Biden family  obviously.  And they clintons  And obama  Hail Trump   What law did Trump break exactly   He broke the status quo in washington.  That s rich.  Seems like it protects democrats from every crime under the sun...  Bullshit.  Sorry  thought this was the BabylonBee for second.  Ironic  Leftist told us Trump would become a fascist while in office  four years  never even took a step towards it. No Biden isn  39 t even sworn in and he  39 s already acting like a fascist.  Not above the law   Oh.  Oh   If we  39 re doing that  let  39 s reopen some investigations.    Coming from the guy whose son smokes crack  bangs trafficked prostitutes and interferes with foreign governments and sells us out to china with impunity. Don  39 t forget  10  to the big guy.  Haha aaah yes  coming from the Biden family    Biden family on the other hand is above the law. Democrat Privilege.  Hahahahahahahaha     They  39 re just fucking with us at this point right    Is he referring to Hunter    Because he  39 s been protecting Hunter for decades.  Do you think the song  Fortunate Son  has a special meaning for the Biden s   Wow  I definitely feel the unity  s  Then why are Hillary and Bill and Hunter still not in jail...     I m confused. I feel like I m seeing  a href   r politics  r politics  a  articles being posted in this sub. Then they re awarded and applauded  What gives   If you see an award  95  of the time  it is from leftists trying to draw attention to their propaganda.  Especially if it is one of those weird emojis.  Lmao. Like the fucking mask one  I remember when it was verboten to even mention charging Hilary for her violations of Federal Law.    Pretty ironic for a man literally surrounded by scandals and allegations who is completely protected by the media and fellow corrupt authoritarian politicians.  Unless  of course  you re a Dem.  Then  Justice be damned  Shut up  man  Let  39 s see how this one ages   unless there is a  D  next to your name.  That just tastes of sweet sweet iron  some might call it a bit irony.   quot Unity quot   Trumps leaving office and still living in these guys heads. I think a fair amount of people on the left are gonna regret Trump not winning because he won  39 t be in office to bitch about him all day and night. Though I  39 m not expecting the coverage of Trump to go away lol.  The left is its own worst enemy  and has NO problem eating its own. As soon as Biden takes office  Democrats will start bitching about him  too. Just wait.  Pot meet kettle  And yet you and Hillary are still walking around free  And yet here I sit still waiting for the crooked elitist in the Democrat party  Hillary Clinton  to pay for their crimes.  At least our vote kept her out of the oval office.  He is a fucking liar and hypocrite.  Can I ask you a question s  without getting into an argument with the whole fucking internet  I  39 ve been curious about this for a few months.   It means you re sitting on the sidelines  wondering why the fuck we decided to have a winner takes all system. 1  of the vote should be 1  of the representation in government. Instead  half the country feels like it s losing every election  How odd of you to say that  big guy.  Holy shit how far up his own ass is he when he says this crap.  HAHAHHA now THAT is rich   Omg thats hilarious  One word   strong HUNTER.  strong   this guy hahaha  That  39 s fucking rich.  Trump isn t above the law  but Democrats like creepy Joe sure are   That s rich coming from you.  Does he not realise that 70  of this is big teck being anti conservatives. The other 30  is a message to Biden and the dems saying  quot do what we want you to do or your next quot .  Says the head of the Biden crime family  Good  He  39 s gonna do something about Amazon  Facebook  Twitter  Google  and Apple  thank God   Do not know that  but sure hell protected those thugs you took your knee. You dumb stupid weak sleepy corrupted shitty idiot.  Biden and the Democratic leadership are bullies. They resent Trump because he out played them for four years. Now they have power. They are going to use any and every method to punish Trump and Trump supporters. They will use big tech to silence anything that disagrees with their agenda. They will use the media to paint their cause as just while they put a knee on the neck of anyone who gets in their way. Biden has always been a bully. Look at the comments he has made even as his mind fades. Look at Nancy. As people were going hungry  she ate her fancy ice cream and held up relief for political reasons. While many common people have been fooled by the Democratic leadership  the Democratic Party is run by and ruled by evil.  It s like I woke up in opposite land  That s rich coming from him  Really  because it sure works out for your corrupt crime family and your crack addled degenerate child                                                                You re the one in power Biden  Lmfao yeah right  What a bunch of hypocrites

They re planning a lot more than cancel culture.   Re education or purging.  Oh the horror. Not that  I m pretty positive a lot of these people arnt cancelling Trump because they want to but because they feel like they have to or they ll be cancelled by cancel culture  I ve been wondering this myself. Do they really think this is good for their companies long term  Or are they just pandering for easy positive  and short term  headlines   2nd one  All it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.  Oh  that will change everything.  Screw the pga who gives a shit what they have to say

Its Fascism in the name of Anti Fascism  you create what you fear.  Orwellian doublespeak  Communism started with cleansing of those who got in the way  And continued with killing off the useful idiots  looking at you lefties.  The correct term in this case is Communism.   I  39 ve said it before   American kids these days ain  39 t tough enough for Communism.  I mean  they sure ain  39 t Russian.

Political hit list  sounds like a communist regime to me.  When Saddam won his election  the first thing he did was to kill all of his political opponents.  Take a look at what happened to Deng Xaoping  when  Jiang Zemin took over.  Thankfully so far we don t live in a country that handles elections that way.  For now at least instead of killing they will just blackball everyone they disagree with.

I don  39 t think it will protect us. I don  39 t think the military can be as counted on as people think. When push comes to shove and orders are given I  39 m seeing a lot of complaining but not much else.  A bunch of cave dwelling folks with ak 47  39 s and some explosive devices fought back and stalemated our military and they beat the Russians outright. The Viet Cong beat us handily with small arms and traps. Isis just up until the Trump admin was running rampant through the Middle East.

You don  39 t want to to be accused of looking at or distributing  child pornogrpahy. Joe Biden is covering for his criminal son  it makes you wonder the crimes the Joe himself has comitted.

Biden should be in jail  100  lie on both counts  and he knows it because he directly benefits from it.

That s what the 2nd will be when only the very wealthy can afford the licenses and taxes for guns  mags  carry permits  and good lawyers if they ever have to use their gun.

Trump served his country  did not take a salary and this is the way these despicable  vile creatures treat him.  Time to treat Biden and Harris the exact same fucking way.

It s like you ve seen them do this before...who knew   While big tech censors dissenting voices.  Are they hoping to run their lawyers ragged  Everything being proposed right now is unconstitutional and is going to get fought in the courts.   They don  39 t care. They have full control over congress and the executive branch. They have also been talking on and off about packing the supreme court. They are on a pretty large power trip and I just don  39 t think they care about what is legal under the constitution anymore. Plus they know the media will back them up 100  of the time  and with these crackdowns on free speech  they know the opposition in the media is continually being silenced so they wont have that to worry about as much as in the past.  They ll have to go through the Supreme Court to just pass a law  won t happen.  I don t think they are thinking that far ahead. Also I m not entirely sure they won t just ignore the constitution and when the Supreme Court tries to stop them  if the court actually acts  will just ignore pack the court.  All the Dems have to do is threaten to pack the Court and it will roll over and let them do whatever they want  just like it did when Roosevelt threatened to do so.  It  39 s funny because Biden was quoted  before this current run  that packing the court is crazy  ridiculous  and should never be done.  Save those videos to your personal drives.

This is one of those issues the courts will either take up or the people will lose confidence in the system. The electoral college is very specifically spelled out in the constitution  and ignoring the system of checks and balances prescribed in the constitution means betraying your oath of office. Congressman Cohen here is attempting to betray his oath of office.  Does anyone have confidence in the system right now   I don  39 t get it  why would anyone believe the system works anymore.  Because daddy Zuckerberg tells me to  BINGO.  We were never truly in control of the situation were we  They played us all like fucking fiddles and we blindly marched to their tune right over the cliff and into the trap that was the capitol storming didn t we   They control congress  they control the executive  they control the courts  proven by how many election cases were thrown out explicitly because the court just didn  39 t want to examine the case   and they are going to force control of the supreme court. They control a vast majority of state and local political offices and the nation  39 s entire beurocratic system is full of anti conservative Dems  down to the clerk signing drivers license applications. They control education and academia  and they control the media. All opposition is silenced or actively being purged  calls for political genocide are growing. If you think they  39 re going to stop at  quot unconstitutional quot  then you  39 re in for a very rude awakening when they start really pushing everything they want through with no opposition. Burying your head in the sand or trying to pretend like you  39 re one of the good ones isn  39 t going to save you.  They  39 re hoping to pay enormous legal fees to litigate nonsense  so that these politico law firms can then donate the money back to them.   It  39 s a money laundering scheme.    Trump had 100 000 people at his rallys in Pennsylvania  in Arizona and in Georgia  there was no way he was going to lose those states  and there  39 s no way the Dems could cheat... oh wait.  They need to win qualified majority as well. But they already have MSM support for that.  No it won t  the constitution is only worth what people decide it s worth.  We could have presidents last for life if nobody was capable of enforcing otherwise.  It will happen...  Since when have democrats cared about the Constitution   Why waste time  Let s just go full socialist in the first 30 days  Faster than that apparently  we are only on day  10   Might as well  not sure if you have seen it but they have already put up a large list of gun control bills as well.  Wow  you  39 re right.  H.R. 127  Here is the list so far that I can come up with   If they do away with the electoral college  add more states  or stack the courts  I would wholeheartedly support the formation of the United Conservative States of America.  I think we all will. But we get to take the name United States of America. They are something else now.  It  39 s a stupid fucking idea  but at least this is the proper way to attempt it.    Ratification isn t necessary anymore if the courts don t have the guts to take cases.  Also there would have to be someone to challenge it.  Unless they successfully keep conservatives divided and get large majorities in Congress 2022.   removed    removed    removed    removed   Lmao. Never will there be a republican president again.  Defeatist attitude  never give up.  Especially when it s about liberty  They literally just stole two elections back to back and the only people who cared enough to show up were labeled terrorists and denounced by both parties and the media.  NO REPUBLICAN WILL EVER WIN AGAIN is a statement of fact.  Go jerk off to your Trump shrine while the rest of us continue to fight  Enjoy your  quot voting quot  while they rig the election.  lol  Are you minding me  If that was to happen look who controls a mass majority of the states.. it s cities with deep blue ties  So far they  39 ve introduced gun restrictions to take away 2nd Amendment rights  now the abolition of the Electoral College. Can there be any doubt they are going to try to do all those things Trump  et al warned us about  Too bad so many didn  39 t listen  now we all pay the price.  That check isn  39 t going to be handed over I don  39 t think  I could be wrong though  seems like there are still a lot of conservatives in complete denial. They think the GOP will come riding in and save us all  we are such fools.  Yeah the states won  39 t put up with that shit  This is how you will turn a democracy into a dictatorship  with a puppet leader.  Didn  39 t the SCOTUS just rule that Texas was not able to tell other states how to run their election processes....essentially   layman  39 s terms....     So  how would getting rid of the electoral college be any different....    Scroll through my comments  I have been saying this for months.  BE VERY AFRAID OF WHAT IS COMING  A DICTATORSHIP     The US is now a one party country  in 4 years will be a Socialist country and we got a chance to watch it  front row   SC will be flooded and Puerto Rico will be a state.  Done and done   Oh yeah  the US will also lose its status as the world  39 s reserve currency.  So that  39 s it  California and NYC are going to decide who wins the election from now on  Might as well tell the other States no not bother voting.  Here we go  The fall of the Republic is near  That is a bit above the paygrade of a resolution  kind of requires a constitutional amendment.  How to impressively fail.  Why bother  they found a way to steal the last election so just keep doing that and let the illusion that votes matter keep everyone quiet.  Why not establishing monarchy  while we at it   No need. With new rules on counties doing free unchecked unrequested mailing of ballots  there were counties where 99  votes were sent by mails  Republicans will never win POTUS  Senate or Congress.  We need to impeach joe manchin now and get a reliable republican. What are you doing west virginia

t3_kvimmy,Hockey analyst fired for saying Not even any woman here to disrupt your concentration when discussing the NHLs bubble,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvimmy/hockey_analyst_fired_for_saying_not_even_any/,This wasn t the reason as for why he was fired. To put it lightly  Milbury is a blockhead. A lot of people hate him because he crosses the line quite frequently with his very hot takes. If anyone is wondering who this guy actually is  he played for the Bruins and went into the stands and beat someone with their own shoe.  We should start a list.  Most reasonable women would roll their eyes and laugh at this. It s just stupid and silly   not a brutal attack on all women. The only women with a thin skin are the ones who have subscribed to the 47th wave of feminism where women don t even exist anymore.  AKA the ones that can  39 t distract a man. Feminazis are always female incels.  Any woman with half a brain would laugh at this. They know they distract men  and most of them enjoy doing it.  It  39 s only insulting to women that can  39 t get a man  39 s attention. Make no mistake  they  39 re the ones  quot outraged. quot   I wish they fired him over being a shit commentator instead of empty virtue signaling. At least he is gone.  He would be hired elsewhere if we had a competition of ideas. Too bad all the good ideas are censored.  Big fucking deal. Mike milbury is kind of a dink   but now that I think about it  I enjoy his analysis.
t3_kupkwt,Russian Dissident Alexey Navalny Decries Twitter Censorship Of Trump Compares To Kremlin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kupkwt/russian_dissident_alexey_navalny_decries_twitter/,Don t be fooled by this guy. He s the male version of AOC in Russia  Putin still shouldn t have tried to kill him  If that s actually true then I do agree with that. I m just not convinced it is true. Putin has degrees of corruption just like any other politician or political leader  but I don t believe certain things the media says about him  with good reason  Putin probably has an actual degree of corruption considering he was a kgb spy.  Okay  and there were presidents who worked for the CIA. All politicians are corrupt but remember why MSM keeps demonizing Putin like they do Trump  I  39 m not arguing for nor against Alexey but comparing him to AOC is wildly inaccurate. Both he and Putin fall outside of the American left right paradigm.

t3_kufbgj,Lead singer Tommy Vext from band Bad Wolves has been forced out over his conservative political beliefs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kufbgj/lead_singer_tommy_vext_from_band_bad_wolves_has/,Their biggest hit is a cover song.  So the rest of the band must not have been creative powerhouses.  They  quot updated quot  the lyrics for Zombie and I was just not a fan  the Cranberries version is 100 times better.  To be fair  I do believe Dolores was supposed to do the vocals but she died right before they were going to record so the guy doing the vocals was a last minute thing and meant as a tribute to her.  It wasn  39 t an awful cover  but I do think with the updated lyrics the song lost its power. It went from being about the Troubles  or I guess end of the Troubles to being just about modern warfare  and I didn  39 t think it resonated the same way. And you are spot on with Dolores  39  vocals for the song are just unbeatable.  The thing with Zombie is that it s a protest song about a very specific terrorist bombing during a very specific time by a very specific group that s no longer relevant  so re releasing it 25 years later and NOT changing the lyrics really wouldn t make any logical sense. While I wish they just left it alone  it is her song after all so if anyone has a right to change the lyrics it would be her  and who knows what the updated version would have been like had she not passed. Now with her passing the band was in a spot where either they have to scrap the project altogether or release it not just with different lyrics but with completely different vocals. Must have been a pretty tough spot.  You re entirely correct that the Bad Wolves version was basically going to be a new one including the original lead vocalist  Dolores  from the first song. She did die. I believe all or most of the money generated from the new cover was donated to some charity as requested by Dolores s family  em or  em  it was given to her family.  And I still prefer the original.  A singer can always find a band... Back to the garage boys  your 15 minutes is up.  Leftism is a cancerous cult.  Damn it I really liked that band. I m sure they will go to shit now like every other band that breaks up.  David Draiman did well with Device.  Hopefully Vext too.  Disturbed didn  39 t break up though  that was just a side project.  They were on  hiatus  for YEARS.  That s a shame  he had a nice voice. Saw them live a few times as openers for FFDP.  Where is Biden and all his unity and healing talk now   He is counting his 10   We are being pushed to create a conservative only society.  They re coming for all of us.  You could say he was ...... a wolf in sheep s clothing.  Before everyone grabs their pitchforks  it is quite possible he quit because he was sick of them and their politics  not the other way around like most are currently assuming. It doesn t seem to really say one way or the other.  He stated as such   I thought that all of them are conservatives  Also  didn t the former lead singer  guy who was just let go  from Bad Wolves sing a few songs for FFDP when their lead singer took time off   Never heard of them.

They want revenge.  Whether you like him or not Trump said he would fight the Swamp and the Swamp has bitten back and all who supported or cheered Trump on are about to get bit too.  Men like Randall Lane may be abhorrent  inconvenient  and unfit to be American but the ultimately unfortunate truth is they are far from alone. We postulate that a good percentage of the 80 million  that voted Democratic are exactly like Mr. Lane and would be no differerent were they in control of the reins of power  If only they would have done this for the culprits of the financial crisis.

Can confirm police violence is only accepted and absolutely necessary when dealing with any Conservative.  Leftists stand so frivolously against the death of a Capitol officer  which is sad and my deepest sympathies go to the family  but did they forget their objective for the summer was to defund  belittle and bring harm to police  They weren t outraged at that. If they weren t turning a blind eye  they were egging it on. Party of incognizant hypocrites.  They didn  39 t give a shit about dead cops until it  39 s politically convenient  it  39 s sickening.  Your mistake is pretending that they have morals or values beyond concentrating political power for themselves.  My city had two officers shot during the riots and it  39 s sub was clearly cheering about it.  This cop is just a political prop to them. They didn  39 t suddenly start caring about police right now. This is the democrats trying to get away with murder. Actually  the murder of Ashli Babbit.  It was only a matter of time.

Yeah bud  Flynn s driving the car lol  What  you mean Walt Jr.   underrated comment lmaooooo  Buckle up buckaroos  I guess Rudy is riding shotgun in that case.  Drives to the next house   I can just see that being a Family Guy cutaway  This is some fifty shades of grey stuff lmao  I was hoping it would be the Tom Hanks in the grocery store pasta.  Too bad he couldn t have enlisted the help of Jehovah s Witnesses   they are professional door knockers    My life would be complete.  Yeah so Pence hates  him btw  Has that always been true or just since the 6th   Apparently just since the sixth. Imagine sucking up like an industrial grade vacuum cleaner  and you still get tossed under the bus.  I  39 d say for a while now. Pence didn  39 t support him in the primaries  and in 2016 tried to replace trump shortly after the access hollywood tapes got released. He is also party responsible for flynn  39 s ouster and the extradition of Julian Assange.  Something that  39 s been slowly building I think.  Always  I would pay for this to happen to me.  Tbh I wouldn  39 t mind it  Pence   quot get in loser  we  39 re going conspiracy spreadin  quot   It wont be Pence driving...   Yo I would love that  I  39 m guessing he  39 ll realize there  39 s a whole dedicated press conference room in the WH  with reporters on standby. He  39 ll just write tweets on paper and call hasty press conferences to read them to whoever is there.  I bet they would just ignore him  honestly. It took them 4 years but they  em finally  em  realized that if they ignore him he has no power.  I was disappointed to hear he  39 d been banned from Twitter  but a friend turned me on to a new guy by the name of Ronaldo Trumpo who seems to agree with the President on almost everything.  Oh what a coincidence. I came across this fella on Twitter  Ronaldinio Trumpinio. He also agrees 100  with Mr Trump s ideas.  also  John Barron also seems to be in alignment.  I gotta go look that guy up   Huh  he sounds like Ronald Reagan fused with Trump  This is so good lol  If only he had a press room in the house he lives in with 24 7 access to major news networks.  and you know that at least that Acosta cnn guy will be there.  bring popcorn.  While I appreciate the satire  let  39 s not forget that inside his house is a press room and a podium. He can still address the nation the way presidents before him did for decades.  You can  39 t not love this.  I shared it on Facebook because it made me chuckle and all I got was an angry react from a friend who loves Trump.  I mean that would be cool though to see the president at your front door. I  39 ve never meet a president before.  I have been within 20 feet of Trump at rallies before he was president  and then was about 100 ft from him at a rally as president. Pretty cool   Literally had lunch with him in Palm Beach at a sales motivation event with Tony Robbins. He was the same man as he is now. He told stories and jokes. It was a great experience.  Nice  I want to just have a lunch or something with someone like that one day. Not talk shop or anything  just  quot Oh  this meal is great. Reminds me of that time I was in Charleston. You ever been there  quot  and let him just carry on about whatever.  Damn that s pretty cool  my parents actually met Donald Trump about 15 years ago at a fundraiser in our small town he did  they still have a picture of them standing next to Donald trump and it is really cool to think about  So many people downvoting so hard lol  It  39 s 85  upvoted  bro.

It s crazy today my pro trump posts are getting crazy upvotes  I usually get into the negatives.  I don  39 t understand why anyone not able to comment is able to vote.

Trump could literally end world hunger and people would still hate him   Donald Trump puts millions of food service workers out of jobs    He only did it to try and get people s votes   It  39 s true  I did. I shamelessly used people  39 s emotions to farm karma.  I definitely don  39 t like him but I would give respect where it  39 s due.  He ended war basically in an entire region of the world... no credit given  i mentioned this to my left facebook friends  i was swamped with replies downplaying this and really how unimportant it was.  guess i need to watch cnn to for better opinions.

Chances are it s being upvoted by people from  a href   r politics  r politics  a  but it seems there s a decent few people here who can take a joke.  Some conservatives. Some  Politicians are going to have to take note. Maybe this will create a resurgence of campaigning by train. That would be a sight to see.  Everyone in the GOP probably sighing a breath of relief seeing that  He didn t shout it  he declared it.

Who  39 s not going to open the door to the President of the United States  Lol  So that  39 s who was knocking at my door at 6am   Honestly  as unhinged as Trump probably is right now  no train is wreckier than Twitter. Eff those a holes.  When should I be expecting him  I ll join.  The fact that Twitter banned him for spewing nonsense is hypocritical when that  39 s what half the people on that accursed site do  and they get away with it just fine...  Islamic terrorists  leftarded anarchists  and demented blood cult despots calling for the eradication of the Jews are still on Twitter.   The level of commitment.  I d be pretty honored if this happened tbh  Absolutely. We all would.   removed   Highly doubt. They want to wipe out anything and everything Trump from the minds of conservatives.
t3_kuix5l,Arnold Schwarzenegger likens Capitol riot to Nazi attack on Jews,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuix5l/arnold_schwarzenegger_likens_capitol_riot_to_nazi/,The left has been waiting for this four years  Of course they re going to run with it. They are going to fit four years of their anger into a couple weeks.  Ain  39 t that the truth. I  39 m thinking they may have jumped the gun though. After the dust settles  in the average American  39 s mind  this is not going to play into the  quot WORST THING IN THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLIC quot  drivel they  39 re spouting. And if it does we  39 re really in trouble. But I  39 m hopeful this will be another nail in the coffin of media  social and legacy  credibility.  Oh  you mean like the rioters in Kenosha Who burn down buildings and  killed people  Or like the residence of Chaz   ...or white antifa rioters who burned down  30 million federal project homes which house poor black people in Minneapolis  Or white liberals burning small businesses owned by Indians  Asians  Blacks  and Latinos and justifying it because  quot they have insurance quot    Officer David Dorn  rest in peace officer  was killed by a black man looting his friends store.  Good call. I am so out of it today  It s fine. I am too  Doesn t fit the narrative  sorry  Or like the liberal rioters who did the exact same thing during the Kavanaugh confirmation  except that they were welcomed in and allowed to disrupt the proceedings    Let  39 s imagine how the 2020 summer of riots could of been different if there was this type of condemnation.  I didnt know he was a propagandist too  I thought the guy who compared the capital riot to 911 was retarded.   It s not that they re out of depth. It s that they re reading a script. One cannot be so shallow and blind.  I m not so sure...   removed   Same  Exactly this. I don t support what the rioters did  but you re right in the fact that there has been a massive overreaction to what occurred that is doing further damage and driving more people to specific sides  if you will.  The worst part is they make it even more redicuolous each time they talk about. They are like dads talking about the fish they caught 10 years ago.  Look  it was  em this  em  big  I have a right to be proud of it   What s even worse than  em that  em  is this is being labeled as  brave  by mainstream media news publications online. The lack of awareness is baffling.  The roids  quot pumped him up quot  but killed the brain cells. smh   removed   If anything Arnold  this was a Reichstag Fire for the Democrats to erase conservative voices.  Exacto mundo. Only what took Nazis 5 years from Reichstag Fire to Kristallnacht.  When the overreaction is worse than the action.  And has lasted like ten times as long  Except that the only thing that parallels nazism is the democrat response to the occupation of the capitol building.  Suddenly lawmakers are Jews   Godwin  39 s Law is permeating every facet of life for the worse.  Sounds like something a Nazi would say. I  39 m off to report you to the wrong think police.  Arnold your looking like a Steven Seagal...  This shit is out of control. These events are not even in the same universe with respect to comparing to one another  and it degrades the horrors of what happened to Jews under Nazi oppression.  No one ever accused this guy of being smart.  Had child with his maid. Talks about  quot eating is not cheating quot . No different than Bill Clinton  aside from being not as smart.  Weird thing for an Austrian to say. Does go to show there may be a coordinated effort as Biden made similar Nazi references. Hard to tell because that  39 s been a common thing from Democrats for years.  talk about pissing on holocaust victims. what a shameful thing to say.  Is it just a coincidence he  39 s Austrian  or...   Totally the same thing. They took all the dems and threw them into camps where they starved them  stripped them naked  shot them  burned them and gassed them. It was strikingly similar.  Get back in the choppa Arnold.  Excellent use of projection lmao  Does the cia have you pushing too many pencils   Republicans are going to destroy their own party.  A true example of  quot those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it quot . These idiots feel like they are on the right side of history until they aren  39 t.  Truth is it  39 s exactly like hitler  39 s overtaking of a country they just think they are the Jews not the nazis.  How does he  em compare  em  these two events  Not even if you compare styles are they similar or mean the same thing  Windows were broken  that s it.   Coming from the man who allegedly had a collection of and enjoyed listening to Nazi marching anthems when he arrived in America.  This is the exact same reaction the nazis would have had for the Jews if they had revolted to build support for exterminating them  Arnold  39 s father was literally an SS officer.

t3_ku6v3s,Amazon Booting Parler Off Its Web Hosting Service,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku6v3s/amazon_booting_parler_off_its_web_hosting_service/,This is fucking insane   removed   Almost every app you use pays an AWS subscription including Reddit  Sure  doesn t mean I can t try to limit what I give them. Not getting my  13 a month anymore for prime  and everything that I can I will source elsewhere now. I spent   5k on Amazon.com last year  bet you that it s under a few hundred bucks or less this year.  So this is the prequel to 1984...  Amazon hosts 40  of cloud hosted websites on the internet. Seems extremely problematic that Amazon can simply pick and choose which sites they want shut down across almost half of the internet  True but one isn  39 t obligated to use the cloud. The cloud is a convenience. You are still empowered to purchase and host your own servers. Also there are several competitors within cloud  even outside the big names AWS  Azure  GCP.  Yes  if you have a few billion laying around  and time to build buildings  buy thousands of servers  and lay fiber  and program them.  Uh  you just rent rack space at somewhere like hurricane electric  buy some servers  switches and firewalls. A lot of companies could save money by running their own servers. AWS is great for startups but after a certain point it s cheaper to host it yourself. I don t know how many users parlor has but I doubt it would be more than 200k to move to a self hosted model  Tough on short notice.  Yeah  true. I was just pushing back on the uninformed post about cost.  It  39 s not near that complicated. I worked for a company that was dependant on AWS and we moved to our own Cloud which saved us a ton of money and gave us better control when issues came up.    No  more like 100k in hardware and a few k a month for rack space. Long term it  39 s actually cheaper than Amazon.  Google has spent billions in infrastructure  obviously a smaller operation would be cheaper.  Democracy dies in darkness   em  What I remember about the rise of the Empire is... is how quiet it was.   em   They don t like free speech  But Amazon does like slave labor  since they continue to sell products made by Chinese slaves in concentration camps.  They are also not exactly kind to their warehouse labor either in the states.  This is just bezos kissing the ring to continue anticompetitive practices.  Or conservatives  They didn t like free speech ever since they banned the sale of confederate flags on their site.  The response by the left to the Capitol is completely disproportionate. Parler literally didn  39 t even do anything. It has nothing to do with Trump.. This past week and next will be a defining moment in American history  assuming we actually still have honest historians in the future. Although based on how things currently are  I am not confident at all that history will be accurately written by most historians. We are already seeing tons of revisionist history and lies being spread around all the time  Facebook also deleted the WalkAway page.  This one is the most disturbing to me. Literally nothing to do with inciting violence. Was clearly just removed bc it goes directly against the Democrat positions  Parler is rapidly transforming into  quot The NAZI Network quot  in the fevered minds of many far leftists.  People used the excuse that parts of it were like a cesspool  and I guess no one has ever even seen twitter lol   removed   Just canceled Prime  it was the least I could do to say  thanks  for letting me know they have no morals or backbone.  They could be forcing us to wear shirts identifying us as right wingers and many here would continue to force us to  stick to our values   This is horrible for the AWS brand. No one is going to want to use AWS when they can and will shut off your site if you get  quot cancelled quot .  Wrong most the liberal idiots will think they are safe till it is there time.  The hypocrisy. One of their UK employees suffered a fatal heart attack whilst working   lay undiscovered for ages   but when he put the wrong item in a bin he was corrected immediately.  How big of an issue is this really  Assume that I know nothing about web hosting  why can t Parler just move to another service    strong TL DR   I don  39 t know how reliant Parler is upon AWS specific services  but this looks  strong   strong  em very  em   strong   strong grim for them as a company.  strong   They aren  39 t on their proprietary stuff. So they can move the ceo said they have talks on going we have a but of hope.  I  39 m not a Parler user  but I hope they can make that jump. Competition in the social media sector is sorely lacking  especially given the current climate. Facebook  Twitter  and Reddit need some healthy competition to remind them they can be replaced.  Thank you so much for the well informed answer and the time it took you explain all this   Glad it helped   because there are only so many cloud hosting services  and all of them are going to refuse to take Parler  39 s service. Microsoft  Google and Amazon are the big ones but even the smaller cloud hosting services rely on these giants as well  if they try to offer parler a safe harbor then they risk the same fate. Most of the internet runs on services provided by these companies  or is supported directly by these companies. Even if Parler hosts their own datacenter  their own physical building and bare metal computers  the tech giants could make their DNS servers not route to their website or route to a black hole although it would be a big move to do such a thing... i  39 m sure the tech giants have some clout over the root DNS servers too but anyway  their only option is try hosting their own physical location s  which is going to cost way more  and if any natural disaster or  quot Natural quot  disaster happens their probably done with.  The CEO basically said they are done if AWS drops them  Not true. Their latest statement is that they  39 ve built from bare metal so they  39 re not reliant on the AWS infrastructure. They believe they  39 ll be able to be back up within a week  What s aws   Amazon Web Services.  A cost effect way to  pay as you go  for web servers  databases and more.  Thanks for the info. I didn t realize they and other companies hosted services like that. I thought those companies had their own. But I can see that it s quite expensive. It sounds like a market that could be worth something if someone started their own data center. But I don t know the in and outs of that stuff. I m sure it s quite expensive.  This post will really be in the weeds  but I do this stuff for a living so I ll explain it a little further for anyone who is interested. There are really three ways to go about it   For your first example if someone made their own data center they would still have to follow their IP s TOS right  I can see that being in  violation  somehow and the company could be purged or stripped of their internet for whatever reason.   Ah  I remember when NN was being pushed hard on this site and every sub had something to say about it. Interesting to see the affects from the push. I could tell Reddit s over reach was too much when they did that and you could see their reach during 2016 for certain.   The internet of the 90s was great. You could setup your own website using a computer that sat under your desk. Do that today and your poor computer would be crushed by the sheer number of Chinese bots trying to hack your website.  Not in 24 hours.  They need a lot of infrastructure so they used Amazon s servers   I guess not realizing that Amazon would ever consider pulling the plug on them.  Google and Apple did the same.  They will be back in around a week.  This concerted attack on Parler makes me think Democrats plan on doing something this week and they need their corporate masters to keep us all from communicating.  Throwing Trump in jail   And then they will be DDoS  39 d.  I  39 m going to miss this sub when they ban it.  I have been an Amazon Prime member since the service began several years ago  but no more.  Bezos Amazon has crossed the line.  I am dropping my Amazon Prime membership and I will no longer buy from Amazon.  Several other businesses offer online shopping with free delivery and no membership fee.  Walmart and Homedepot even accept Paypal for payment.  I  39 m done with Amazon and will be finding an alternative e mail service to gmail.  Important  If you are iPhone the way you stop Apple from deleting Parler from you phone is   I m so confused. On what grounds are they doing this  What violations has Parler committed  Catered to a conservative crowd  Fuck off Amazon  They have to sue. It  39 s as simple as that. Companies can  39 t hide behind being independent. It  39 s obvious these tech companies are conspiring  and that  39 s illegal.  What happens when we find out the rioters were Apple and Google users as well   Oh  nothing   Gab has its own server so... also they are developing their own device  Clouthub  Yikes   This greatly concerns me professionally.  My organization is working on a large project that s hosted on AWS.  If they are willing to do this  I can easily see them shutting us down too. Definitely a hot topic for this week s project meeting.

It definitely sent a message  but the consequences on the whole of the right are much more drastic than the message sent.  The fools didn t realize only Democrats are allowed to do that.  143 people  no violence as per the article you cited.   removed   Look at the bills on gun control the house is already pushing.  Not good.  Well for one it would help if government wasn  39 t so partisan. The Democrat voters are bitter of the lack of bipartisanship during the Obama years. So that doesn  39 t help. Then the polarisation of current politics doesn  39 t help either.   Well government is partisan so we just have to deal with it.  What is your suggestions besides  quot cant we all just get along quot    Yiu really think the GOP wins a lot of elections when Texas eventually turns blue  Let  39 s face it  moving a bit further left may help draw in more voters.  Oh I dont think the GOP will win another significant election again ever  regardless of how much they compromise their principles to attract supposed moderates.  Now that the leftists control everything they are just going to make it even easier to commit fraud by removing any and all verification of voters.  This will be covered up by their surrogates in big tech and media who will spin it as some significant gain in voting rights.  The GOP is done.  How can the left even say what happened was a riot   Portland was  is  a riot.  It doesn  39 t excuse breaking windows to try to get in  or acting foolishly with going into the capital.  It just didn  39 t look like a riot to me.  And  yes  the left and the media will jump on anything if it  39 s against Trump.  I  39 ve never seen so much hatred for one man in my life time.  Persecution backed by government during a period of four years guaranteed.    x200B

The left cares about blue lives now..  They were literally inciting violence against police for a year.  We know for sure one protester was shot by a cop.  Beyond that  numbers are as trustworthy as Kungflu stats.   quot I have evidence that will lead to the arrest of Hillary clinton quot   If they just link things to the riots it ll really turn people.  s  So he was doing his job and responding to a riot and now he s dead via suicide.   I mean it does happen.

Gab is experiencing surge and twitter is allegedly losing users.  Twitter won  39 t let people delete their accounts apparently.  Glad I never created one  As of when  You can always deactivate it.  glad i was able to delete mine yesterday  why they wouldn  39 t allow   Probably to stop the mass exodus  which looks bad for them. Stock will dip. It shows how many were only there for conservatives. Might cause others to leave as well.   A large drop causes their stock to drop. When they sell ads they claim x number of users etc.   If your account is suspended  they literally will not let you delete your account.  Thats what I and others are saying  I think. People are trying to delete an unsuspended account and Twitter wont let them. After you send a request to delete  they suspend the account.  2050  just find ur own planet bro   em Then proceeds to blow up our planet  em   This is going to end poorly  For who  No one in the government is coming after Dorsey that piece of fuck.  For the country.  Silencing half the country by force isn t going to win anyone s opinion over  all you do is piss people off further.  There is no unity here  only division.  Take away peoples voice and you only increase the chance for physical violence.    Yes it will the left is cheering what is going on  I doubt it. The only reason 2020 was a  quot crazy quot  year was because or corona. 2021 will be more of the same.  Parler has an excellent case for antitrust.  Pretty sketchy Apple and google ban them within hours of Twitter banning Trump...  That  39 s called a cartel. Big tech is a cartel.  It  39 s what we call collusion  which is definitely illegal.  Like it ever get through the court system.  The courts will just weasel their way out of this citing some technical impropriety.  If only conservatives could appoint more judges...  Perhaps not but the merits are good   deleted   Maybe they can crowdfund. Although realistically sites like GoFundMe would probably take them down.  Parler functions also in Europe. They could make a complaint to the EU Commission that would gladly use some hammer of justice to get some rightness to the world.  EU definitely isn  39 t an ally to conservatives. But I agree if they have a beef with the tech companies  it might be an avenue to get retribution when obvious collusion manipulation is at play.   removed   Actually big companies very often do make complaints to EU. Just  a href  https   www.wsj.com articles slack files eu antitrust complaint against microsoft 11595423056   7E text The 20complaint 2C 20filed 20Wednesday 20to widely 20used 20Office 20productivity 20suite.  rel  nofollow  last July Slack left anti competition complaint  a  against Microsoft to EU authorities. It is completely valid thing to do  especially when the media and corporations claim that they are just acting as corporations   business as normal. If it is business as normal  then filing anti competition complaint in foreign court is also business as normal.  How so   If it makes you feel any better  everyone still hates Dorsey.   For the left. They went too far  They always do. That s why I m not as worried as some. They always push too far and voters put them back in their place.  I don t appreciate being called dense. Do I think voter fraud cost Trump the election  Absolutely. Do I think Democrats will get away with that in every state in a non Presidential election year  2022   Absolutely not. 2022 is going to be 2010 on steroids.  Jack is a billionaire psychopath. The only way this would end poorly for him is if all conservatives boycott twitter and more importantly  Cash App and square. Cash app and square is where he made his billions. If every conservative small business owner and consumer refuses to ever use square to purchase or sell stuff he would make a tearful apology.  Tom would never do this to his. He just wanted to be our friend. But seriously social media was a mistake.  Never felt bad about deleting him until this comment.  Tom was a good guy.  I sense this is going to cause a lot more anger in the country.  I too sense a disturbance in the force. I pray there s no more violence. I also fail to see how this doesn t embolden the die hard Trumpers who already see everyone is out to get him. Big tech is just confirming many suspicions of freedom loss and encroaching communism  You  39 re more admirable than me. I don  39 t see a solution that doesn  39 t involve protest. The big tech companies will assist one another to avoid competition arising.  Well  if we actually had a free market  maybe. We don  39 t  not with big tech at least  its all cronyism. But I agree.  I guess that  39 s the irony. For the market to be free  it needs to be protected from monopolies and powers like these. But the law that protects us doesn  39 t mean anything because the incoming administration is on the same team as these massive corporations.  You  39 re missing the big picture. This is deliberate  they  39 re trying to piss people off to cause further division and violence.   That s not surprising. More division causes more unrest  the perfect environment for the government to step in and  save the day  aka goodbye freedoms  Good. People should be angry. The public forum becoming an echo chamber isn  39 t good for anyone.  This is a worldly concern. All the french politicians  tweeted xd  about it  What   What did they say   These tech dweebs think they  39 re untouchable.  They are untouchable. Every progressive on the internet is applauding this move and justifying it as an exercise of corporate free speech.  They are untouchable.  If a Trump administration couldn t stop their monopolies  do you honestly think a pro big tech Biden administration will    Trump didn  39 t even try until like 4 months before he had to leave office.    Dave Rubin  Woah. That is just kind of evil. I could understand if Jack wanted to comment on this by saying something about how getting rid of Parler helps to get rid of hate speech and prevent future attacks on the country  and continue to push their narrative. Instead he puts out a tweet with a heart and the image of the top charts and parler no longer there. Parler was trending number one on the charts and was a threat to Twitter  now it no longer is because apple and google got rid of it. With the context of this tweet  it really shows that Twitter was more focused on keeping their monopoly instead of helping to fight off hate speech.  Jack is a fuckin piece of shit. Plain and simple.  What a complete dick.  This is awful. If you check the popular page on reddit  all you  39 ll see is every sub supporting this guy  and other companies  censoring conservatives. Pathetic.  Popular page is usually toxic filth. The past few days its been nuclear waste level of crap.  Leaving Twitter and selling my stock.  I just barely got into trading  I  39 ve gotta figure out how shorts work by 4am    WeBull   gt  Sign Up   gt  Deposit money   gt   quot Options quot    gt  Buy  quot Put quot   That plunge was beautiful   Twitter is going to destroy itself and I could give a shit less. Do they really think advertisers are paying to have their products marketed to the Antifa BLM crowd  No. They aren t paying big money to market to people who can t afford to buy their shit. Eventually  they ll chase off most of the productive members of society and be left with a bunch of people who are unemployed  drowning under student loan debt that landed them nothing more than a job at Chipotle  have severe mental health addiction issues  etc. Those people don t have money to spend on the bullshit that gets marketed towards people on social media. Twitter s main product  advertising  will plummet in value. It s gonna be hard making that 100k bribe look like a sale of a legitimate advertising space when their ad space isn t valued at nearly that much anymore.   I think you underestimate how many affluent people are currently on the brainwashed spell of wokeshevism.  Yeah but those people aren t spending money on the cheap shit being advertised to Twitters target demographic. If I m reaching out for Twitter to advertise me  I m selling cheap consumerist bullshit  not the stuff that rich people buy. There s a reason a lot of people have never even heard of some high end brands. Those brands don t need to advertise because the people who want that shit know it exists because of its reputation as a product  not some marketing gimmick.  Saw Jack on joe rogans podcast and weasel is such a good explanation.  Was great to see tim pool call him out on everything he said but he  39 s such a slimy fuck he kept dancing around them.  I never knew I could hate a person as much as I hate Jack Dorsey.  I see he  39 s too ashamed to have that peach fuzz he calls a beard in his profile picture.  Woke Rasputin and Android Zuck v. 2.0   deleted   I respect your point of view but I feel it is mistaken  AWS got big because of government contracts. This will only lead to more division and more echo chambers. This will push everyone into bubbles which will overtime make Americans more and more disconnected from one another. People currently are warming up to the idea of a divorce  which is terrifying to me  and we aren  39 t even at the point where people can  39 t communicate with each other yet. Once one side can  39 t see what the other side is actually saying all they will have is even more straw mans and misconceptions about one another. The government is fully controlled by Democrats at the moment so good luck hoping their opposition get a say in anything.  Everyone needs to leave twitter now. I know Parler and Gab are struggling at the moment  but one or both or something else will break through. It is going to be a mess for awhile. Hopefully this sub hangs on.  He only owns like 2  of Twitter. We are going after the wrong person.  Where is his real net worth   Square    deleted   Bruh...Dave Rubin isn t the subject of this post. He s replying to scumbag Jack.  Oh nvm then I don t understand anything about Twitter  Yay the only post I can comment on without a  flaired user  attached to it  It s hilarious to read the other post and comments about censorship when you guys do the same fucking thing. Whiny bitches  Something something private platform.  But my freedom of speech   Republicans are more worried about likes and followers rather than an attempted coup on the country. Treasonous bitches. You guys ask immigrants to speak the language and assimilate but yet I don t hear a word when you have a white supremacy bitch walking around inside the capital with a rebel flag.

Democrat politicians are so disgusting. They make everything they can about race. Terrible people who never should have power over anyone.   strong Disenfranchise  strong  is the word of the month.  People saw whistleblowers complaints  under table suitcases of ballots  counted without poll watchers  we saw 4 30am 140k votes for  quot D quot .

t3_ku466x,Joe Biden likens Ted Cruz to Nazi propagandist Goebbels for helping Trump spread big lie about election fraud,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku466x/joe_biden_likens_ted_cruz_to_nazi_propagandist/,HeALiNg  amp  uNiTY  You  39 re only included in this unity thing if you change your way of thought and accept society as to how  em they  em  want it to be. Other than that you  39 re just a white supremacist  nazi  domestic terrorist  boot licking  brainwashed snowflake that needs to be executed.  Says the man who eulogized a Klan member.  I will never understand why that s not more of a big deal.  It  39 s  D ifferent  That should be a shirt or some permutation of it.  Honestly  it should be. Hell  even kamala fucking harris brought this up in the primary. Before she  ya know  dropped the whole  quot joe  39 s an ex segregationist quot  angle and agreed to be his VP pick.   It was a DEBATE steven  maniacal laugh   Because he spent several decades of his life actively renouncing and apologizing for his past in the KKK  and spent much of his tenure as a politician voting for and supporting policies that would positively affect black people.  Yes  Democrats are very forgiving of Democrats.  Ted Kennedy murdered a woman and they forgave him before she was even buried.  You  39 re absolutely right. How could I have been so blind.   I think it takes a bit more than an apology for being a recruiter for a terrorist group that raped  tortured  and murdered black people for over a century.   In 1964  Byrd led a filibuster against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He also opposed the Voting Rights Act of 1965  as well as most of the anti poverty programs of President Lyndon Johnson s Great Society initiative.   In fairness the Johnson Great Society initiative is a collection of some of the worst legislation our country has ever had introduced.    But apparently I learned that the NAACP apparently didn t support the 1964 and 1965 civil rights acts.  The thought is more a critique of the Democrats  39  hypocrisy in canceling anyone and everyone on the right who said the tiniest thing they don  39 t like 30  years ago  but they can forgive their own people who change  no big deal.   He denounced them when they became inconvenient not before  Neat. Now see how any Republican in the same situation would be treated.   Several Republicans were permanently forced out of office for not denouncing Robert Byrd hard enough.  And while he may have disavowed the people who started his political career  he never disavowed the policies they supported.    If you hold someone to the Left  39 s standards  then  em you  em  have the Left  39 s standards. How are you not able to see that    And this is why we  39 re here. Keep taking the high road you  39 ll eventually see where that gets you.  Nothing the Democrats did or want to do positively affects black people or any other type of people  except politicians and insiders .  And the KKK was founded and run by Democrats.  Byrd actually used his kkk connections to jumpstart his political career as a Democrat  and while making ritual denunciations for the wider audience  never changed his voter base.  Because it wasn  39 t Donald Trump that eulogized a klan member....  And said if  desegregation happens we are all going to be living in a jungle.  de  Oops yes you are correct. Desegregation. Thanks for catching that   lmao they ve already moved to calling other republicans  literally Hitler  and Trump isn t even out of office yet.  He keeps calling people nazis. Hey joe  this ain t it.  Unity sup TM  sup   That is actually seriously super insulting and offensive to the Holocaust survivors that are still out there. Joseph Goebbels was a sick  evil son of a bitch who was partly responsible for the murder of millions of  innocent loved ones.   They have run out of things to compare to. Once it got worse than  literally worse than hitler satan  there s nowhere else to go really. It s sad how much they hate. Trump Derangement Syndrome is a real thing.  Yep exactly. It  39 s a horrible and insulting comparison.  If it  39 s a big lie  conduct an investigation. Let  39 s do a thorough audit. Remove any doubt.  This.

Oh how our dystopian novelists of the past  Huxley  Orwell  Rand  etc. got it all too eerily correct...  That s a crazy interesting comment to put into perspective. I m willing to bet we ll be the closest to an authoritarian nightmare as you can possibly get. America isn t built for the upcoming factions...  Betting that things will be worse seems to be where the smart money is at the moment.   Excess deaths have been historically normal since July or so.   quot Covid quot  deaths may see a huge surge  but total deaths are the same now as they  39 ve ever been.

He wasn  39 t talking about what the Nazis did.  The man of unity...   I will be a president for red states and blue states  no matter who you voted for   Joe Biden   Funny  he looks every day closer to Josef Stalin  in how he conspires with his close circle on ways to make anything that makes him uncomfortable  quot dissappear quot .  He never sniffed little girls.  More like chernenko  a sickly enfeebled place holder put into power by shadowy desperate actors to prevent reformers empowered under andropov from continuing.  Joe Biden is a traitor  Don t worry.  Give him a few seconds before he completely forgot what he said...  The funny thing is  I haven t seen him look like the feeble idiot he was looking like back in October. Now  I have no idea if this is intentional media suppression  I mean  obviously they are not going to allow him to look bad   or if there s a chance of the feeble old man act was a charade  Since the election is over  he can limit his media appearances. Biden has suffered a mental decline over the past decade or so  but it  39 s only really apparent when he  39 s caught off guard.   I just said the same thing yesterday  I think they finally fine tuned the cocktail of drugs hes on.  Plenty of pharmaceutical jacking this dude up...   We should you unite guys    I  39 ve seen the things Cruz has written over the past 2 months  and Trump style  quot rigged election quot  rhetoric ain  39 t it. He was demanding a commission to investigate the claims formally  which  after the unmitigated disaster that was Giuliani  39 s and Sydney Powell  39 s circus  should have been an easy demand for both parties to make just to put to bed the unrest. You don  39 t quash fears of illigitimacy by telling people to f  39  off.  Man  it did not take long for the world to enter full swing dystopia. I want off this wild ride  No. We need to take our country back. This is much bigger than any election.  I watched the fraud happen live on election night and then again during the Georgia runoffs.  I don  39 t need Trump  Ted Cruz or anybody else to tell me what I can clearly see with my own eyes.  Obiden is a feeble  senile old pedophile that the Liberals are controlling like a puppet on strings.  And by doing so he shows who he fears in 2024  Following up a speech about lies with a disgusting lie is so Joe Biden.  Interesting how he has been doing just that for months. Democrat Privilege.  Not spreading lies when you re telling the truth.  To date not a single audit has taken place on the election.  We have 99.9  more evidence than we had in 2018 when we started impeachment on trump for a single whistleblower.   Now we ve had tens of them along with hundreds of affidavits  massive statistical anomalies and of course all that pesky video proof.  Don  39 t they know the more they talk about it the more people are going to start questioning if it  39 s true   He  39 s out of his basement. Nothing can hold them back.. They will just pour it on now...   deleted   I just searched for  quot Pence quot  on Twitter. Don  39 t. Just don  39 t. It  39 s a shit show.  Why    If anyone is the reincarnation of Goebbels....its Biden.  I  39 d say Zuckerberg and Dorsey are more like Goebbels. They  39 re the propaganda arm  after all.  Fair enough   Nice bit of defamation there biden  Important  If you are iPhone the way you stop Apple from deleting Parler from you phone is   Lol that s rich coming from anyone on the left.   When we make apt comparisons to hitler about their actions and beliefs they invoke Godwin s law   He  Fucktadred elect  is already demonizing his competition for the 2024 election.  With biden being silent on the censorship of conservative voices he  39 s just accusing others of what  39 s he  39 s guilty of himself. Supporting efforts that are far more nazi communist than any Cruz has said or done.  The most disheartening thing about the election is the media s lack of interest in the fraud. If the allegations are false  show us don t tell us. In 2016  NPR actually tried to find  fake news.  So why won t they do some investigative journalism now   Afraid of what they might find. Same thing with Hunter Bidens laptop when journalists legit said its not their job to investigate things.   a href  https   youtu.be fNQAbF33gFM  rel  nofollow  https   youtu.be fNQAbF33gFM  a 
t3_ktyrpe,Twitter Banned At Least 60K Conservative Accounts,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ktyrpe/twitter_banned_at_least_60k_conservative_accounts/,While this kind of censoring is happening  people still act like Trump is the sole reason why the US is in such a divided state.  Trump was only ever an effect.  Yep. I know two conservatives who were banned this week. They just  like  and retweeted conservative tweets. Buckle up everyone.  It wont stop at banning people on twitter  facebook  etc.  It will get to banning and suing any site or person with opposing views  just watch.  Already happening.  Look at how Apple and Google are deplatforming Parler.  Watch the  quot hate speech quot  laws that are coming to prevent that. Calling it now.  They are trying to get tv providers to drop Fox News now too  It will he websites next  the cancel people will start harassing web host sites to remove anyone they don t like.  Amazon web services is no longer hosting Parlor  They  39 re going to bring back  quot net neutrality quot  because  you know  they have to protect the inventivness of the internet.  The internet is decentralized. Android ppl are side loading parler fwiw.  I  39 m surprised they haven  39 t created a web interface.  there are some blockchain based social media sites.  I am looking at steemit currently.  I wish more people spoke up when YouTube banned Anwar Al Awlaki videos  which they did after Republicans pressured Google .  Time to move to 4chan  It s scary how many people are supporting the destruction of freedom of speech.  I have a trans friend who is stupidly against freedom of speech like she doesn  39 t understand that it is freedom of speech that allowed her to be a her publicly now without getting attacked for it or whatever. Of course she thinks she gets attacked all the time and actually never has been... She told me that when Trump was elected that roving bands of anti trans we  39 re going to come for her.   YOu sHUt uP nOw   Its freedom from your kind of speech.     And Reddit is along for the ride .  They  39 ve successfully redefined  quot inciting violence quot  to mean disagreeing with them in any way  Twitter when politicians journalists and half the Democrat party excuses or blatently riots destroying lives   I sleep   Make this and post it EVERYWHERE YOU CAN message me and I ll upvote all of them.  They have already redefined conservatives as racist  sexist  bigoted  homophobic  fascist  neo nazi  white suprematists. Therefore  any word they utter is hate speech.  They already said that was  quot hate speech. quot   Tp be fair  disagreement with the left usually ends in violence  by them to us   When you tear out a man  39 s tongue  you are not proving him a liar  you  39 re only telling the world that you fear what he might say.    removed   They wouldn t want to start a civil war  all the conservatives have the guns  Never underestimate someone.  They have been buying guns at a record pace this year.  Not to mention  they control almost all forms of communication.   removed   They won t because it s their mirror reflection. It s the same people.  Some of them won  39 t be woke enough or say the wrong thing  and boom banishment.  The purity test comes for all. I saw this in real time earlier  people arguing the economics of victim hood when it came to China  39 s recent post about uiygurs. They couldn  39 t decide if its worse for uiygurs or minorities in America...  Are you kidding me      No.  The lack of self awareness and the hyperbole of self entitlement.  How the fuck are minorities worse off in American then the Muslim Chinese  Reality isnt their strong suit. The only question is whether we accept the ones who get the axe once censorship comes for them.  Depends if they wake up. But once a useful idiot... always a useful idiot  Give it time.  Liberals are a bunch of sheep following billionaires.  Even if racists are being censored  and by and large these aren  39 t those cases  but I  39 ll humor the argument for a moment.... Would they really rather racists have the opportunity to ban together in solidarity and force them to gather in the shadows rather than in the open where everyone with half a brain can see them for the moronic hate mongers that they are   R politics is a cesspool   removed   Just become the conservative version of ANTIfA  Social media outlets have no right to decide what constitutes racism. It baffles me that people don t grasp that. Social media outlets are not courts  and they don t grant due process. The only reason this stuff should be able to happen is if someone broke the law  which can be determined only after due process. That should not be controversial.  I  39 m pretty sure they would want free speech gone at this point. Any one remember  quot free speech is hate speech quot     There s a Reddit  crisis line  fucking LOL   deleted    Takes a long drag from cigarette ..... you couldn t handle her son....  The direct message people are the definition of loser. They  39 re hilarious to engage. They have no thoughts of their own.  You re giving them too much credit. They ll never get banned because they can t think for themselves. Many of them will likely believe whatever they re told to believe  If history is any indicator you are right  Maoist China . They will never exercise all of the their demons  the left will continue to move the line to remove people that don  39 t fit their ever shifting mold.  The amount of injustice in the world takes a negative logarithmic shape. The supply of actual bigots continually diminishes  so the woke mob must tighten the noose of acceptable behavior to satiate their desire for self gratification. This is why the left eats itself.  Stop sounding so smart. Jk very eloquently stated  It would be a shame if all 60k of those people sued twitter.  Except thanks to section 230  it would go nowhere.  Thanks for nothing GOP   LOL   An angry Twitter employee sent me a message.  They re pathetic   Please copy and paste the text. I d love to hear what the soyboy  or girl  said    Unfortunately  when I was given the option to accept or ignore  I hit ignore.  So I don t have the message saved.  But the gist of it was them quoting my OP  then writing  HAHAHA   Good thing we can afford the best lawyers.   I think the play is someone needs to sue Twitter for defamation. They ll use section 230 as a defence  saying they re not a publisher. The counterpoint will then be showing all their moderation   censorship actions and argue that section 230 doesn t apply to them.  I don  39 t see how a case like that could possibly make it into court.  I don  39 t think you understand how 230 actually works or what it provides. It doesn  39 t protect them from repercussions for allowing them to choose what content is allowed on their platform. It is actually the reverse  it protects them from liability for what IS posted on their platform. These are all services provided by private businesses in a free market  they can choose what to do and have those freedoms to do so. This is a core tenet of small government  free market conservatism.  Sued them for what  It  39 s a private company they can do whatever they want.   removed   They are a platform not a publisher. Platforms don  39 t ban people for political reasons because like the town square or the phone company  they are not held accountable for what is said there.  Private companies are not above the law. They cannot discriminate against people and suppress free speech. Like any other business that needs to follow the laws.  If this sub wasn  39 t already established  it would  39 ve been gone in a matter of months. It  39 s only a matter of time till they come for this sub. Enjoy it while it lasts. Social media is a disease and getting censored might ironically improve many people  39 s lives.  This sub is my last political sub in subscription. If this happens  i do not have to do anything. I will be automatically cancelled as a political user.  Serious question where the hell we gonna go with this is gone  I ve tried discord but it s not organized into coherent threads. Guess I m an old man now but seriously we need somewhere to convey truth.  I asked myself this exact question earlier and came to the conclusion that the right either fights for their right to exist in the same space as the left  or we make our own platforms which are always at the risk of getting removed. I wholeheartedly believe that this sub isn  39 t gonna last for much longer  after that lord knows where conservatives can go. Not  a href   r politics  r politics  a   that  39 s for sure.   deleted   Of course they did.... Mass censorship... But it  39 s only ok if they do it...  And only if it happens to us  Social media is cancerous  Let them destroy their platform. Conservatives are productive members of society. Advertisers will follow the money to other platforms.  What other platforms. I don  39 t what to have a to have a   39 conservative only  39  or   39 liberal only  39  sites  that will cause people to become absolutely intolerant of anyone who doesn  39 t think like them. I get not having people who are doing illegal things  but I don  39 t believe that  39 s the real reason anyone is being banned. It  39 s purely  quot because we don  39 t want you to have a voice quot   and THAT should be illegal.  I hate to say it but advertising targets left minded people. Uneducated consumers who overpay for stupid shit by and far have left leaning mindsets.  70mil people are a huge demographic. We ve learned to swallow left targeted advertising  so they don t think they have to appeal to us.  Just deleted my account.  You should all do the same.  Just did an hour ago and not regretting it  5 minutes ago  I hardly used it anyways but I surely don t want them to be able to count me as one of their users.  I was one of them.  I guess I should feel honored.  And what terrible and evil thing did you do  Fess up...  What sickens me is all of the  quot republicans quot  still blaming trump and condemning things that weren  39 t wrong. for instance people who just simply attended the rally are having to apologize  step down from positions  etc.... even if they didn  39 t do anything violent or enter the building etc.... All the dumb republicans going right along with it need to be voted out.  At some level trump has to be aware of the winds out there and the information seems to be that he doesn  39 t know the pulse of what  39 s going on.  I knew this was possible.  You just had to look at thedonald to know it was possible.  Generally  I  39 m a fan when that website was being good but tossing treason flags at everybody is bad.  The rolling rally part  that  39 s good... but man the wheels came off.  At some level I don  39 t blame their frustration levels  I really do... but the states did jack all and you expect some savior moment if you zerg rush the capital   That ain  39 t happening.  Lin Wood ain  39 t delivering documents from a chariot from heaven.  I support the right of private companies to choose with whom they do business. The argument that the company is large or popular enough that it should be deemed a  quot Public Space Square quot  doesn  39 t sound very conservative at all. Sounds a lot more like what socialist countries do  nationalize private business and put them under state control.  Or the fact that 3 of the 4 biggest tech companies just killed off the competition for the other members of the elite club.  That is monopolistic.  That is antitrust law territory.  While I believe the government often needs to keep their hands off they made this monster.  They gave them more protections.  These companies are the new Ma Bells.  I agree. I think they are a company  thus they have the right to host not host whatever content as they please.  Do you realize that you  39 re missing the point  This was a coordinated effort by the biggest names in the tech world to silence and shut down competition. They  39 re literally strong arming businesses out of their market share. And people are willingly jumping off that cliff to support this.   removed    removed   Yeah. New pictures have been dropping. More to come.  We are at war. Have you ever listened to Steve Bannon  39 s war room   Lmfao. He s literally a pedo crackhead who sold Russian and Chinese access to his father  the now president elect and CNN cried Russia and wonders why we don t take MSM news seriously.   links please   If Trump had truly lost  none of this would be happening.  Oh look at all the awards for this great news.  It  39 s always wonderful to see censorship in action.  Praise be to our tech overlords.  It s time for American s to ban Twitter.  Safe to say Freedom of speech doesn  39 t exist anymore  They didn  39 t ban my account. Must not be conservative enough. Or maybe it  39 s because I only have 82 followers.  Xi  Biden cultural revolution is here  I just don  39 t see this as censorship.  These are private corporations.  They can pick and choose who they do business with.  Important  If you are iPhone the way you stop Apple from deleting Parler from you phone is   Only 88 million more users to purge... This might not be a sustainable business model  Jokes on them  I banned myself first. Account deleted.  Don  39 t comment in this thread. Reddit will be next.  Global technocrat elite don  39 t want critical thinkers with differing ideas and that  39 s obvious.  I guess they re now a publisher.   removed   That  39 s kind of an insult to parasites.  This is so ridiculous. If we can get this under control now  there will be no limit to who they cannot ban. Trump is the most powerful person in the free world and they have banned him  Do not become dependent on any particular social media platform or online forum. Especially this one. Be ready to have to look for new locations online to have any discussions that would be considered wrongthink. In fact you should already have found some by now. If you depend on anything too much  it will be too hard to figure out how to do without it when the choice not to use it is no longer yours.  The whole thing is to cause panic and avoid conservatives spreading hunters laptop drops.  This just proves that they ve been planning this all along.  Mine was one of them.

Don  39 t. Just don  39 t. It  39 s a shit show.  There is no rational reason to go on Twitter... ever.  It  39 s a bunch of seething TDS  39 ers calling for the public execution of Donald Trump.  If you don  39 t have mental health issues  spend an hour on Twitter and afterwards  you will.  Twitter remains the single best way to keep up with breaking news. It  39 s inherent to the structure of the platform where everyday citizens can read and see tweets in real time as opposed to waiting for full articles to be written after the fact. It  39 s full of bullshit and people I don  39 t ideologically agree with  but when real shit is going down you  39 ll find out breaking information from twitter first before any other source.  Yep. They can literally call for Donald Trump  39 s death but how dare you ask for free and fair elections    Some users were quick to point out that the trending item was not due to fresh threats  but rather that users were circulating a video from the Wednesday riot at the U.S. Capitol.  Using their own logic  Doesn t matter  Users were using Twitter to spread violence. They need to be deplatformed  Are we all missing the bigger point here  Trump is such a narcissist that he threw Pence  his loyal right hand man  under the bus and put Pence s life in danger. Trump knew Pence cant change the votes and used Pence as the fall guy.  No amount of loyalty to trump is ever enough. If you aren t willing to completely beclown yourself  Giuliani style  he will eventually throw you under the bus.  Or if you attempt a violent coup and fail  trump will throw you under the bus. This is what he does. To him  there are two kinds of people. Those who can be useful to him  and the scum of the earth.  Agree  So many things   Let s be really clear. A slightly different chain of events yesterday  and some of these terrorists may have gotten to Pence. He was rooms away from a dude with zip ties asking where mike pence was.    What I  39 m trying to understand is how was the security this soft to even allow even the slightest chance of anything happening  Like  quot a guy with zipties quot  was allowed to be a perceived threat against the second in command of the most powerful country in Earth  Wasn  39 t zip tie man unarmed  Where was the secret service  Hell where was any security even amounting to what you see at a concert venue or something. Wtf  Trump is a lying  bullying  narcissist snake. I voted for Trump and gave him a pass on peddling lies about mass fraud thinking he was just trying to save face. I cant believe he would go this far to throw Pence under the bus.  Reminder that Twitter and other social media is not representative of the real world  But Trump gets banned for inciting violence   Brigaders coming down hard on this tiny thread  It s not like they have anything better to do with their lives   removed   Its only bad if conservatives do it. Otherwise threats of violence and doxxing are not only allowed  they are encouraged.  The people chanting this were trump supporters.  I doubt that.  You think the people waving trump flags and storming the capitol chanting  hang mike pence  are on the left   Source  Because i didint hear or see people chanting  quot hang mike pence quot  during that shitshow.  Lol Fox News  Because they have been such a bastion of truth....  Are you seriously incapable of clicking the hyperlinked part of the article that takes you to a video  aka a primary source  No wonder you re unable to defend your points and choose to deny reality instead.  Some people just refuse any information that conflicts with their pre established conclusions.  Then actually prove it was the left. So far there has been zero proof that it was anyone other than Trump supporters.   What I don  39 t get is why conservatives absolutely MUST have a psychopathic narcissist to advance the conservative agenda  Is the Republican Party so devoid of honorable people that trump is the only way  I don  39 t believe that.  It isn  39 t that  they are being ignored by both parties  and only one party allows for gun rights and is anti censorship  in terms of only political speech   the otherside is anti gun rights and is pro censorship  in terms of political speech.   This is the true story of this past year.  Looks like years to come as well  Dems in control  time to get away with everything. Dems will protect them as long as they are on the same side.  And big tech just sits by with this obvious hypocrisy. Per usual. There are rules for democrats who hate trump  and then their are rules for us.  Important  If you are iPhone the way you stop Apple from deleting Parler from you phone is   And Twitter bans everyone that says this is violence.  Parler APK version here..... Bypass Play Store   DM  me if you  39 re still having trouble. You may need to scroll partially down and get Version V2.6.9... Happy to help if needed.

t3_kuevx6,Amazon cuts off Parlers web hosting following Apple Google bans,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kuevx6/amazon_cuts_off_parlers_web_hosting_following/,Anyone have an article of other reference to the specific posts that are causing the bans.  All news articles i have seen done site anything specific.  The readership of Arstechnica is in favor of this move   foolish and shortsighted. They re conflating those who call for violence with everyone else who uses parlor.  Yes. Once they go to central bank digital currency  they will be able to manipulate your bank account directly.  They ll probably only allow grocery transactions. The social credit score in action.  You give them too much credit.  Scary times for 1st amendment  What does this have to do with the first amendment   Let me help you understand something.  A total free market is anarcho capitalism.  If that isn t becoming obvious to you now and you re still not seeing a problem with this then I m not sure how else to explain it.  The Constitution should reach beyond just the government.  The constitution limits what the government can do to its citizens  not what citizens can do to each other.  I think apple  google  and Amazon are wrong to deplatform parler but bringing the first amendment into the argument isn t the right strategy.    What happens when large multinationals work closely with political parties to coordinate in a way that maximizes profit and power for both. Does the multinational still count as a private citizen  free to suppress who they will  or should we begin to consider tightly coupled public private entities differently   This is  a href   r Conservative  rel  nofollow  r Conservative  a   not  a href   r Libertarian  rel  nofollow  r Libertarian  a .

Cutting off channels to a select group trying to speak freely is the same as stripping the first amendment from them.  Everyone has the right to free speech in the US.  The  right to refuse service  cannot override this.  Take a look at the rights to be heard during the civil rights movements.

Considering the first decade of his career was essentially blackface comedy  I m surprised he isn t cancelled already.  It  39 s  D ifferent for him  maybe the left need to be reminded or informed of that.  Or he does and doesn t want to be eaten first.  I don  39 t think so.

They will get around to him eventually.   deleted   Bake my cake bigot     Oh how i would love for farmers to boycott importing to liberal cities  or truckers to boycott delivering to them  Well  truckers did refuse to deliver while Democrats were allowing rioters to loot and burn with impunity.  Since Democrats have a history of dragging truck drivers into the street and beating them to death.  Yes   Treat them to their own medicine to have them experience how evil they are.  This would be awesome.  If America is to move forward then this undoubtedly must happen. Farmers must withold their produce from blue states. Truckers must refuse to deliver goods to liberal cities. Small businesses have the right to refuse business and deny gainful employment to any Democrat. Many talk of a coming Civil War but economic sanctions first and foremost can avoid the violence that war would bring  Amazing how people are so happy to throw away their rights because it is against someone they don t like. Until it starts affecting them  but it ll be too late.  Thats the thing. They don  39 t think they  39 re taking away their rights. What they  39 re excited about is our rights being stripped from us while they get to keep all of theirs.

It s about preventing Trump from standing again. They re obviously not stupid and know it wasn t an insurrection but a riot made worse by the capital police dropping the ball   they re pushing this narrative to sell the impeachment. I won t be surprised if behind the scenes many of the republicans in the senate at least want them to do it.  Why wait 100 days  Begin impeachment proceedings  strong against Biden  strong  the day he takes office.  No no  they ll 25th amendment him just after 2 years so kamala can serve 10 years  Start impeaching her too.  These people are insane.  It  39 s a waste of time in my view. If you want Trump to settle down go the next 10 days  squeezing him in a corner is the last thing you want to do..  It  39 s like they  39 ve never read any history books. This is literally the situation Julius Caesar was in. The Senate wanted to prosecute him for all manner of crimes  real and imagined  while Pompey tried everything he could to get him an escape plan. His only rational option was to cross the river Rubicon.  Stop wasting my money  Half of it went overseas and now they want to spend it on Trumps impeachment as a treat to all of us Americans.  I wanna see Dave Ramsey get drunk and go over the US spending budget.   Unite   Impeach a man no longer in office  What  They are terrified he will run again in 2024. They just don  39 t get it  they are projecting their hated of us  regular plain working Americans  onto Trump. It  39 s us they hate  he is just our ambassador in Washington.          I just don t get it. There s so many other things they could focus on.. but they want to waste our Money and time on that shit..  What would be the point of impeaching Donald Trump after he leaves office   I know there s a lot of talk  but he s not going to run for president in 2024.  I m sure he ll endorse someone  but he s not going to put himself through that again.  I understand  even if I think it s ridiculous  impeaching him now.  But once Joe Biden is sworn in President Trump is NO LONGER president.  What would impeachment even do   It  39 s about sending a message. They hate anyone not aligned with the establishment.

Trump wasn  39 t too vile to associate with during his presidency up until now even though people were slinging dangerous terms like  quot Nazi quot  around back then too. It  39 s just a convenient time to pretend you want nothing to do with him.  I am an old lady. I never thought that America would become a country that weaponized freedom of thought.  You ain t old if you were born in 66. But yes it has become the  thing to do.   If you are the right your thoughts are evil and must be stopped. All the more to know that we are on the right side of history and propaganda and Braine asking from the left is just going to get worse. Be prepared for a fight. As they won t stop here.

I m told Ben Sasse is a putz  With Senators like Ben  who needs democrats   I mean  they literally called the federal agents stoping riots stormtroopers and didn  39 t apologize.  The left doesn t truly know or want to know history. When they saw stormtroopers they thought Star Wars.  I  39 m so sick of this bs working on people  You have conservatives here in compete denial.  Sounds about right given his  we love you video   Yes he was clearly singling out the hundreds breaking into the Capitol  now you know the tens of thousands outside protesting peacefully.  Same excuse as Charlottesville then   Why is this upvoted   Probably because people  myself included  are frustrated of trump s inability to call out and condemn his supporters who say or do bad things. Instead he gives a confusing statement that allowed his opponents to argue these statements are actually supporting the bad behavior. His  we love you  video was a great example. If you watch the entire video he s basically saying the rioters were justified and then says to go home. Not good enough. That video is what made me lose faith in him.  How did he say the rioters were justified exactly   Here s the transcript   I didn  39 t think there was anything wrong with that speech. Majority of the people inside the Capitol didn  39 t even do anything  that  39 s a fairly appropriate response. I also feel a little sympathy despite not accepting what they did.

It s political  his state really fucked up the election and he s trying to deflect the heat.  He s retiring in 2022.  You re correct  I was just counting the term years from his last election.  I ve edited my comment to remove reference to re election.  Thank fucking god  he s such a piece of shit senator anyway. I m so ready to MAYBE have the chance to vote in an anti establishment guy. But knowing the PA republicans  there s a fat chance of that. The politics of my state are way too fucked up. They didn t throw their weight behind Scott Wagner  and now we re stuck with Furher Wolf who doesn t get near as much bad press as he deserves.  This massive attack against Trump is just to remind the population that if you are not a political insider  you are not allowed to run for President.  And if you dare to vote for an outsider  you ll be punished.   deleted   PA is controlled by Philadelphia. The only republicans that come out of New England are RINOs  Sad but true. Its disgusting how that one mess of a city controls the entire state.  We have a few good ones at the state level.  Unfortunately we have a few areas that are quite crowded and known for corruption.  Kinda kills it for the rest of us.  They  39 re so eager to impeach him when his term should expire in less than 2 weeks  doesn  39 t that feel a bit off   Of they vote to impeach him again he cannot run for president again.  That s not true. Unless he is convicted by the Senate  being impeached means nothing.  He has already been impeached. He wasn  39 t removed from office. The senates job is to convict and remove from office. An impeachment is just an indictment not a conviction..  In 4 years they probably won  39 t have a pandemic to use for rigging an election.  This will prevent him from being eligible.  You re underestimating how far Democrat s are willing to go to rig an election.  Trumps best quality is his ability to get people to remove their masks.  Weve seen it from the left  and now were seeing it from the fraudulent right.  Hah that s a joke. Toomey is so corrupt.  Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey ... what happened to that poor guy   No one knows or remembers.   One day he was in office.  Next election he was just gone....we heard he had just 1 vote.   Oh that poor man  what s his name again   Pat something.. Pat Romney   I think he s not seeking re election.    Go figure  And pelosi didnt commit treason   She tried to start a military coup  When  She went to the joint chiefs and tried to have them take his power away.  Basically  asking for a military  coup. They told her no because  of that  Lmao. What a piece of shit  I hope you mean her  Of course  Exactly. Treason.  I still dont see what Trump said in his speech that is impeachable or led to what occurred.  He could have not even made a speech and they were going to blame him.   That  39 s what it comes down to.  This is what I came here to say  too. I watched the entire speech live on air and heard nothing wrong  except normal Trump rambling . I think it s BS he called Pence a coward  but maybe that s just me.   He did and said nothing. They are terrified that he will declassify documents which will show their crimes.  Didn t Trump call him a RINO recently  Sounds like wittle Toomey s feewings were hurt.   removed   Toomey has hated Trump all along. Fuck him.  The Deep State really wants Trump to never be able to run again. Gotta protect the swamp at all costs.

They have proven american and the court systems don  39 t care about cheating to get into office and we are destined for many years to come democratic control. These are the end times for the constitutional republic we all learned to love.   em top  em  republican...  As opposed to a bottom Republican like Lindsey Graham.  Toomey is a RINO cuck and always has been. I m disgusted that he represents the conservatives of my state.  Being   You are looking pretty small at this moment. Put the shovel down.

Glad to be enlightened.  Get a DE safety razor and save a ton of money. A handle costs no more than a Gilette handle.

Ditto Snapchat  which basically exists for underage people to send nudes to one another  and everyone knows this...    Personally I don  39 t like the tag that Parler is  quot conservative quot .  I would hope that free speech and protection of free exchange of ideas would be a non partisan issue.  What  39 s even scarier is how many people on the left think they  39 re so woke and yet totally blind to the corporate control that they claim to be against.  Narrator  it isn t.  That s just not true about Snap anymore. In the past it was definitely a major selling point of the app  and even subtlety advertised as such  but at this point the app has many other larger draws.  I think the point being made is Parlor is being removed due to  lack of moderation  yet a LOT of platforms have a REAL lack of moderation and things like child porn get posted to the platform all the time unchecked  Reddit  Twitter  Snapchat  yet the apps will continue to get to operate because liberals.  The thing is parlor is not even conservative. It  39 s been around for a few years and didn  39 t start out political. Everyone and anyone can go on parlor and they do. Conservatives have been flocking to it as of late however because of the censorship going on with the arrest of social media.  Being a pedophile isn t as bad as being conservative these days. Pretty fucked up.  Many of them call it pedosexual now. Fucking disgusting  Parler moderates  they post the rules and when users report rule breaking posts the Parler moderation team manually reviews the reported content. If it breaks ToS  which includes breaking US laws on non protected speech  such as incitement of violence  CP  unlawful threats  etc.     em as defined by our courts  em   then the content is removed and the user is warned or removed from the service.  Reddit has the right politics  Can  39 t have apps that actually believe in that pesky 1st amendment. Everyone must toe the uniparty narrative.  Apple is fine with children dying to mine materials to make their phones though.  All of this posturing by Google and especially Apple is all posturing. It  39 s the same as Nike decrying violence in the US as children labor in sweatshops. It  39 s a farce to get people to buy their products  1984  Social media blocking their competition before they can get popular.  One might call it collusion.  Only if one had a spine to enforce one  39 s call.  I call them scared that they might lose market share.

I bet they ll take action against them as well  s  Unreal.   It s funny they cite lack of moderation. In their terms of service they say you provide the content for you page and you take care of your own page. If you want to block or ban people who are causing issues  you do it.   That  39 s where we are at in the world right now.  THIS IS THEIR GOAL. This is exactly how they want people to think. Don t think for yourself  let the government think for you. Nothing you do can be wrong if it was approved by the government.  Ah yes  censorship  Moderation is the P.C. word for censorship. Users of Parler didn  39 t sign up for that. It  39 s about the free flow of ideas whatever they are.  Moderation  You mean patriots refusing to conform to extreme left wing propaganda.  Big tech  We need to have unity  Whoa   deleted   At this point they are driving the fuel tanker straight into the flame.  In this new digital age  to protect our 1A rights  either Facebook and Twitter need to be free speech platforms. Or the government needs to make their own and make it illegal to take anything down.

I m sorry but some of the people on Parler are nut jobs  they deserve the right to speak but I also have the right to say they are crazy  Sounds like an apple boycott coming....  They banned it because they re totalitarian fascists.  I updated my iPhone settings so it won t delete apps I already have installed with updates.  I disabled automatic updates after Reddit forced that stupid  virtue signaling BLM icon.  Thanks for the tip.  Where do you do this   Settings   gt  screen time   gt  content and privacy restrictions  gt  iTunes and App Store purchases   gt  deleting apps   gt  don t allow  Yikes.  I guess I don t really need a MacBook Pro... gonna get the cheapest iPhone I can find too... fuck big tech and fuck these billionaires and the politicians bent over for them. I m starting to understand why the nazis were able to gain support pre WWII.  So Epic Games really IS the good guy 
t3_kvbcrh,State Department has Donald Trumps term ending today,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvbcrh/state_department_has_donald_trumps_term_ending/,Another one of these posts  There already been 20. I ll say it again loud and clear. Both Pence s page and Trump s page state this. News agencies  namely liberal Buzzfeed  came out and said that this was done by a disgruntled staffer.  It  39 s a disgruntled staffer. They need to be brought up on charges.  Lol one of my Trump hating co workers was all giddy about it today.  Its interesting but I dont see Trump giving up.  How do these emotionally stunted children get jobs like this in the first place. Disgruntled  more like a temper tantrum.  Why do they even hire these staffers   404  Yeah I don  39 t even get to the page
t3_kvcl3z,The 51st State Washington Revisits an Uphill Cause With New Fervor,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvcl3z/the_51st_state_washington_revisits_an_uphill/,And Puerto Rico.  That will be two bunches of easy Electoral votes for Dems every cycle  along with new additions to Senate and Congress.  Great....  On a surface level  yeah add more states. Cause  thats what we need when we can t even keep the same constitutional standards across states that we already have.  You can resolve that problem of representation by assigning all residents of DC belonging to either Virginia or Maryland.  Ohhh I think these states will want their land back  All of the land that was originally Virginia  essentially Arlington and Alexandria  was ceded back to Virginia in 1846. While I agree the the best solution would be to shrink the actual district to just include the federal building around the mall  both the Maryland government and many citizens groups in the district have said they do not want the land ceded to Maryland.  If DC is granted statehood...then California should be allowed to split into two states. One Conservative and one loony leftist.  As a member of Commifornia  I agree with you 100  and I would be moving to the Conservative part.  Wonderful   Same with Oregon and Washington  Ore  amp  Wash state should merge into one state. Called Northern California. Then split down the middle north to south. The eastern part could then be absorbed by Idaho.  They  39 d just encourage migration from the left side to the right side to flip it left.  Scary but possible. We would have to  em build a wall  em  to maintain our independence.  ...and so it begins    Never will they get the 38 states behind it.  What could be worse then allowing election fraud to push mandates   The only way dc becomes a state is an amendment we ll be fine

t3_ktw3mn,Twitter allows Hang Mike Pence to trend hours after Trump ban,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ktw3mn/twitter_allows_hang_mike_pence_to_trend_hours/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  https   discord.gg conservative  a   Twitter should be banned for inciting violence  I heard Apple and Google are removing the apps from their respective stores  s  Repeal 230 please  The Useless and pathetic GOP overturned Trumps veto just to keep section 230  and take away Trumps ability to remove troops from the Middle East   Useless and pathetic is the best way to describe the GOP right now. Its going to be almost impossible to get control of the narrative with big tech social media in control.  The the only thing that will fix these issues is lawsuits.  If only they could get sued over this without a government protection.  Yes   removed   Although to be fair  the  quot hang Mike pence quot  slogan was uttered by pro Trump protestors. And there are pictures of them setting up a gallow. That  39 s very unsettling.  But they let it stay up despite being extremely violent  It doesn t matter who all posted it   Twitter should have banned them all for inciting violence.  I never supported or excused the behavior of those involved in the capital riot.  I m just pointing out the hypocrisy of people and organizations that are selectively outraged and excuse violence or threats of violence that they agree with.  Big tech companies control the flow of our communication  and they are clearly demonstrating their selective censorship.  Context does matter. If the reason that it is trending is because people are talking about the fact that some people went to the capitol building and said those words   then yeah  let if trend. People should know that happened. It  39 s horrible  and twitter shouldn  39 t hide reality.   What a surprise...  Isn  39 t it trump supporters screaming that   It doesn t matter who s saying it m  Twitter should of took it down.  Fuck Twatter  Twitter said they had taken corrective action.  Fuck twitter pos website  Isn t the bigger story that people were rushing the Capitol building  with the VPOTUS in it  chanting to kill him  We can talk about twitter and all. But Trump literally turned on Pence  called him a coward  while stoking this angry mob.   I think they are both important take aways.  Trump fucked up big time. And the big tech companies  39  responses are also big fuck ups. It  39 s just shit all the way around unfortunately.  Because Trump is gone. Their monopoly isn t.  You have  em no  em  foresight do you   Censorship by big tech and the media is exactly why we ended up with a mob of angry trump supporters storming the Capitol in the first place. More censorship is going to stoke those flames. I think it s a pretty important takeaway  personally.  Big tech abusing their monopoly like power to control free communication is a huge issue.  It s the new MySpace.    Only a matter of time  Not fair to bring MySpace down to their level  When will y all realize this has nothing to do with a logical reason to ban Trump    Rules for thee and not for me .  Can we go back to walls being racist   When you realize Twitter bans based off of political beliefs and not actual policies.  So its time to ban 58k people if they  39 re going to be consistent about their own rules  Can we just stop giving a shit about twitter in general now  It  39 s such a cesspool.  How long do you think a tweet like that would last if it said Kamala Harris instead of Pence   It would ve been to taken down before it even got put up  Wait why Mike Pence  I thought he was now a  savior  to the left since he disagreed with Trump  The insurrection rioters were chanting this in the white house. its trump followers not the left who started this  Oh wow  ok  Apparently it was right wingers who started it. But its bs to pretend all ideologues on Twitter weren  39 t joining in...  Goodbye twitter  you suck. Cancelled early this morning.  Were all about anti violence here at twitter  Twitter is the ultimate shithole  Twitter is a hot mess right now and so is everyone using it. I don  39 t have it but if you do I suggest deleting it for a week until the initial madness or the ignorant fizzles out  Yeah but those posting it aren  39 t the POTUS.   deleted   I really think this is a violation of the law and Jack Dorsey needs to be arrested for allowing his platform be used as a means to threaten the life of a vice president. THis man is a fucking criminal and needs to be charged .  That s the rub   if Twitter is a  platform   he gets legal protection from what other people post  but then he has to allow diverse political opinions.   Since Twitter is picking and choosing what they like  they re acting as a  publisher  so they shouldn t get legal protection.
t3_ku5rwm,Amazon cuts off Parlers web hosting following Apple Google bans,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku5rwm/amazon_cuts_off_parlers_web_hosting_following/,This is just a quid pro quo between big tech and the democrats. Democrats get their opponents censored  meanwhile big tech gets to remove their competition and the Dems promise to leave them alone.  We re witnessing the death of the American republic in real time  It  39 s scary and it  39 s much faster than I ever feared.  It started back in the late 1960 s. Some of us have been watching it creep slowly over the years. The leftists just have more power now because the GOP after Reagan turned into wimps and started out Dem the Democrats.  Trump forced their hand. Better this than a slow boil.  People of America NOW KNOW.  This is true.   Watchung the left cheer this shit on online is even scarier. I didn  39 t want to understand what it had to be like in the purges of China  USSR  and the nazis.   removed   The damn we need to be better people are screwed and are such an issue  Just cancelled my prime membership and will close the whole account if they follow through.  BOYCOTT THEM and all the other Sellouts  This is honestly getting insane.  Cancel prime  The fact that these billion dollar corporations feel so confident to brazenly do this is really scary. They know they will have no repercussions for silencing mainstream conservative figures and creating a chilling effect for anyone not radically left.   In the future this will be asked  Where were you the day free speech died on 10th January 2021    Well thats before the Constitution Restoration then came and leftism in America was gone.  It took 48 hours from its removal from the play store to its total shutdown. Big tech came in and said if you thought you could find free speech on your own you were wrong.  Did they state that a specific TOS was violated in order to do this ban   I mean  this is insane..  How can this be legal   Coup completed  On orders from Xi Jinping....

t3_ku76c0,Parler could be SHUTDOWN from midnight Sunday after Amazon warned it would shut its servers off,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku76c0/parler_could_be_shutdown_from_midnight_sunday/, em Got banned  em        Watching everyone declare they re finally cancelling their Amazon Prime accounts as well as suggest moving to ebay to make online purchases has me quite confused to be frank. One of my biggest concerns through the pandemic has been how to help small businesses during shutdowns. That s been a talking point all over this sub as well  especially as lockdown has driven margins for Amazon even more sky high than before. But alas i find it intriguing that so many here obviously did nothing to  em use the free market  em  for the benefit of the things they vehemently claim is important to them  small businesses   but instead let the free market use them.   Everyone has a line. This just happened to be it for many.  I only ever use Amazon if I can  39 t find what I want in the store. I  39 m super old school and like walking into a store and picking up what I need. I hate ordering things online and having to wait for it to be mailed out.  The same logic applies to Parler  they didn  39 t have a backup plan for being canceled by a know left wing organization like Amazon. Same with the people that refused to transition from Twitter to Parler. And before you get all hung up on small businesses  where do you think small businesses get some of their products from  What about the self employed people that sell products on Amazon  So while it  39 s true that we did too little too late and that we need to support more local businesses we have to acknowledge that large businesses like Amazon exist for a reason  they provide services to more than just every day consumers. We need to organize efforts to get people unhooked from these left wing tech companies and media outlets.  Amazon helps small business a lot more than Walmart or other big box stores. Most the time when you shop on Amazon you  39 re actually buying from a small business. Even when it  39 s FBA. Just avoid buying  quot AmazonBasics quot  products because those are made in China and distributed solely through the Amazon system.  if you aren t comfortable masking up inside local businesses then just buy directly from small businesses online. Amazon takes a cut off the top even if it s the product of a small business with the promise of  faster shipping . Take the  6 hit and put more money in the hands of people in your community and less in the hands of Jeff Bezos  My small business sells on Amazon and we  39 ve increased our revenue significantly by using FBA  so I see  quot canceling Amazon quot  as something that will hurt people like me.   Were are watching the digital purge escalate dramatically. In just over 24 hours  the president was digitally unpersoned  millions of voices online were silenced  and millions of people are publicly calling for genocide. Including members of the government. And all you guys can think to say is  quot well  I guess I  39 ll cancel my subscription. quot   And what are you doing about it   Calling people out on their bullshit  researching whether running for state office is a good idea for me  and I  39 m ready to take more direct action if the opportunity presents itself. Like the other guy said  it  39 s not going to stay digital for long  we need to be ready to fight back.  We need a completely different digital setup for the conservatives. I have replaced many liberal apps on my phone.  People who think this is just digital are fooling themselves.   So how is this not a breach in contract between parler and AWS   AWS is claiming Parler is breaking their TOS by not censoring their users when if they call for violence  which means it is within Amazon  39 s right to terminate the contract.  lefties running coercing  courts    One less bill I guess  Color me surprised. Looks like my Prime subscription is def getting canceled. Was already considering it based on Bezos and the ineffectiveness of the service all last year but this seals the deal.  Just cancelled mine   Suck it Amazon.  Well now it s obvious it was completely planned out.  Not before Amazon can forward all of the patriots that are registered on the site to the 1619 project and the Lincoln project to be out in the list of supporters for trump.  Can boycott all you want  Amazon is still going to be around  and   most of the small businesses going out of business now anyway will force more people to use Amazon. It  39 s a delayed effect since there were the smallest amount of bankruptcies  ever in 2020  but once all the protections run out from COVID there will be mass bankruptcies  you will be forced to use the giant corporations that were able to stay open because Gov said so.  Amazon is going to piss off 75 million amazon customers. Good luck with that...  A lot of people have no idea this is going down. We are far more informed than most people. There are huge numbers of people who have no clue what parler even is.  Yup my family just canceled our prime membership  I m going to shop more on eBay.  I noticed many resellers on amazon are also on eBay.  Same.  Just cancelled mine.  Done.  Man... Mine was still running on the student  cheapo version too even though I graduated a year ago.  Damnit... Cancelled.  No one is cancelling  Any ideas on how the cancellation refund works  My prime renewed a few months back  wondering how much they ll stiff me for cancelling now.  If they don  39 t give you the refund on your first request they will eventually if you continue to contact them.  They  39 ll probably try and stiff you for the full price. You can always try doing a charge back and dispute the charge with your credit card company though if they won  39 t give a pro rated refund.  Generally you  39 re cancellation takes effect when the service would run out.  If you want a refund you  39 ll have to go through their CS.  Which.... Not that good.  It  39 s fantastic for package returns  at least in my experience.  But for memberships... Not a clue.  I  39 ve dealt with AWS and they are atrocious.  Amazon committing suicide  Looks like I will be buying local. No more Amazon.  If you are a conservative  don  39 t use Amazon for your web hosting.  They could disrupt and disarm your business on a dime.  Get out of your house and go shopping at your local stores. Novel idea. Right  I  39 m not talking Wal Mart either  Rebuild America.  Thankfully I live in a very small town  1300 pop   and local business is the best way to get anything  as long as you can find it in stock. Which most of the time you can  if not they order it and two days later they have it for you.  No business in my town or the next town over  2300 pop  have been shut down. I will always support local small businesses over big retailers if I can and I know most of these communities feel the same. Beeter business  better people and its the neighborly thing to do.  There s other web hosting services out there  azure  but it s kind of hard to transition your apps services smoothly overnight.

t3_ku60yh,Free Speech Platform Gab Reports 750 Increase in Traffic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku60yh/free_speech_platform_gab_reports_750_increase_in/,Yeah. Servers are currently undergoing maintenance as I speak. I believe this maintenance involves adding even more servers to handle the exponentially increased user total.  Most of alt tech is racing to buy servers.  Minds  Gab  Rumble  Parler  they  39 re all getting massive spikes in people.  And next the ISPs will claim they are violating their policies and will shut them down as well.    I believe Gab has their own server infrastructure  so while their growth has been incredibly slow  big tech will have a hard time shutting them down.  The point is the ISPs and the other infrastructure providers will be next.  That is what just happened in Hong Kong.    Why   Gab hasn t had an app in a long time. They had all this happen to them a couple of years ago after the synagogue shooting. After that they built their own infrastructure so they can t be deplatformed by companies like Amazon. That s also why it s really hard to get on right now. They ve had to order and install more servers to handle the extra traffic.  Good. I can deal with the reality of them needing time to scale up. Ill join them.  Nice to see they have some resistance to deplatforming  They  39 ve been several steps ahead for the past couple of years just by using plain common sense. What happened to Parler should have been easily predicted.  I was blown away that parler was using aws. I  39 m an idiot for assuming they wouldn  39 t make a huge error like that.  Amazon is gone from this household. GONE  I have 2 shares in Amazon and 2 more in alphabet. Think I will get rid of them  There is no app that can hide from apple and Google  if it  39 s removed from the app store it  39 s all over. You  39 d need billions and billions of Capitol just to compete. Google would attack you  it would take 10 years or so. Were all fucked.  Then again  on android you could download the app straight off the internet and install it.  Well Gab isn t an app anymore. They ve streamlined their code so the site runs better on your phones web browser.  So wait  Apple and Google are banning Parler because they  refuse to moderate  and risk inciting violence  yet they also won t allow gab app on their stores even though they DO moderate against violence and comply with their guidelines. So what s the common denominator here other than free speech social media   Control.  Monopoly  Decades of political refusal to take all kinds of monopolies seriously is really coming to bit us in the ass.  I saw that Gab CEO is releasing a Gabphone  It s a pixel without anything google and improved security as well as a different OS. Sounds interesting.  Pinephone runs Linux and is open source iirc.  This is what s gonna happen. Free market thinkers will find a market. I hope it happens dinner rather than later.  Free market wanters just gotta wake up and get their asses off Facebook and Twitter for it to work.  I m hoping Elon makes a move.  He s got so much at stake though. If anybody would put principle against profit its him. But his life  39 s ambition is Tesla and SpaceX he  39 d risk throwing that all away  right at the point where they are achieving his dreams if he too openly went against our new overlords  Personally I hope it happens breakfast rather than later.  Hope it happens  quot dinner quot      Yep. Sunday barbecue and all  That phone will sell like hot cakes. I  39 d be in  that  39 s a no brainer.  Make a Parler. Make a Gab. Parler is in a fight to stay alive right now  while Gab has it  39 s own servers. Parler is more popular right now  Gab is more secure.  Guess we know what the next target of the authoritarian left is.  They ve already been after the CEO he s banned on both app stores and his family is blacklisted from VISA apparently  Takes time to expand infrastructure ...  Expect them to.  Gab run off of the mastodon platform if I recall  which can be distributed. Can t stop the signal.  Yeah it wouldn t even load for me  I can tell they got that much more traffic  Gab was just removed from the apple store  Gab has  em never  em  had an app in the apple store.  I was wrong about that. Someone told me to sign up and get it in the App Store. Saw it wasn t there and thought it was removed. Sorry about that.  They had an app  There wasn t one yesterday on the App Store.  Pretty sure they haven  39 t had an app for a long time. Its web based and streamlined for mobile use   removed   It s impressive that gab is surging without an app... is it wishful thinking to imagine a world where smartphones held a little looser grip on society  Something about it being on you all the time... it s chilling to me. Cant we just do some things on a laptop at home    Annnnnnnnnd it  39 s gone. Google play deleted it  it  39 s all gone.  Hmm.. Still up and working for me.  Just use the website.  Annnnnnnnnd it  39 s gone. Deleted by AWS.

And talking about blaming and whining about everything is rich from a liberal. That s what you ve guys been doing for 4 years strait  daily.

You got an extra chromosome or something bud  Just calm down and take a deep breath. Its not a wiener don  39 t take it so hard.

Everyone will be forced to choose which side they will take.  It s the Republican party  not the conservatives. Most republicans are so spineless and corrupt that they ll bend over and backstab you to keep their titles and money. I say screw them all  screw Romney  Murkowski  the whole Bush family  Graham  and any other spineless republicans. I m a conservative before a republican  and it s time that all real conservative republicans ditch this party and start a real grassroots movement party.  I second that.  The problem is the people voting. They keep voting in the same idiots that don  39 t do anything productive or useful.  Hank Johnson   dem  After seeing all the shit that went down in 2020  and  em again  em  in the Georgia run offs  I  39 m not sure anyone is actually voting for these people.  I agree 100 . Just on getting stimulus money to people that need they have failed miserably.    I thought that was going to be the tea party  small government pro freedom conservatives. I still wonder occasionally what happened to them. That s the wing of the party I identify with more than establishment Rs  Honestly  They made Sarah Palin one of the leading figures of their movement  and it was a big mistake. She just didn t have the chops  intellectually  personally  or politically  to carry the Tea Party forward and the movement died on her back.     Character assassinated by the leftist news.  What happened to them you ask  They became Trump supporters  the ones that go to those rallies are the same people that were the tea party.  Enjoy handing all power to the democratic party for a generation. Face it  the GOP has you over a barrel. Abandoning them is no different than voting Democrat  because in effect that is what you are doing.   Conservative movement I  39 m not so sure.  Republican party  yeah.  I don  39 t know what you mean by this or how it relates to murkowski.   Trump movement is nationalistic  not conservative. He used the Republican Party as a vehicle  then trashed it into a lake when it didn t serve him any longer. He has set back conservative policy making by decades. Our saving grace is an improved Supreme Court. That s it.  Lol... Tea Party movement  would like to have a word with you. The GOP establishment fucks conservatives not anti establishment outsiders. Ron Paul was a libertarian conservative that used the GOP as a vessel to energize his base  Trump is a populist  nationalist that used the GOP. The last Republican conservative that actually won the presidency was Reagan and then Bush Sr abandoned Reagan conservatism and gave us Clinton and Bush jr. Trump injected new life into the GOP and gave conservatives a platform to fight back. Trump was never a conservative  thatbwas never his contribution to the GOP  your entire point is a strawman.  Nah the choice is between conservatives and Donald Trump versus the Republicans. Unless you think Murkowski is a stalwart conservative.  Not OP  and I have been nervous about saying this on this sub for the past couple of years  but I don t actually think Donald Trump is a conservative.      Trump himself is not conservative  he is still a largely conservative president by almost any standard. I don t agree with your definition of social conservatism  but hey agree to disagree.   deleted   Let her go. Time to primary a lot of these swamp  Republicans   Sarah Palin threated to Primary her in 2022 a few months ago.  Murkowski has lost a primary and won a write in. She  39 s not going anywhere  Palin needs to return to the cause and get it done.  Yeah  more swamp  that  39 s what we need.    I d rather Palin in there than this fraud we currently have.  You  39 d rather have Palin  the person who was running mate with legendary RINO John McCain  than literally any other challenger  No thanks.  She s not perfect but she s better than Murkowski as far as I can tell.  That  39 s not better  that  39 s just different.  If there s someone better who can get it done I d support that person.  Murkowski inherited her seat from her father. She did nothing to earn it.  Plain has supported Trump more often than Murkowski.  As opposed to the supposed non swamp that is proving to be the swamp  such as Cruz and eyepatch guy   Ranked choice top 4 in Alaska  she  39 s good. Murkowski lost her primary in 2010 and won a write in. Literally nothing will take her out  The Republican Party is dead. They can t stand on a message or principles. They tossed Trump under the bus in the end. I for one don t care about Murkowski. She s already gone. And you can t count on her to vote for anything important anyway.  Trump threw himself under the bus.  Voting to  object  to the certification was mathematically impossible from the start  considering that the the Democrats have the majority in the house.    People on here are so fucking short  sighted. Imagine what would happen if the parties were reversed. A Democrat incumbent refuses to concede and demands Congress overturn the election. Analyze the evidence the Trump team has put forth and ask yourself if a Democrat brought that forth  would you support them staying in office  The Trump team hasn  39 t actually claimed voter fraud in court more than a few hundred votes here and there  not nearly enough to overturn the results. By their own admission they aren  39 t even claiming they won in actual fact. They simply want millions of admittedly real votes thrown out on a technicality.   I ve come to realize that a TON of people  left or right  don t actually care about  democracy  as they claim.  It s nothing more than a talking point   they would welcome a monarchy so long as it aligned with their views.  Agreed. It  39 s because everybody thinks in terms of now with no regard for the future. Let  39 s say you have a guy you really like who  39 d make a  em great  em  king. Great. Not unprecedented. What happens when he dies though  What if his kid is a complete moron who drives the country into the ground  No recourse  sorry  you  39 re just gonna have to suffer until he dies. Want to change it before  That takes a high stakes violent revolution.   Just because Trump does Trump doesn t give the R s free reign to abandon. Regardless how you feel about the D s  they stick together. One can condemn Trump and even his words while at the same time maintaining that the Capitol nonsense wasn t his fault  and support impeachment  25th Amendment  or resignation.   Just a lot worse than I thought.  Can Romney and Sasse follow her   As a Nebraska native  fuck Ben Sasse.  She  39 s not a republican  No  but she voted for Republican leadership  which like it or not does matter.   Control of the Senate lies in the majority leader  39 s hands.  that  39 s committee control as well as the legislative agenda.  In a closely split Senate  a Murkowski could decide whether the Republicans get to do anything at all or if only liberal bills get to the floor.  Toodles then.  Probably was just looking for a reason to board the dark star.  We need to shun the RNC.  Let them fall.  We have to rebuild.  We can  39 t keep using the same avenues.  And if anyone thinks that this would just result in total control for Dems forever  there is precedent that shows it might not. When the Republican Party was founded in 1854 with abolition as its primary separating issue from the Whig party  the vote split gave Democrats a 66  majority in both houses and a win in the 1856 presidential election. However  the election of 1860 turned the tide  as Republicans took control of both houses and installed the first Republican President  Abraham Lincoln.   Exactly this. Everyone understands what s going on. It was true then and it is true today. Gut the GOP and create a new party that has a party constitution that does not allow for RINO style players.  She is smart. She knows that most of the spineless republicans who turned their backs on Trump will get torn apart soon by the vicious wolves in the democrat party. She decided to joint the pack.  In other words her personal hatred is so much she  39 s willing to turn the back on the supporters who elected her through a  em write in campaign  em  just to make herself feel better.  Aren t she and Romney the biggest RINOs in the senate  This doesn t really surprise me. But hey  go join the Dems even though they didn t condemn any violent riots over the summer.  Mittens can go with her. They already have the senate for all practical purposes  Ok  bye.  If she wants to join this democrat party  she was never a conservative  Would anyone notice   Fucking why   orange man  perhaps orange man not as bad as you purport   Lisa Murkowski to Alaskans   Fuck you    she has always been a traitor  We needed the two Georgia seats to make the Senate Romney proof  but apparently also Murkowski proof.  That  39 s why the race was doomed to fail   Republicans have lost faith in the party as a whole and it has very little to do with Trump. I don  39 t give a shit at this point  any politician that denounces Trump or supports more status quo bullshit isn  39 t getting vote. They can eat shit. I voted for Bush  McCain and Romney.. never again.  Don t let the door hit you on the way out.  The big question is whether they have 50 votes to take out the filibuster  and it  39 s not clear to me with defections that they do.  Murkowski even as a Dem would be highly unlikely to vote to remove it.  So long as it remains  the difference between 50 democrats and 59 is irrelevant.  Don t they need 60 votes to remove filibuster   No it  39 s basically a taboo that keeps the filibuster in place  minimum is 50 votes to get rid of it but that would be a real escalation  Right the problem with getting rid of it is that if the Right gets in power they would use it against the Left.  See Harry Reids removal of the Filibuster for judicial nominees vs McConnell doing the same for SCOTUS.   If the Republican Party has become nothing more than the party of Trump  I sincerely question whether this is the party for me  she said.    For someone as desperate to hold onto power as she is  not sure what kind of clout or authority shes going to have in a party that sees her years as a Republican as irredeemable complicity.  Nothing would meaningfully change  Leave she is as republican as democrat anyway  Good riddance. Leave now.  Oh no. Anyway  We need a law to prevent this kind of BS. If you were elected under a specific party and want to switch after the elections a new electoral process should be held in place to ensure proper political party representation.  Does she think people are voting for her  They are voting for Republican Party. Trump is the only one who can claim people are voting for him.  Can t fault the woman  the CCP money must feel real good when the Chinese pour it all over you.  Easy to take money when you don t have a soul or moral compass.   deleted   Traitor.  Good riddance. She s a goddamn RINO anyway  and it s not like republicans have the balls to get shit done with the majority as it is. Weakness.  Whether she  officially  leaves or doesn t leave is irrelevant at this point   she votes democrat all the time anyway  and Schumer is already speaker.  It  39 s like switching shirts for these people  so who the fuck even cares.  They  39 ll be expelled anyway so only Democrats will be represented.  She might   Thought she already had.  Ah...another traitor.  What a shocker. She  39 s one of the squishy RINOs anyway. If she goes  no great loss.  What would change if she left gop  Presumably if she really held moderate conservative values she would still reject packing scotus  ending filibuster.
t3_ku8wa3,Amazon Boots Parler Off Web Hosting Service,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku8wa3/amazon_boots_parler_off_web_hosting_service/,Here is a perspective many have overlooked  these purges of conservatives by social media reveals a long overdue truth that conservatives must learn. Republicans cannot expect to campaign and govern via social media when those very platforms are run by people who wish you dead. Just as it was blessedly ruled that the devout are under no obligation to bake cakes for gay patrons  so too do these private companies have the right to deny service to those they oppose.  Colorado v Masterpiece Cakes was a very narrow ruling which exempts artists from being forced to create art that they don t want to.  That is a very different thing.  Sounds a bit like you re saying create a second America.  There are already two Americas  It s certainly headed in that direction.  Or at the very least a second internet. What do conservatives do when ICANN won t issue them IP addresses due to  harmful content    Easy  now create the financial and tech infrastructure to support your platform.   While this is true we still have to do something. Our biggest bargaining chip is our money. We have to start somewhere.  Yes we do  but how do you proceed  Boycotts will not work alone.  Boycotts combined with investing and spending money locally and spending money patronizing business that share common interests in opposing censorship is a good start.  And distribute on what hardware exactly  Do they make their own phones to run the software   Not yet. But the demand may be there and where there  39 s demand  there are always people who are entrepreneurial enough to step in and meet that demand.  Exactly. It s time to stop consuming products from companies that think of you as a piece of trash. What self respecting person would do that  I understand that we don t have as many options today because we are all trapped in a situation of our own making. We trusted these leftists and thought that these are just intellectual differences. Turns out that they don t think of you as their intellectual equivalent.  What needs to happen is people supporting conservative type and owned businesses over the easy route of Amazon and others.  Exactly. We need a Constitution for conservative businesses. For example  no censorship should be one of its rules and any business that breaks it needs to be kicked out of the club.  That baker doesn t own a large share of the baking industry whereas these social media companies in fact own large sections of the social media industry. You re overlooking important facts.  Doesnt change anything. We put ourselves in a reliant position on big tech and now it  39 s coming back to bite us. I  39 ve been social media free for over 10 years. I  39 ve never understood why conservatives support the linkes of FB  Twitter  etc...  I don t use those either. However  this is the purpose of anti trust legislation because some companies will get very big and powerful.  Insane  Guess it s just a matter of time before this sub gets censored too.   No we wont. We don t peddle stop the steal  release the kraken  QAnnon bullshit here.  Ohh my sweet summer child.  Oh ok they  39 ll surely leave us alone then.  You think it matters at all what anyone says here other than  conservative    Moderate apparently means clueless. Like I have said  spread your cheeks and smile  surely they will use lube this time.

The headline alone is a smack in the face of service men and women who have sacrificed for us.  Elections are the embodiment of the Constitution on the tangible and personal level. If the Constitution is now now worthy of personal sacrifice  we have lied to servicemen for decades and the country is truly dead.  The fuck is this Commie bull shit  You are a joke and your paper is a joke.  I mean  considering elections determine almost every aspect of our lives  I d say they re worth sacrificing a lot for  So the freedom to be governed by the people that we choose to put in office is less important than living our day to day life  How can we live our day to day life if those in power put laws in place that take away the life that we enjoy  How can we live our life if those that we duly elect are withheld from being in those positions due to fraud and unconstitutional laws   Paywall.

What does it matter if we all know  They get away with it and we all just make frown faces and carry on.  Impeachment for dementia.   That will surely stick when Biden won t even remember his own name.  So many are cheering it on though   that s an ominous sign of how badly America is decaying.  She looks more and more like a clown every day. I mean  she legitimately looks like John Wayne Gacy in his clown costume.

Shocking.  The Chron is  em not  em  a  quot major player quot . They  39 re a shitrag  and their editorial board is even less useful than that.  LOL  leftists can STFU and fuck off.  I know people have lost their minds over the Capitol Protest and as a result our democracy is in great peril and question right now  but perhaps the citizens of Texas should decide Senator Cruz s fate in 2024 and not the media  I know that s probably a radical suggestion.  How dare Democrats speak of  political opportunism . They have been acting despicably since the events transpired. They are treating this incident in the same way the Nazis treated the Reichstag Fire.   This is Biden s repeat the lie often enough and it becomes the accepted  truth .  Cruz  39 s objection to counting the electoral votes was not because he was convinced there was fraud on a scale large enough to flip the 2020 election but to perform an audit over 10 days to convince Americans that such large scale fraud  em didn  39 t change the election.  em   Exactly   and that tells you everything.  You don  39 t need to memorize every detail of every grievance linked to every state.

Because the idiot legislature gave cuomo all the power back in March  It  39 s like freaking darth sidious  Compare this idiot trying to personally dictate a vaccine rollout  the inevitable shit results  and the lack of media coverage  not to mention killing thousands of seniors  to DeSantis in Florida who rolled it out by allowing doctors  hospitals  and health care networks manager it  you know the actual professionals  and in turn he is ambushed by CNN journalists trying to attack this plan.   deleted   Because they don t want covid to go away. It s a perfect excuse to trample people s rights and shut down churches.  Including 2 groups that weren  39 t included in phase 1A would have easily used up this amount of vaccine  those over 75 and ALL health care frontline workers.  This is what gov run healthcare will be like.  a href   r politics  r politics  a   I  39 m a disabled vet and I laugh at anyone who wants public healthcare  they can  39 t even get it right for the small percentage that has served our country.

SIR SIR  dripping with condescension  we are working on it  literally does fucking nothing  goes back to crossword puzzle.  I know some folks who do a  em lot  em  of EEO law against the VA.  Their admins are downright evil  incompetent rats.  They will destroy the careers of good doctors for their own bureaucratic gain  and they never fire the despicable people who have cost the country millions.  I fucking believe it. The rats that are hired sit there and condescend to you  and treat you like garbage most of the time.   The hospital in Tampa is pretty good in terms of actual care  but ya the admin staff is awful. I don  39 t even bother half the time because I know if I call for anything I  39 m looking at an appointment 3 6 months away.  Same for me  I can  39 t wait six months for care. It  39 s insanity. People who want a free ride on the government have no idea how bad the quality of that ride is going to be.  Being in the military myself I  39 ve long since learned that nobody takes care of me like I take care of me. It  39 s sad for all the people who have  more or less have themselves to rely upon for care down the road because of the ineptitude of government health care. That  39 s why I save 26  of my pay  because who knows what the fuck it  39 s gonna look like in 40 years.  Ya  nothing like waiting 6 months for a simple appointment. I  39 d pay for private insurance of if could afford it. The  quot affordable quot  care act made sure it was unaffordable though.  Good thing trump solved alot of those issues though.  Right... I wish  but doubt it will ever be fixed.  Like every president says...  I was told by a leftist on here that there was no danger of that happening when I warned them.  Some guy told me that national healthcare was free as well  because you dont have to pay at the point of service.  When I pointed out things like doctors and medicine cost money  and have to be paid for through increased taxation  he said it was ok  because everyone could get much more healthcare out of the system than they paid for in tax.  So socialized medicine is like a perpetual motion machine.  And somehow it will be Trump  39 s fault.

The problem is cuomo bashing trump for his plan and then suing because he didn t like the responses he got and then turning around a fucking it all up anyways.  Cuomo bashing trump is low hanging political fruit  and to be expected. The issue is government inefficiency and incompetence on both sides of the aisle and failing their citizens.  Yea I know and I m not disagreeing. I m just saying that it s being pointed out because of the circumstances that led up to this. It s not news because of the results here. It s news because of what has been happening regarding the bashing and it absolutely should be called out.  You have to work at being as incompetent as Cuomo. He s fucked to every step of the way re  Covid. And because we live in a world where dunking on Trump is more important than saving lives he s been showered with praise for it.  Still can t believe He has a effing book about how well he did with his response to COVID.  He really is trying to kill everyone in that state isnt he   Ah its okay.  Hes a media darling.  They love him.  You should be prosecuted for this. This is gross negligence honestly.  That boy is a totally and positively incompetent noddy.  Meanwhile in FL  DeSantis has been rolling at the vaccine as quickly as they can to hospitals and put a directive out there to make sure those 65 and older are the first to receive as they are the ones with the highest fatalities.  Free market good.  Government bureaucracy bad.  He wants it to get worse.   Don t give them vaccines if they re going to waste them  What a disgrace  more incompetence...  Holy shit this is ridiculous. There are plenty of people who do want the vaccine and probably cannot access it  and these materials are going to waste. And then this asshole demands more  What kind of fucked up universe are we living in right now.  His job should be on stage not ruling a state. What a    From the start our governments  39  response to the COVID 19 pandemic resembles a bunch of monkeys humping a football.  It ll all be blamed on Trump  Those nursing home patients you killed weren  39 t enough  eh Andrew   And he wants even more vaccines sent to his state...  If they make us get a card proving we got the vaccine  I know a guy  just saying....  He is such a pathetic loser  Can we arrest him   You  39 re telling me he let 66  of doses he was sent expire because of his phased plan.  The same crime of a Wisconsin pharmacist  but on a much larger scale.    Throw that shit in the gutter lol you  39 re an idiot or a brainwashed fool to take a rushed and experimental vaccine that doesn  39 t even prevent transmission.

The left is just running in circles to defeat their enemy. Integrity is a lot harder to master than virtue signaling.  It s the beginning of the end. Same thing happened in Cuba when Castro and his party controlled the radios and no one else s opinions could be heard.  I can t stand Twitter it s a giant anti Trump circlejerk it just annoys me to my core.  Unsure if I can comment on this. As a liberal  left leaning Brit  fairly sure I d vote Democrat across the board  I agree the Twitter management of this is slightly concerning  Ah  that uniquely British talent for understatement.  We re being gaslighted by not only social media and the MSM but now the president and vice president elect  I already get down voted more on this sub than on any other.  And except for a few brave redditors  there is little discussion left here either.  Just occasional conservative posts with 100 responses saying that biden is super awesome and we should hail the new socialism.  Biden is the most centrist milktoast option they could give you to appeal to middle ground people. Why the fuck do people keep calling him socialist. He can  39 t even see the end of his own nose past all the crime bills  blue dog war mongering and corporate funding. Socialism my fucking ass.  People worry he has dementia and is controlled by others.  That  39 s because he does and he is.  Have you read literally any of his policy. Such as in the first 100 days giving citizenship to 11 million illegal immigrants. His hard stance on guns wearing to ban all online sale of guns ammunition and attachments. His literally coalition with bernie to overhaul healthcare. His talks about free college. His want to re implement transpacific trade agreement that was to far left for even Bernie sanders. Should i go on. The man aint even close to moderate and there were others in the democratic party that are far more moderate than him  such as Tulsi Gabbard seemingly the only principled democrat that ran this election  and even she isnt very moderate.  Biden is an idiot with no self awareness or principles except for lust for power.  Grew up in Delaware with him as my senator.  He is not a socialist  but will 100  do whatever the socialists tell him to do.  I m not having children. Not giving leftists 1 more human to indoctrinate into thinking giving up everything to people who have grievances against them will bring them happiness. The left can rot out its base.  The day this sub dies  is the day I lose one of the only place where I can actually talk to others about my political view.  Find people you like add them on discord and just chat.  What s the first thing a dictator does  Media blackout. People s Republic of America. In 3 or 4 year this comment will put me in jail.  It  39 s also worth noting that 50 years ago  some on the Left busied themselves with bombmaking and assassination attempts.  The Weather Underground is still being promoted as heroic by the left to this day. They bombed the Capitol building.  One of their kids is the District Attorney for San Francisco.  This is the future  generation z will have to deal with the United States becoming more authoritarian and left wing. The only thing we can do is set an example for our kids  and hope the next generations fix the issues that are coming.  As someone who leans left  I peruse this subreddit specifically for these reasons. Feeding off one side leaves people uncultured and unwilling to find middle ground. I like to keep in check by seeing both sides and trying to find my own opinion. I know many people who feel this way but unfortunately extremists on both sides have made things hard     Only one side has the power to ban people and deplatform.  Hell even KommieHarris approved endorsed their antics  rioting ...   The smile on her face as she gleefully declared this terrifies me.

I can t believe that s the quote. He only said positive things. Wtf. I m just floored. How the fuck does this get the president banned    I thought Trump got removed from Twitter for inciting the violence  Is that his full tweet   He also posted a video calling for people to be peaceful and to go home.  Fucking A. I can t believe that s the quote. He only said positive things. Wtf.  Trump Derangement Syndrome.  Yes this tweet got him removed for inciting violence.  It  39 s tricky when you think 2   2   5  It s actually 22. Prove me wrong  There was zero inciting violence in his speech. I think what got him removed was suggesting that the election was stolen  But I may be wrong. I do know that I listened to his speech and there was nothing remotely deserving of a ban  even by their standards. But now they know that Dems control all aspects of government and social media  so there  39 s no fallback for doing what they want. Its free game on conservatives now. Every day that I  39 m not in jail for being conservative is a blessing.  Yeah  my understanding of the  quot rule violating quot  tweets is that he said the election was stolen amidst all the pleas to be civil and go home.  Praised his supporters.  The praise and the stolen election lines were concluded to be inciting violence.   Do we know how many people have died from the BLM  protests   I m sure plenty.   Jack Dorsey is a piece of shit.  Yes.  Also yahoo headline brags that hillary is trolling trump about twitter.... which just proves yet again the dems don  39 t care whatsoever about the capitol situation. They just care about childishly trolling trump and making up nonsense that he caused it.  The left are hypocrites  but do not care.  There were a lot of tweets about the riots that happened  Twitter isn t going to do anything about the tweets of the people who made them.  Anyone who  39 s not a brainwashed sheep is aware of the incredible hypocrisy on display here. This is par for the course for the Liberal media and politicians.  But they would never see it  They don t even want to consider the right be it moderately right or centred as anyone but a bigot. That s exactly how they get people to walk away from the bs  This is just blatant hypocrisy on twitters part. They need to ban anyone regardless of who they are if they incite violence  etc. same goes for Muslim extremists  alt right  leftists  CCP  be straight across the board when giving out the ban hammer. Just makes sense  There exists a plurality of American voters who are irreperably and happily corrupted by the poison of progressivism. You cannot debate with these people and you most certainly should not respect them as your  quot fellow quot  countrymen. A reckoning is needed regarding the complicity of both the conservatives and liberals in allowing this scourge to enter the mainstream and it is long overdue  You can t respect people that don t respect themselves.  I  member     I also like how they all of a sudden like the police after they have been saying defund they police for the last couple of months. They are so worried about the police that got killed now because it helps their narrative. When the LA police officers got shot out here in LA all they would post on politics was about that damn reporter and nothing about the actual cops that got shot in cold blood. I can t even blame them tho  when you have all of social media and the news telling you what to think you can t expect anything less.  Jack Dorsey  among other countless morons  does this hoping one day celebrity minorities will say  quot Oh look  he  39 s one of the good white people. quot    Edit  liberal minorities.  I stand corrected.......and in solidarity with folks like you.  As a minority I can 100  agree with what you ve said. Not all  but a huge group of leftist minorities will never be happy.  That feels racist...   removed   The rioting and arson by BLM and Antifa in Seattle has gone on nightly for MONTHS.  Mainstream and major social media are the propaganda wing of the Democratic Party  so they will ignore suppress any negative news regarding left wing violence and amplify any regarding right wing violence. We  39 ve known this was the case for a long time  that any right wing response was going to be met with non stop news and would give the left the  quot right quot  to become even more authoritarian. They wanted to trigger a right wing violent response over the summer  to be juxtaposed against the  quot virtuous quot  BLM marches   but it never really materialized in any large scale way.  Master Jack DOES live in a strange  strange world.  Lmao. And this one is active calls for violence  it isnt just twisting words and assuming what they say like the left does  Love when people praise Floyd  dude was a piece of shit. Violent criminal  not some hero to look up to.  But they are always going to believe they are on the right side of history.  Yea the left loves to reward violence  as long as its in support of their cause.  Rules for thee not for me  Yeah but Trump saying stop the violence is definitely inciting violence
t3_kvbn40,Thought I would update everyone on the state of Trump related subs. As you can see I have 12 communities in this custom feed. But only 8 are showing. Guess what the other 4 have in common. I then also searched for Trump and son of a buck.. The rest of the results pages follow suit...,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kvbn40/thought_i_would_update_everyone_on_the_state_of/,At this point there are probably a lot of card game subs also at risk of being deleted.  A leftist site owned by China is censoring non communist ideas. How shocking...  This sub is fine.....  For now it is  but I think it  39 s a na ve to assume this sub could not be placed under quarantine or outright banned at some point.  Never said that.. clearly you would like to assume moronic implications like this other dipshit. The entire point of this is the TRUMP name... Look at the other subs that AREN  39 T banned  ONLY the TRUMP ones...  Lol  someone is a little sensitive.  I don  39 t have patience for dumbasses.  Go easy on yourself.  You clearly haven  39 t been paying attention the last 6 months. And I would guess another 1 2 weeks before this sub is also banned.  Ok dipshit.. I don  39 t have the time nor the energy to argue about the obvious purge of conservatism from liberal media  but this specifically refers to TRUMP named and themed subs.  Sure thing snowflake. Lick that boot harder.  We will all be found guilty of  wrong think   inabsentia  very soon.   THEY KNOW WHERE I LIVE. COME AND FIND ME.
t3_kudtog,Biden Says He Will Defeat the NRA While in Office,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kudtog/biden_says_he_will_defeat_the_nra_while_in_office/,Accused rapist vows to disarm women.  Meaning the end of the 2nd amendment. And I believe it will happen.  It s only the end of the second amendment if people actually give back their guns.   The good thing is I can only imagine how many guns are floating around that never had ownership transferred after being sold private party. I know there s a BUNCH of them out there. Good luck fed bois.  I hope your not forced to find them...   Sorry  covid20 mutation. Too dangerous for me to come in with my guns  just do universal mail in license applications. I m sure everyone will be honest.  As did I  the wreck is undivable out in lake notyers  Well they are cutting off ways for conservatives to communicate and organize now.   Were you preparing for Normandie   They re already trying to pass laws that install registries for gun and ammo purchases with mandatory waiting periods for but guns or ammo.  Manchin won t vote for this shit  Im under the suspicion that 90  of the Republicans in Washington are RINOs.  They are going to come for your guns and as soon as someone physically pushes back the Republicans will come out and say  quot this is not who we are quot  and endorse taking your guns away. As far as I  39 m concerned these people cannot be relied on. A few yes  but the majority  no.  January 20th is a cold shower moment.  The whole Capitol thing was a setup. They tried to create a huge scene  but when it didn  39 t go the way they wanted they still pushed the narrative like it was a massive uprising.  I saw the videos of police officers opening the Capitol doors.  I  39 ve been reading a lot of viewpoints and you  39 re spot on. Have you seen the video of the shooting as a staged scene  At first I thought it was someone who did something stupid  but honestly it does look almost perfectly staged.  Thanks. I dont want to be spot on but I just cannot help it.  Haha the business end maybe  You mean like this   No thats a start...   is that before or after he cures cancer   Didn  39 t know the NRA was competing for office.  He  39 ll have to beat the NRA to it.  Bahaha most under rated comment of the day.  His efforts would be better spent defeating our illegal gun issue which has been terrorizing blue states.  Quick  everyone just started calling the nra an idea and he won  39 t do shit  Well... time to donate some more money to the NRA and other 2A groups   And while Biden is distracting us with this  he will be selling out America to China.  Fisting is illegal in some states...  Yes  we know China Biden hates the constitution if it doesn  39 t get him 10  of the bribes.  Text   That  39 s funny considering most of the violent gun crime is committed by BLM types and others in the black community. Likewise  illegal immigrant crime is also highly dependent on stolen firearms.    strong Whatever happened to just firing a shotgun out the back door   strong   The NRA better move out of NY and quit banking with Wells Fargo if they want a hope of survival.   removed   Not with the current Supreme Court  They  39 re packing the courts chief. SCOTUS cannot save you.  Do you actually think they ll actually pack  I don t think it ll end up happening.  Biden has already said he will set up a council for 180 days to bring him recommendations on restructuring the SC. Remember for a moment that the common belief among the left is that Trump packed the SC already so adding judges to  quot balance quot  the court would actually be  quot unpacking the court. quot  It is going to happen. At the very least  it will be strongly attempted. They have until 2022 at least without the right having a real say about it.  He also said he wasn t a fan of court packing and didn t want to turn the Supreme Court into political football. I m not defending Biden or anything. I want the SC to stay conservative more than anything  but I just don t see him doing something so radical. Even if Biden was on board  they would need the votes in the Senate as well.  51 votes  which I think they have after GA.  50   VP

Alright. Good for him. End of his career anyway may as well go out attending an inauguration.  I hear there s a nice lunch afterwards.  No no don t. Pence is done with politics after this anyway  Agree... and it sucks because I was looking forward for Pence in 2024...   Desantis 2024  Love Desantis but he needs to serve two terms as governor before he s ready for the national stage.  Trump had no govt experience and Obama was a jr senator. Why 2 terms  More time to get mired in the swamp. He s ready now.  Obama was a shit president and trump has a lifetime in the private sector  the two aren t comparable.  By the way he  39 s leading Florida through the pandemic and how he talks to the press  I  39 d say he  39 s ready now.  I agree  he ll be ready in 2024.  Exactly. Desantis reacts to the media like they are they are a pesky fly. He ll swat at them but at the end of the day they are nothing to him and he has bigger fish to fry. Trump was embarrassingly thin skinned around the media and the media freaking loved it.  He d be in his second term by 24   deleted   Love her but she needs to run for local office Congress first.

I thought lockdowns  riots all year long  a questionable election  and most of the other stuff that happened last year might wake some people up  but I guess not.  I fear you  39 re right and they  39 ll even have a harder time now  Dems control every level of government  control every single politician that was to hold their career  control bigtech  control hollywood and control the narrative.  Nah  fuck that guy.  They come for the guns next  Already are. Newly proposed bills to require a gun license for firearm purchases as well as ammunition purchases. Further  they proposed bills to require a gun registry.  Logic like this is why we re in the situation we re in.   BINGO. And I m probably the outlier here and considered a  conspiracy theorist   but I don t believe Biden is going to be sworn in. I really believe it s going to military tribunals...and then  four more years.  That is conspiracy  big time. Biden will be sworn in  the question then becomes how long until Kamala becomes president afterwards.   Lol  as I already stated  it s an unpopular opinion. I happen to think you re wrong. Never in my 39 years of life have I ever been a conspiracist. But look at where we are at now...who  in their right mind  would have believed all that s happening now    Pence has always been the model politician for behaviour to balance out Trump.  Swamp loves the swamp  He shouldn  39 t bother. It  39 s a big sham anyway and the Democrats are proving in spades that they can  39 t and won  39 t live in the same country with conservatives.  Hes just trying to save face. He knows his career is over  What a loser. Never voting for him  Of course he will. The man is a snake  thinking only of his own 2024 run.

But NJ hates those who follow the law.  Fellow NJ resident here.  NJ gun laws are absolutely draconian.  It s sad that we are so close to PA that actually allows their residents to exercise their constitutionally protected rights.  NJ is a trash heap in so many ways.  It s becoming unlivable.  I have a feeling that PA will face some more restrictions in the near future as well. Just a feeling  This is still some typical  rules for thee  bullshit.

Democrats with power are going to use that power to silence the voices of opposition. The msm is already in their pocket and will justify this theft of free speech. What other freedoms do they intend to rob us of in our best interest  of course.  s  It s just more of the same.  All the  Tech Giants  just want a giant echo chamber to scream their leftist wackjob beliefs into.  No decent  no other opinions  no speech unless it s the  right kind  of speech.  I hope their companies and profits wither and die.  I hope new businesses rise and put them out.  Really  I hope their 230 protections get yanked.  There is no point in them having it at this point.  Amazon sucks now anyway. They are slow on deliveries  half their products are wrong missing when delivered  and their customer service absolutely sucks. They act like nothing is their problem. We need to focus on American products regardless if they cost more to purchase. We need to break away  from everything that is China.  I ll say that Amazon sucks as executives  but I think you re wrong about everything else. There s a reason they dominate their market...  Maybe i just kept getting the short end of the stick. I quit using them 6 months ago. Anything i need or want  i search for a product that is made in the U.S.A. Yes  they have dominated their market  but we might want to start changing that.

t3_ku7tns,Seven out of 10 Trump voters OPPOSED storming of the US Capitol by MAGA mob  but they still want the president to finish out his term and not be impeached survey finds,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku7tns/seven_out_of_10_trump_voters_opposed_storming_of/,What the left isn t admitting   99.999  of Trump voters had nothing to do with the capitol building protest.  say 100   out of 75 million    0.99999866   99.999866  None. I understand being upset with our elected officials but quite frankly those who got violent and breached the capital are not welcome in conservative communities.  They are not.  Instill don  39 t see where Trump can be blamed for what happened.  And I  39 m pissed off that the GOP isn  39 t standing up for him.  Nothing in his speech said go storm the Capitol.  I  39 ve read and heard actual dangerous rhetoric from Dems and our media.  If anything I blame Rudy for stoking the fire more when he straight up said trial by combat like WTF Rudy could you have picked a worse choice of words  If you put on your tinfoil hat the  quot riot quot  seems like a setup. The cops just move out of the way and let all the protestors in to the building. The cops even seem to be encouraging the protestors at times.   Woah man where s the overblown hyperbole like the media what you to believe   It would be like wasting a huge amount of tax dollars to try to fire the guy who  39 s got less then 2 weeks left... and it will amount to nothing in the end this time as well.  I think the idea is to get it through the House now  and convict him in the Senate after the new Senate starts. This would make Trump ineligible to hold federal office.  This shows exactly why the democrats should not have control right now. When your motivation is vengeance not logic and reason no good will come of it.  This has been the past 4 years and they re not even in power  it s going to get worst. They hate Trump more than they care about their constituents.  Trump tried to drain the swamp  and now the swamp is trying to punish him for it. That  39 s what this gas always been.

I know they were angry at GOP  but look at what Dems are doing after they also got senate. It might be the end of our democracy.  It doesn  39 t really matter what you do  say  or believe. Currently  the radical left is just frothing at the mouth to destroy  em everyone  em  who isn  39 t affiliated with them.  Their own hatred will be their destruction.  a few dozen kranks doing what the vast majority did not.  I feel like those seven will change their mind once they realize what congress just did.  Will anything come of this though  Sure fucking hope so  Those 7 don  39 t understand what is at stake at the moment.

But the tech firms double standards are absurd.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ktt8q3/why_is_twitter_censoring_trump_but_not_the_ccp_no/,Looking for debate  Head to the public sections of our discord instead.  a href  https   discord.gg conservative  rel  nofollow  https   discord.gg conservative  a   The leader of Iran  a terrorist country  has been calling for violence to Americans for months. And he still has a Twitter account but DJT  a sitting President  does not.   He literally tweeted for the elimination of Israel a few months ago.  Twitter still allows Dr. Mahathir Mohamad to post  even though he once posted   iTs JuSt SaBeR RaTtLiNg  I guess he  39 s still mad about the Battle of Tours.  It sounds like the problem isn  39 t that Trump was censored  it  39 s that these other accounts aren  39 t censored. Just like you can  39 t go on TV and call for your supporters to kill people  you shouldn  39 t be able to incite violence via social media. No matter who you are.   The problem is the inconsistent way in which the rules are applied. It  39 s obvious the rules only apply to conservatives  so conservatives should in turn vote with our pocketbooks  so to speak  and not use their site. Hitting these companies financially is the only way to they  39 ll change.  Now you see how we feel about the criminal justice system  Just speaking logically and not emotionally  I would be interested to see what would happen if conservatives left Twitter in large numbers. Twitter makes money from advertisements  so the only way that would cause the company to take a hit is if other companies who targeted conservative users stopped selling ads on Twitter. I almost never see those types of ads on Twitter.  Precisely my point. Fewer daily active users results in lower ad prices results in lower stock price. Simple as that.  Well  no... it results in less ad revenue.  Prices could easily remain the same.  Yes  that might lower the stock prices.  Ads can be targeted. I have my suspicions that there are orders of magnitude less conservative ads on those platforms than other types of ads  but even if they exist  the algorithm may determine a better one for you. Hard to say.  Considering Facebook has been losing people in droves for years now  I don t think it will work  and besides  conservatives needed the electoral college votes to get Donald Trump elected in 2016. Had it been only popular votes  he would have lost in 2016. Conservatives don t have the numbers to vastly change how a social media company decides who and when someone is banned.  Let them eat gay cake   No it s the opposite   none of them should be censored.  It  39 s a service  not a product   and a free one  no less.  When the terms are updated  you  39 re free to leave. If you want to control that  you need to buy Twitter or vote to regulate it.  I think we passed the era of being able to tell your supoorters to be violent against certain other people with the death of Hitler.   I think you re technically correct but from an ethics and practices point of view  I think it s a slippery slope. I m not sure how much you know about the actual intellectual implications of publisher vs platform but it does matter in terms of legal liability and also just in terms of business ethics.  You are complaining about the fact that all censorship should be prevented on a subreddit that regularly only allows flaired users to comment on major events  and deletes any unflaired users comments  or even comments that are reasonable but not conservative.  The one that get me is conservative members opions which criticise trump being banned  I actually minored in Journalism in college  but I  39 ll admit its been a while. But Twitter is recognized as a social platform legally  and not as a publishing company so I don  39 t see how they would have to abide by the same rules you  39 d see in publishing.   So  you bought into the idea the media made up that Trump incited violence     The guy held a rally spouting baseless claims of a stolen election conspiracy  and told them that   quot WE quot   are going to march to the capitol and  quot take back our country quot .  It  39 s a perfect example of  quot Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest  quot     Saying you should march on the capital isn  39 t inciting violence in my opinion  Neither is  quot taking back your country quot . These are common political phrases.   quot Hey I only told Pauly to  quot take care of him quot  I never said to kill him quot  seriously this is the logic you present.   quot We have someone in there who should not be in there and our country will be destroyed and we  39 re not going to stand for that. quot   What about Rudy s  trial by combat  remark at the rally    Iraq calls on the U.S. regime to respect the principles of democracy  or it will intervene militarily to bring down the dictator   said Mustafa Habib  a well known Iraqi analyst and researcher  in a tweet that mocked Washington s actions abroad.  Twitter is a fucking cesspool.  Absolutely terrifying  and the justification of removal of free speech from adversaries on the left side of aisle is just sad. Saying Trump called for violence by telling people to go home and be peaceful is about as hilarious as it comes. Meanwhile the BLM riots were praised for months and cities allowed sections to be annexed to CHAZ and CHOP where people died without consequence. Hard to feel like this isn  39 t outright war.  Just in their own backyard  they  39 ve allowed  The obvious difference is that Iran didn t attack congress while they were trying to certify national election results. I don t mean that to sound as snarky as it does  but there is a difference here.  This. You ignore why he was banned. Then equate it to others  surprising that you pick tyrants and authoritarians  who have boasted and lied  but not led to the invasion of our capital to illegally change a vote you don  39 t like  and can  39 t prove is illegitimate.  The left is petitioning to label proud boys as a terrorist group but won  39 t acknowledge the haneous shit and actual terrorism antifa is responsible for  This is so wrong.  This is another reason why I ve deleted all social media except Reddit and parler.  Your life does change for the better.  I have already deleted FB but the problem is  this is what the left wants. Since conservatives are constantly assaulted  the pretty normal thing to do is to just stop being politically active and voicing your opinions and stop talking about your beliefs. Then the conservative movement dies further and one day if anyone so much as says something conservative  it  39 s treated as a hate crime. Basically half the country are 2nd class citizens  I just deleted Facebook. I do feel better.  Nobody has ever deleted FB and later regretted it  What about a private businesses right to refuse service to anyone  I thought we all loved that  especially when it came to denying a gay couple a wedding cake. Why the sudden change   Get ready folks  it  39 s just going to get worse.  The republicans don  39 t have control of anything and I am starting to believe they are lining their pockets with corrupt money like everyone else in DC  because most are not doing shit for the people that voted for them.  Starting to believe  R vs D at the federal level has been a convenient illusion for a long time now  Yes sir  welcome to the Divided State of America.  DSA  hmmmm. Who else uses that acronym now   I don  39 t think political party has much to do with whether the politicians are lining their pockets  because most of them are.  In regard to the question posed by the headline  we need to understand the motive  and we still have not done so. Absurdity is not the point. This is not merely an oversight. The culture is governed more and more by the left  and is becoming more and more radical each year. Corporate America is now dependent upon China for survival. The sooner we acknowledge that  the sooner we can come together and address the problem.  Twitter was very clear the reason for ban is the messaging Trump is sending to his radical base to stoke further violence  particularly at the inauguration.

Not the world through social media  I would add speak your mind in a dehumanizing way.  You still can. Just not on private websites who have make their own rules  Private websites who are supposed to be platforms  not publishers.  The same people saying it  39 s bullshit were the same saying you can refuse gay people if you want because you  39 re a private business. Refusal for thee but not for me  and people I like .  I  39 m not saying it  39 s right. I  39 m just saying that these sites have make their own rules and have nothing to do with free speech  I m genuinely curious what is in your mind that you can t speak out about now vs 20 years ago.  How can you not speak your mind in a way that you could in the past   What do you mean   Oh right.  So what are you doing right now   Speaking someone else  39 s mind   And you still got knocked out if you spoke your piece to the wrong people. So I dont know what your point is   Exactly  What  39 s an upvote button you dumbass  If you re on one side of the isle and speak your mind  you get congratulated  if you re on the other and speak your mind  you get lynched. Guess which side gets lynched.  A big difference between 20 years ago and now is that there were no nationally violent events that got in the way of a democratic process. There s a difference between speaking your mind and doing so with the intention of destabilizing the foundations of our democracy.  No  but 30 years ago  a president was nearly killed by a deranged man with a gun  So  like BLM or Antifa when they burned down buildings  destroyed private businesses  murdered innocent people and took over police precincts and set up their own temporary   39 country  39 . Yeah  I agree.  The far between violent actions of BLM  I won t admit to knowing a lot about Antifa  should also be condemned. And social media has done a great job of reeling in content that directly instigated any such violence in the same manner that Trump directly instigated the Capitol s events.  You still can. Social media companies just don  39 t want it happening on their site. You can still speak your mind the same way you would 20 years ago   by phone or in person.  Not in person. When you speak your mind at work  you  39 re quite likely to lose your job.  Could you give an example   You can speak your mind  but twitter is a private company. Why do people keep forgetting this.  It  39 s a platform  like the phone. At least that  39 s what they say. But  if you have an opinion they don  39 t like  you get cancelled.  I mean if they are private they can do what they want  twitter isnt a nyc public park.  NYC public parks are where Conservatives will need to meet soon.  How  39 s that worse than 20 years ago  before Twitter even existed   Not if you were gay. Or black.  exactly. The   39 good old days  39  view of the past is CLEARLY from a straight white male perspective. If you lived outside that norm things are OBJECTIVELY not better in the past.  It  39 s not just social media  this has been ongoing for the last couple decades in the West. If you looked at immigration polls in the 70s or views on gay marriage even among leftists in the 90s in the UK  you  39 d think it was a completely different country to the one it is currently.  Yep  watched All The Right Moves last night no politics just a movie  about football and middle class working Americans.  This. The constant barrage of  information  has led a generation of children to believe nearly everything they see. No questions asked  because optics are more important than the truth. And since it is so easily controlled by a small group of people  there is no dissenting opinions.  Uh  only if you were white back then. The 80 s and 90 s were a horrible time if you weren t white  More like problems are more visible now and people don  39 t like to see truly fucked up our world is. Ignorance is bliss I guess  but I can see how it seems like   39 the good old days  39  if you  39 re a white straight male.  Speaking of double standards  how bout this sub  39 s   39 flaired user only  39  rules  Seems pretty hypocritical to be angry about not letting certain people post on a public platform  while also not letting other certain people post on your public platform. I  39 m sure you have reasons for it  but the fact that these same reasons apply in both cases just adds to the hypocrisy.  You make a decent point but flair is a temporary measure to tackle brigading. When the election hysteria settled it would open back up to everyone  is my understanding anyway .  That also means that this temporary measure is taken at a time when activity on political subs is the highest and the   39 flair only  39  rule is dropped when non conservatives are less likely to engage in  civil  conservative topics.  Shh  you  39 re blowing holes through the narrative. Lefties bad  righties good.  Or how about Iranian leaders calling for the genocide of Jews  Twitter says that is ok because. Is just  political commentary  and  saber rattling .  Cake business   quot I don  39 t want to serve gay couples or publish gay marriage frosting sentiments on my cake because it violates our values.  quot   The thing is most of the people who were banned were mainstream conservatives in new media and conservative journalists.  Exactly. It sounds like there  39 s going to be two parallel internet worlds and I fear it is going to polarize everyone even more if we can  39 t even exist in each other  39 s universe.  Maybe creating new space is not totally bad. More options. More competition.    I brought this up last night on  a href   r news  r news  a  and the leftist  clowns were defending the CCP saying what Trump has done is far worse than anything the CCP has done.  TIL Trump has done worse than putting religious minority citizens in prison camps and using them for slave labor.  Don  39 t forget the forced abortions and harvesting of organs   We should assign China to head the human rights commission for the UN   I really hate the guy but that is just straight up dumb.  Dude you  39 re such a victim wannabe. Plenty of people upvoted your comment.   Ok I  39 ve got to do this to illustrate a point here  probably at the cost of a heap of internet points but oh well.  They banned him for  inciting violence  becuase weeks ago he supported people s right to peacefully protest. Meanwhile  BLM leaders and prominent Dems directly told people to riot and get violent in the summer riots of 2020 and apparently that s acceptable speech     Well it  39 s like what de Blasio said   quot you can only protest for BLM quot . Keep in mind this was when people were protesting the lockdown.  Democrats literally paid bail for violent rioters.  And Kyle Rittenhouse  a mass shooter  raised nearly a million dollars in donations for his legal defense fund.  Right  give me a source on that. What prominent Democrat told them to riot  What BLM leader did so  You want free speech  leave  a href   r Conservative  r Conservative  a . Anytime a reasonable argument is given against any of their mostly absurd comments  you will be banned. Peaceful protests with some rioting and looting  against 400 years of systemic and institutional racism  does not equal a terrorist attack on the US Capitol which was immediately preceded by the president  39 s speech which was full of lies and designed to incite his followers  just as his Twitter account has been full of lies. Twitter had every right to ban him. He has been breaking their rules for years.    quot There needs to be unrest in the streets quot    some African American Congress woman  So was it okay for them to say that  Or was it bad   Lol did you see his response to blm protests    Where have you been   Those guys in dc got treated like spoiled children in comparison.  You are fooling yourself.  Which  prominent Dems directly told people to  strong riot  strong  and  strong get violent  strong      Since when were protests supposed to be peaceful     CNN s Chris Cuomo  in response to conservatives complaining about wonton left wing violence.  Cuomo is a tv opinion host  like Tucker Carlson  who says and does stupid shit all the time.   I  39 m not trying to be antagonistic  I  39 m just genuinely curious. I don  39 t agree with all the destruction of the protests last year but I agree with the message. I  39 m curious as to why most conservatives were not there marching with them  To me  the ability of the state to oppress and kill its citizens with impunity seems like it would be a conservative rallying point. It  39 s very confusing to me.  That  39 s because Twitter and CCP are friends.   Why does one terror inciter have a Twitter and the other doesn t    Jesus Christ Reddit  Funny coming from a sub that specializes in  flaired users only  posts  Then open up all posts on this sub. I can  39 t comment on most of them because I  39 m not a Conservative. Seems kinda hypocritical to whine about Twitter but do the same thing here.  Tyranny by corporations is worse than tyranny by government. No accountability  big tech could ruin you  from credit cards to job searches. We are hanging on the end of a cliff. Hindsight Georgia was the flight 93 election. The Biden presidency hasn t even started yet and already these zealots and tyrants feel comfortable. If we ever gain power again we need to pass 230 reform  individual states need to pass 230 reform and take it to the supreme court  We need individual states to do a lot more than 230 reform. We need to have the states step up and call for amendments to halt federal government overreach at this point. Term limits is one that comes to mind.  Yes  and limiting bills to two pages  Or  rather than limiting it by page  limit it by subject. A general budget bill should be the only type that addresses multiple things that I can think of. Other bills should address only one item so there s no threat of pork.   Either way you d gain an understanding of what your Congress person voted for  That doesn t seem like a conservative opinion to me. I thought the only real tyranny could be at the hand of the government and a corporation is subject to the market. Just trying to understand. Most posts around here are flaired only.  All things said and done Twitter is a business and can refuse service to anyone including trump. They  39 re not censoring him. They just won  39 t allow him to use their platform. If he wants to say anything to his base he can hold a rally or get on a megaphone. No one is stopping him.  Because they re cowards who fear opposing views  Ironic to say on a forum that pulls and blocks users with opposing views.  Where  quot opposing views quot     quot literally trying to overthrow the government quot .  Nice of you to say this in one of the 3  a href   r conservative   r conservative  a  threads that are not   39 flaired users only  39   This goes far beyond opposing views. The sitting president was involved in the attack on our nations capitol  and has been repeating false claims for months to rial people up with no evidence that has made it through any court system. Either his lawyers are terrible at their job  or they simply don t have enough evidence.  I mean you have to admit that  39 s ironic on a forum that verifies that people agree with your views before they  39 re allowed to comment on almost anything.  This  They aren  39 t censoring Trump. They banned him from the platform for violation of their terms of use. They both should he banned. Twitter isn  39 t the battlefield for free speech. It  39 s a platform that these people have willingly agreed to adhere to the terms of use and are subject to be removed from the platform should they violate the terms.   No one should be censored. On a sub that has a   39 flaired users only  39  policy.  The party of deregulation just experienced the consequences of deregulation. They  39 re free to do business how they like  America baby   This is a very true.  I  39 ll say upfront  I  39 m on the left. I do come here to read up on both sides.  Yall know that reddit is a company that can decide what is allowed on their platform right   1    It s not just the tech firms whose double standards are absurd  it is us.   I am against the endless wars  and I usually think war is wrong   propagated by some elite rich old men for business ideology reasons and letting the young men die for it. But today  39 s climate and censorship illustrates how wars are often inevitable. These people push and push until you  39 re entire way of life  your beliefs  your freedom and your livelihood are gone. These liberal fascists have nobody to blame when another civil war inevitably erupts   whether it  39 s the near future or further away  It s literally the republicans who made this  censorship  possible. All of you conservatives were crying about how you didn t want to have to give CAKE to gay people and how businesses should be able to choose who they serve. You all got what you wanted.  I think the reasoning for this  and it makes sense to me  is that indirect calls to violence from leaders of other countries aren  39 t likely to have much of an effect on the US  when did you last see a large pro Iran protest    whereas the president  39 s are. It  39 s a question of practice rather than principle  the president really did incite real violence that actually happened and could do so again.  But isn  39 t twitter a private company that can do whatever they want  Free market baby  At least you dum dums didn  39 t make this a  strong flaired users only  strong  post  Stop expecting leftism to make sense.       Hilarious for a sub that  um   em moderates  em  the conversation via  em Flaired Users Only  em  tags to complain about removing  del dissenting  del  violent voices.  Seriously.  If deplatforming someone from a private forum is a violation of their rights  then this very subreddit is violating all of our rights in 90  of their threads.  Don  39 t worry  they  39 ll be flairing this sub soon enough so they can cry about censorship and the first amendment without any disagreement.  Blame the bigots that didn  39 t bake the cake  Just think of Trump as a gay wedding cake and Twitter as a Christian bakery  then it makes sense.  It  39 s to show us who is really in charge. Twitter backs the CCP.  So it s either let Trump say whatever he wants  make falsie claims all day long and offer no proof at all or be supportive of CCP   Twitter is a private company with rules  Trump broke those rules numerous times and Twitter is fully within their rights to punish him as they say fit. The First Amendment protects from the government silencing critics  not businesses following their own rules.  Private. Company.  Where  39 s my good comrade Bernie saying we need to break up big tech now   Did he stop saying it   So you agree now   He  39 s saying it in between comments about impeaching trump.   Businesses should be able to refuse business to anyone  on their own terms      but not like that    em shocked pikachu face  em   I don  39 t like all this bitching about   39 the other side  39   or the left leaning liberal media social media  I thought Conservatives were supposed to be the main driving force behind the economy and industry  It all just comes off as jealousy and bitching about what   39 the other side have created  39    I have said it before  if you don  39 t like Twitter  or their policies   or Facebook  or YouTube  or whatever  build your own fucking alternatives  instead of just whining and complaining about how the other side holds all the cards and because you don  39 t like the way they choose to run their companies  If conservatism is the natural ally of business and industry  where are all the fucking conservative leaning social media companies that can rival FB  Twitter et al  Surely that  39 s the only real answer   So we should let gay couples get wedding cakes from any bakery.  Because Twitter is based off in the U.S. They dont give a shit about riots in China or Iran. Isnt it all about America first   This is easy. They are a for profit company and believe taking a stand  whether right or wrongly  against trump will result in long term profits. Taking a stand against ccp would mean twitter would never be able to operate in China and thus shut off from all those potential users.   Why ban pwople from here then   Freedom of Speech does not apply to private companies just like how any store can refuse to do business with you  so can twitter. If he wants to be heard he has a tv room ready to go 24 7.  Everybody here wines about censorship  yet most of the posts in this subreddit require you to be Flaired users which is tightly regulated by a small group of moderators who only allow  true  conservatives in... that seems like an absurd doublestandard to me  They re a private company  Why would they not have the right to do this   Twitter isn  39 t censoring Trump. Only the government can do that. Twitter is a private company that can host anyone or kick anyone off their network as they see fit. Remember   Well Trump is a traitor to our democracy so maybe that s why  His hair is fake too....  So you admit that DT is as bad as the CCP     I feel like this is trying to take away from the fact that Trump encouraged his followers to storm the capitol in an attempt of a  coup d  39 etat.  Trump isn  39 t being censored. He  39 s got a press office at the white house. He can go stand behind the podium and deliver his message directly to the people. Maybe take some questions from reporters.   Social media is the worst thing to have ever happened to humans. It has turned most people into self righteous and self centered a holes.  Twitter is just dirty. It s pathetic  Because the CCP didn  39 t incite a seditious riot at the Capitol during what is supposed to be a constitutionally peaceful transition of power after spreading lies  rumors and conspiracy theories without a shred of proof inflame millions with the false idea that the country was stolen.   I wonder if it s possible to get banned from these platforms for inciting violence against The Guvmint  other common left wing hate...aka..political comments from the Left wing perspective  to be clear Leftists making  threats to overthrow constitution and threats of physical violence against Pols    would be a  fun  experiment  You think Twitter gives a shit about the political leanings of the people who violate their TOS   Trump was banned for breaking the rules.  Lol its even funnier that conservative think forcing twitter to host content they dont agree with is a viable solution. Twitter is a private company  they arent legally required to host your speech  just like any physical business can control what happens on their property  twitter has every right to choose who they do business with  even if youd dont like it. How can the Republican party support allowing store owners to refuse service with people they dont agree with  gay people  but simultaneously want to force companies like Twitter to do business with people they dont agree with. Its hypocrisy. Businesses have rights just like you and I  they can do business to however they like  as long as they arent breaking the law  and refuse service to whoever they like  as long as they arent a protected class   If you dont like it  dont use their service  plain and simple  Lessons from history  Forced silence inexorably leads to violence.  So when a bakery doesnt want to bake a cake for a gay couple its fine  but when trump violates TOS of a private industry its somehow a violation of the 1st amendment  The 1st amendment exists to protect us from the government  not citizens private businesses.  Twitter isn t a public good it is private property  therefore Twitter can decide who can be on their platform and who can be taken off their platform. Just like reddit can decide who can make a site  and moderators can decide who can post. It isn t censorship because it doesn t involve the government like in China.  You don t like hearing about all the benefits of concentration camps    deleted   Twitter is not the government.  It is a private company and has the right to censor whomever they want.  That  39 s the free market.  That  39 s capitalism.  Well  did a member of the CCP use Twitter to form a mob and then use that mob to invade the capitol building   Interestingly enough  the CCP  a href  https   twitter.com ChineseEmbinUS status 1347247602094534658  rel  nofollow  tweet  a  referenced in the story now shows a notice that the tweet goes against their policy... yet the tweet and the account still exist. The  warning  is all for show.  Whats your point  Its a private company  dont like them  dont use their service  plain and simple
t3_kttq33,Mexican President AMLO Condemns Twitter Facebook for Censoring Donald Trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/kttq33/mexican_president_amlo_condemns_twitter_facebook/,They make their money by having users. Deactivate your account today.  can  39 t. it was already banned. just like my last 13 accounts hahaha  How do you get banned  Whenever I comment something outrageous some random ass moron starts cursing me out and nothing happens.  I referred to Jack as a  cunt  and was banned instantaneously  You weren t lying tho...  i don  39 t know to be honest. they never told me.  1  Find photos of aborted fetus  As the looney toon punches the clown while looking at dismembered baby parts  This made me giggle  What are you even doing to get banned 10  times  expressing myself freely  I can already imagine.  I was banned thrice on transphobic grounds. Lol  To be fair actual transphobia is pretty terrible but I m curious as to what  Are you actually transphobic or was it just a heat of the moment angry comments you made   Not exactly phobic. But I don  39 t believe in it. Few scientific opinions are being misinterpreted as facts to show that is totally normal.  I get it  I  39 m in the same boat. I believe there  39 s only 2 genders  and I believe wanting to be a gender you  39 re not is a form of mental illness thats why its called  quot Gender dysphoria quot    Exactly  They could save us of so much confusion by learning to accept their body instead of creating a new identity.  100 . Unfortunately the left lumps everyone who doesn t agree with them the same.  They see your thoughts on trans people exactly the same as someone who says they should be dead.  EXACTLY THE SAME.  Because they re fucking insane.  How do you even evade a ban every account I make just gets banned again lol  Way ahead of ya. My partner and I deactivated our accounts with Facebook and Twitter. My liberal sisters are doing the same  they don  39 t like censorship on any level. My father doesn  39 t know how to use social media and is resolved to keep it that way  heh  .  Only deactivated  If you are serious then you will DELETE your account and wait a month without logging in to allow it to purge.   How do you delete them  I only saw options to deactivate the accounts.  Insta   a href  https   www.instagram.com accounts remove request permanent   https   www.instagram.com accounts remove request permanent   a   Never hand either. Waste of my very limited personal time and time from my very lucrative business selling Bed Bug powder to Antifa  BLM Protesters.  Market forces are no more our friends than weather patterns  but they are just as predictable.  Done.  What account   They sell us. We actually buy from them when we use their apps.  Isn  39 t it funny that the evil racist anti mexican president Trump became good friends with Mexican El Presidente           And Europe. It  39 s like they have dictators in living memory in Latin America.  It s pretty clear that not critiquing trump constantly makes you literally Adolf Hitler. You have to be super super smart to see the connection and totally not be an unhinged looney though  No fault on their end too. Most of them are headline readers and have no depth of knowledge. It s scary.  That and just the inability to consider and compare different perspectives on an event  The best quote for the day.  Crazy people  by definition  don t know they re crazy. I m not surprised that some blue haired motherfucker called you a Nazi for speaking truth.   The darkness hates the light.  You know it s bad when even the Mexican president is starting to see  and call out  all the bullshit going on with the left.  Let them eat gay cake   Lol  some people on the left really aren t mature enough to have a level headed debate.  Dude do yourself a favor and turn off dms and chats. I did have improved my user experience so much.  I ve NEVER gotten DM s for shit until I started posting here. I bet I have 20  from a few comments.  Imagine calling someone a nazi for saying Donald Trump is friends with the Mexican president  and that third world countries care more about free speech than the dems. How can one survive with so few brain cells   And shits just gonna get worse.  which parts of the world   It  39 s not as  quot funny quot  when you consider that presidents like Mexico  39 s AMLO are currently among the worst. It  39 s the same guy that went on national TV and publicly said covid was being handled with  quot hugs and prayers quot   and the same person that was caught in a family reunion of an important narco drug cartel member. And almost weekly he makes himself a national embarrassment on  a href   r Mexico  r Mexico  a    How is it that Mexico is now the bastion of free speech and democracy AND coke with real cane sugar     Also the other kind of coke.  And voter ID.  Mt. Dew throwback with real cane sugar is fing amazing.  How long do you think it  39 s going to take before white liberals start accusing Latinos  of Mexican descent and Mexicans in general  of being white and exercising white privilege   Already did it to the Cubans  It already happened when Florida went for Trump.  Suppressing expression will lead to extremism  amassing that republicans are not screaming at the stupidity of suppressing conservative points of view and so easily accept the labels of rioting and extremism while at the same time remained silent when antifa was burning and looting. Again suppressing of expression is the last thing a free country  or any  needs. The next step persecuting the opposition and silencing the little remaining free press. Write this down as it is happening. People have the government they deserve. And remember that ISIS was recruiting though Facebook  the Iran leader has called for the destruction of Isrrael and death to American without as mucha as being censored. Stop supporting the platforms of domination  close your accounts  let the feel that that.  Thank god there s a political figure outside the states that think it was wrong  We must look like a total joke to other countries.  We were once the dominant country and now we are a joke thanks to the Left.  China is obviously happy because they basically own us now.  It s bad enough they released the virus to begin with but now they become the dominant super power.  I feel like I m watching that movie Red Dawn 1984  except With no hopeful resolution in sight  At least we dont need to fear a future war with China. China will just continue to buy out every level of the US. In 20 30 years the US will be a second tier power. A servile state indebted to  owned by and politically aligned with China  with mass censorship and suppression of any and all dissenting voices.  I hope it never get to that point and the Republican  fights back But right now it looks bleak  I  39 ve been practicing shouting  quot Wolverines  quot    Yup.  I ever wanted it to come to this but we may have to start thinking about fighting back.  It s pretty clear they are trying to destroy conservatives and the Republican Party once and for all.  The media obviously wants a civil war but I honestly I think we would crush them because 95 percent of them are cowards   removed    removed   Gorilla with a U.  Remember the Harambamo   Rather have a condom and not need it  then need one and not have it.   There  39 s definitely a resolution in place for things like this. We  39 re just not there yet. Key word  yet.  Tbh these days everyone in Europe hates you Americans. Not the people per se  but the state and politics and cultural hegemony. Once American was cool  and these days if we refer to something being American it usually means it is something dumb.  That s funny. We don t think about you at all.  Nah  you  39 re a joke because Trump and his cult supporters.  Nah you re a joke.  Go back to  a href   r politics  r politics  a  where bullshit is a requirement  Politics  I  39 m not even subscribed to that sub lol  Yeah ok    Why are you so salty  Lol   em  quot If you don  39 t like Twitter  39 s rules  then go make you own platform  quot   em   Mexican here.  Hopefully he stands up to big tech and starts fining them for censorship in Mexico. US seems to be all talk but no action. Canada just seems to embrace censorship.  The Mexican President definitely truly has balls. More real than Israel  39 s Prime Minister that  39 s for damn sure.   removed   Lmao  what  The guy has everything but balls. It doesn  39 t take more than a quick peek at  a href   r Mexico  r Mexico  a  or local news to see how much of the educated part of the country hates this senile old man. If anything  you can bet that AMLO will bend over to whatever policy the next government introduces. He  39 s a jackass that is no better than previous presidents  if anything  maybe worse since he has made public how closely tied he is to local narco cartels by attending family meetings. Let alone his mishandling of Covid by making a national announcement that covid will be treated with  quot hugs and prayers quot . The only reason he won is because of his fake populism  of which he has struggled to keep almost all of his promises  Your fake news is not welcomed here.  To bad my trudeau doesnt have any balls   removed    removed   Thats not likely to happen.  But wasn  39 t he a radical communist  I  39 m confused.  It s a different president than the one when Trump entered office.  I know who he is. You know he is a left wing politician  right   AMLO is fucking bonkers. Years ago  he kinda did something similar to Trump  but worse. He declared himself president years ago in a previous election  even though he lost. He then paraded himself and his followers to their equivalent of America  39 s White House and rallied outside  as if he  39 d won  he didn  39 t . The people didn  39 t riot a government building  though. Still quite a fascinating comparison.  He also said Spain should ask forgiveness for the conquest of 500 years ago. The mofo maybe thinks his surname comes from some Aztec or Toltec ancestors lol  Seriously ballsy for him to stand up for Trump against what is arguably the most powerful enemy to ever exist.  This enemy has existed since the dawn of time.  I hope mexico is prepared for the border situation to be thrown into full reverse after biden financially ruins the country.  Sorry  not familiar with the border situation. Are you suggesting that it  39 s currently good  and Biden will make it worse...   I  39 m suggesting instead of people going from mexico to the US in droves it will be the other way around.  Wasn  39 t this already starting to happen due to strict lockdowns   I thought I remember hearing that.  Banning people means you re scared of what they re saying because it s calling you out. Even if someone is an idiot and writes something stupid  people can reply and explain to them how they are wrong and why they shouldn t say that. But duct tape over their mouth isn t democratic nor promoting free speech and exchange of ideas. It also keeps people from hearing other points of view and their own radical beliefs get further and further reinforced. We need to promote more discussion  not take out what we don t like. Even if you don t like what the person says  it doesn t matter. They still are alive on this earth and deserve to talk  Absolutely correct. Not only that  but they are actually promoting Trump and his ideas by banning him. Just look at the increase in sales of albums that got slapped with parental advisory stickers or movies that were banned or censored in other countries. When you say  quot Don  39 t look at this quot  it makes people want to see it even more...  The forbidden fruit is always sweeter   I believe that  39 s what  39 s called   39 The Streisand Effect  39 .  Agreed. I think the flaired users only thing is stupid 100   I would agree with this if the stupid population of the world were capable of having real discussion and understanding nuance  they aren  39 t and don  39 t .  Getting more support from Mexico then our own leadership... ohh the irony  Mexico President is based   You know he is kinda ta bitch when it come to the narco problem right   He s right. Mexico might be finishing the Trump wall to keep American communist refugees out after the Biden presidency.  My hope is that one of the ways this backfires is that half the country will get off social media and therefore out of their control.  He may be a leftist but he  39 s far more intellectually honest than most DC republicans  How is AMLO a leftist    a href  https   www.voanews.com americas obrador mexicos first leftist president decades  https   www.voanews.com americas obrador mexicos first leftist president decades  a   He s a populist.  How many years until democrats destabilize Mexico again   The century  39 s old two party system that AMLO broke is now united against him. They are running under the same party  like if the establishment democrats and the establishments republicans suddenly merge. Let  39 s see if AMLO can resist.

My gosh  Isn t this the dude that wants to hug drug cartels instead of treating them like drug cartels or was that the last president   Trump helped Mexico a ton.  No he didn t  Hmmm    AMLO is about to be the least corrupt leader in North America  Does he even have the internet   So  he is more American than our big tech overlords...  What happens to conservatism when trump abandons politics    He knows he s next if he dissents....  I like him  They are deplatforming Trump to lessen the impact his final announcements will have. Trump probably plans on releasing top secret information about aliens  the JFK assassination  etc.. He gave the intelligence agencies 180 days to make those announcements and now that Biden is in he probably doesn t trust the next administration to follow up with those demands so he will leak info himself.   deleted   As he should. What they have done is alienated half of the country  along with those worldwide that share similar beliefs. As a result  these big tech companies will  a href  https   www.foxbusiness.com markets twitter shares down nearly 4 in after hours trading following trump ban  lose stock  a   lose credibility  and suffer financial blunders.  Where  if anywhere  can Trump actually stay connected to his fanbase  Where can I see his message  Are there any platforms left execpt regular media and fox news     Havent heard from him in days..  The left doesn  39 t seem to understand that shutting down these users and sights is not about whether or not they agree with the opinion. It is about the protection of free speech which  in today  39 s society  includes social media platforms. Social media has become ingrained in the very fabric of most people  39 s lives. To simply say   quot Well  they are private companies and can do what they want quot  is a very interesting thing for the left to say. Just a couple of years ago  they forced a bakery to bake a cake for a gay couple  or risk fines  although they are a private company. They hypocrisy of the left is infuriating. The fact that their supporters either don  39 t notice it  due to stupidity  or act like it doesn  39 t occur  due to ignorance arrogance  is slightly more infuriating.  I just used Twitter to see trumps tweets but now I cant also who cares for the opinion of a pres of a third world yes Mexico is a third world country  I m glad I m seeing more and more people speaking out about how utterly insane this is. Although it s sad that it s coming from other countries and not the people it s directly affecting most  The Mexican government has now expressed more concern over the tech oligarchy than the entire Democratic party. Truly we live in the Clown World.  They  dems  said Trump is racist about Mexicans  he  39 s fascist etc... But censoring is somehow good thing for them.   Hey thanks to the decision of a republican supreme court in a case about gay wedding cakes the big tech giants can do this so... Trump fucked himself here lol  Ive never been so happy as when I deleted my Facebook and Twitter accounts. It s gold  This is the left flexing.   quot This is your boy  look what I can do to your boy. quot   Though AMLO was a socialist as well. Shocking to see a positive example of someone on the left speaking for what seems like free speech rights. Not expected  but I ll take it.

He s totally wrong. The FCC is fully functional and the clubs that do the test are running as well.  Can t get more MAGA than ham radio  That would be fun. Just pretend we re in the Cold War communicating secretly.  The  5G causes COVID  faction of the GOP are all of a sudden experts in wireless communication   That s fucking rich.  I got my license. Get yours people    Chain letters  Just going to buy one of those Ravens from GOT  Then you have to be reminded of how awful GoT was every time you see it though.

There are individual episodes worth watching  but yeah  tried to get into it again with HBOMax and it s fucking lame. The overall story really isn t that interesting.  for me  it was always about the production value they were putting into a TV series  especially after first 2 seasons . My friends didn  39 t like hearing me criticize the story.  Stupid Dan and Dave   DaNy JuSt KiNd Of FoRgOt    deleted   Discord is not as safe as you think. Parler is fine  though apple google are pursuing locking them out of their app store to greatly reduce the number of people able to access their communities.  Discord deleted all of the largest pro trump groups yesterday. You aren  39 t escaping there  Wouldn  39 t the best way to remain undetected   create a discord with a name etc completely unrelated to Conservatism   But discuss said topic  Or is there some algorithm yadda yadda   The real challenge is these are all private companies and they can make whatever rules they want.   Something to think on  is that the problem isn t conservatism  it is the jackasses calling for violence in the name of conservatism. Liberals don t really care if it is a debate of ideas  but too many fools feel the need to call for violence if they don t get their way. That is why they are getting shut down.  The hang pence crap on Twitter is an example here  I can see that   and understand that . However the voices of the few shouldn  39 t dictate the punishment of the many.  I don t disagree  but in the case of any of this  you are dealing with private companies. They have as much right to refuse service to any of us as a baker has to not make a wedding cake for someone whose lifestyle he disagrees with.  All that said  I have this argument with my more liberal friends who are cheering the deplatforming of these sites  basically my position is that they are cheering something that might happen to them i the future.  The vocal minority unfortunately is louder than the quiet indifferent majority.  Amazon announced they are not going to host Parler as of tomorrow.  Amazon AWS halting Parker....they re done  Ah  does discord have Chinese interests or some shit   Tencent  a CCP company has an interest in Discord.  No they are far left activist similar to the reddit admins. They have and do ban conservatives. The service was built so support gamers  so not incredibly surprising. I use it  but admins will insert themselves into channels and ban people.  If you ain  39 t left and trying to silence conservatives yer a booklicking fascist white supremecist nazi.  The moment I started questioning BLM  39 s motives over the summer  a handful of my friends seemed to become a bit wary of me. And in discussing the events over the summer with strangers online  I was immediately a super bigot fascist for presenting another side.   And that  39 s how I got pushed here as well. I thought of my self as a liberal for the longest time until I realized Meritocracy  family and freedom of speech are far right positions.  Fuckin a  friendo. This summer was my turning point. I wasn  39 t ever a hardcore Democrat  but I did consider myself liberal. Turns out I just hadn  39 t put in the self reflection and history research. I still don  39 t consider myself far right tho  even tho the ideals you mention are all very important to me.  I always held these values but I thought these were moderate values.   Welcome to the realities of the left. Hive mind of children.  Dark days ahead.   it really says that the average American European hasn  39 t a clue about political history.  When I was like 10 or whatever  I HATED history class.  Every dayi would ask my mom  quot whyyyy do I even need to know this   It  39 s in the past  it all happened already.  They  39 re dead and there  39 s nothing I can do to change it. quot   She told me that those who don  39 t know their history are doomed to repeat it.  10 year old me rolled my eyes at the platitude.  20 something year old me cringes so hard at how right mom is turning out to be.  They either don  39 t know the history or condemn everything about the past pretending you can build utopia themselves which would lead to a new Stalin.  Yeah man  people are herd creatures and will eat you if you step outside acceptable norms. Questioning the narrative makes you an evil racist and evil racists do not have human rights.  Soon apple will kill parler though    You can still access it through the web. You actually don t need an app.  ..but I  em want  em  an app  Well  I guess you could write one  Didn t you learn to code when Obama told you to   Would still get banned from the App Store if parler itself is banned  Such a shame.  Ehhhhh this post didnt age well did it   I only joined the Donald sub after it got quarantined. Just my personality I guess  the more you tell me I can  39 t do or say something  the more interest I take in it.  I  39 m a moderate conservative. But this sub is so much more reasonable than the rest of the Reddit echo chamber.  That  39 s not a high threshold tbh.   The problem  is that bigger companies and maybe even the government eventually  will be able to silence these new sources of information. All the new apps that are letting people speak aren t going to get any good funding to actually be good apps.  Don  39 t stress. There will always be black markets. There will always be an underground. There will always be people trying to help and come together. The names may change but there will always be one.  You are right  but every hoop you have to jump through to get to those sources will make it so that less and less people will want to get to those sources. And we shouldn t have to go underground to share our speech  it s really disappointing to see what s happening. And to think  democrats always call republicans the nazis  Parler  Protonmail  Signal.    I mean nowere really. Our only choice is a Conservative dot win page just like thedonald or conspiracy.

I mean this is just insane  They will one day  when it happens to them.  Nah  I  39 m left of center  wouldn  39 t call myself a democrat  married to someone who would call themselves a democrat.  Regardless of what you think about trump or conservative ideas  just know that you will not be allowed to think  discuss or see anything that isn  39 t approved by big tech and aligns with their current ideology.   I can agree to that. That s why it s important to rely on sources other than electronics and to do some of your own investigations. Or at least have a neutral standing on things you don t fully understand. Being an iconoclast also helps.  If they can remove the President of the United States  they can and will remove you too.  The removal of Trump is shocking in many ways  but we  39 re also already under pretty heavy algorithmic manipulation. It  39 s not conjecture  it  39 s easily proven fact. And it  39 s changing everything.  I love moderates like you who can see both sides.   Despise Trump but this is going too far. Anyone who thinks this is not a dangerous precedence is delusional. They literally in unison cut off the bloodline in an instant. Forget Trump. The mere fact that they can do this worries the hell out of me.  Yet still post the  quot First they came for the... quot  quote.  As if they haven t been flapping their fat mouths for the last 5 years  resisting literally anything POTUS said. SPARE ME    deleted   Welcome to free market capitalism. They re allowed to do that. The issue isn t with the bans.   Its not really free market capitalism if there is not a readily available competitor. These companies monopolistic behavior is what drives mass dependency to their product  in this case their platform.  I mean  it is though. Monopolies will naturally form in a free market. Nature of the beast.   This is what bewildered me. How the fk do people truly believe they are stopping a Hitler rising. How do we get to them when we got banned off every platform  We can  39 t even stop the hivemind now  To them the ends justifies the means.  These people applaud and cheer any authoritarian force  even if they can see and admit its blatantly corrupt and anti democratic. As long as they step on the neck of their political enemies first they don  39 t care what happens. THey just chase the high of the   39 win  39  over everything.   moderate  democrat here  it s pretty fucking ridiculous that  em all  em  methods of communication from the president are being cut off. I don t like the guy  but this shit isn t healthy for democracy  especially at this time.  Moderate democrat here  I also believe the silencing is alarming  I agree with you and you  39 re right...it isn  39 t. So basically  his rights to speak have been stripped. What are they so afraid of  If the election was won fair and square  then the new administration takes office in a mere 10 days. Cutting off all communication seems so extreme to me. Not just for Trump but locking out anyone with dessenting opinions. While the spotlight is now on the right  it can easily swing left. Scary times we are living in right now.  They  39 re not. He can still hold a press conference  he won  39 t. He has a lot of ways to speak to the American people. A private company is  and should be  allowed to ban anybody from their service.  media outlets don t air his conferences  My husband and I had a whole conversation with my MIL last night about this  and she isn t concerned at all.  There aren t any  Moderate  Democrats left.  When their own liberties are taken away  but it ll be too late by then..  I think most of the  rational left  is worried about where this is going even though most are ok with kicking him off twitter specifically. But they are impotent against the gleeful mob right now. I wish people would listen to Greenwald and his warnings of overreaction.  They are becoming as dogmatic as the Catholic Church was at the height of their powers in the Middle Ages.   At this point it  39 s collusion between all of big tech and using there monopolistic powers to undermine the president of the USA.  He isn  39 t  quot banned from the internet. quot  He can go right to his own webpage and post anything he wants and everyone can go and read it if they want to.  He also can use a variety of tools that other presidents have used like press releases and interviews. Twitter isn  39 t his only avenue. Presidents spoke to the public before it  I really don t understand the outrage here. How is this different than the gay wedding cake case  These are private companies. And it s absurd to pretend like this is muzzling the president  he lives in a house with a press briefing room in it. He is fully capable of speaking to Americans without Twitter  just as every president before him has.  If only there was a way for the President to directly address the people. Like a designated room with cameras to broadcast a message. It could even have members of the press there. It would be like a  press room  or something.  My grandpa told me of a place like that. I forgot what its called  It  39 s so funny that people are acting the president has no other avenues beside Twitter   I think you might be on to something.  I don t like all the deplatforminv  but he s not cut off from his supporters. The man has a goddamn PRESSROOM in his house and can have every media outlet on the planet filming him at a moments notice.  All themlibs over at  a href   r news  r news  a  are laughing not understanding what the implications of a mass ban of an account not just the president.  Twitter changed their rules to allow the president to break them   because he brought in much more money through controversy which drives engagement and ad sales  but they also needed a rationale so they expanded it to all world leaders .  He was never held to the same rules as a common citizen  who would get immediately banned for many of he things he did on there that were against the TOS  doxing people  etc. .  They Ban trump but allow the ayatollah in Iran to call for genocide of all Jews. Same with Farrakhan.   I think a lot of people seem to forget that the first amendment means the GOVERNMENT can  39 t prevent you from stating your opinion.    He has a press room in his fucking house. He can have a press conference and say whatever he wants at any time. Twitter can not stop him from talking.  I  39 m sorry but this is pure hyperbole.   You guys know private businesses reserve the right to deny service in America right   Lmao to bad he doesn  39 t have an official some would say presidential way to address the people of the USA... if only  Trump was warned. For awhile it seemed like he would act. Then nothing. This is the result of inaction.  Usually totalitarian regimes take away the people  39 s guns before they enforce extreme censorship.  They re coming for those next.  Well we  39 re prepared because they decided to put the cart infront of the horse  As a libertarian  I support private businesses rights to deny service. Stop crying about it.  Can I have some examples  actual question   December 10  1918  the Council of People s Commissar mandated that Soviet citizens turn in their firearms. Failure to do so  led to criminal prosecution.  Thanks  You guys act like Trump is the first POTUS to never have access to social media.  He isn  39 t any more cut off from the public than any of his predecessors pre social media  he just doesn  39 t like the accountability that comes from having press briefings.  But by all means  keep thinking that this isn  39 t the exact kind of behavior that conservatives have been clamoring for by businesses.  i was wondering why i haven  39 t been getting 15 emails a day from the Trump campaign anymore lmao  When you re an active domestic terrorist with access to USA nuclear codes then yeah makes sense why Trump has been dunked into the dark ages. Hopefully he s purged forever and the Conservative party can someday recoup and have a better foundation than own the libs. Maybe try  run a country and unite the United States.  I think as long as you guys don  39 t try to organize an Insurrection  promote violence especially around the inauguration youll probably be fine.  Well he has his own private domains and he can always use it.  Until the hosting company pulls the plug.  Nothing stopping them from self hosting. It  39 s not difficult  I  39 m sure a multi billionaire can pay someone to do it  Until CDN  SSL  DNS  etc providers all ban his website too. And even the ISP could. Why stop at email accounts   I mean sure  but there are significantly worse sites out there that are still hosted by ISPs. I don  39 t see that happening.   Freedom of speech is more of an idea than a reality now. Don  39 t like being banned from social media  Make your own  bigot. Try to make your own  Fuck you  now you  39 re banned by banks and payment processors  make your own bigot    deleted   They don  39 t care. Pelosi is publicly circumventing Trump and obstructing his military command. An absolute attempt at a coup  and they applaud her.  You all crying about stuff being taken down because it  39 s  quot conservative views quot  are ridiculous. Have you ever seen the stuff posted on Parler   Oh no  The consequences of his actions. How horrible for him.  Say goodbye 230  Like the Democrat controlled congress is ever going to punish their ministry of propaganda.  Legit question not trying to be snarky or anything. If 230 went away  wouldn  39 t Parler then be open to all sorts of legal action due to the posts about violence on there  I just used Parler as an example since I see posts news about the content.  Yes  people don t seem to realize that making social media liable for what is posted on it will result in significantly more moderation of content.  The rules will be much stricter  not more lax  Wouldn  39 t practically web forums be open to leagal action for what their users post   It would shut down practically all social media  though that may not be a bad thing.  ... that no email provider is subject to.  This has nothing to do with section 230.  This is a company parting ways with a client they think negatively impacts them.    Ah  yes. The man with an entire room dedicated to broadcasting his every word to the world and a team of journalists on standby whose job it is to report on everything he says and does is so  cut off . The imaginary victim complex of conservatives just keeps on keeping on.  Guys I just have to point out that an email server costs a few hundred dollars  nobody can cut off Trump  39 s ability to send emails for more than the half hour it  39 d take an IT guy to set up a server for him.  Obviously the President needs to be able to communicate with the American people. The Twitter ban seems sudden and ultimately spineless  2 weeks left   but Trump also abused that Twitter account if it was an official communication channel. He kind used it more as a medium for whatever random thing cross his head while he was taking a shit.  Particularly CSPAN. If you think CSPAN is fake news  you re probably brain washed and need to step out of the cult.  Guy is still the president of the free world  he could be on tv 24 7 if he so chose. Just because his attention span is only at twitter levels doesn  39 t mean he  39 s been  quot silenced quot .  Did Twitter fire the entire communications staff and broadcast equipment of the White House  Did not know they had that kind of pull.  Even leftists should be scared that the power to completely cancel a still sitting president these tech companies have. Do they really think they are part of the team as their useful idiots   Ahh yes  completely canceled. Except for Parler  fox  newsmax  oan  and the ability to hold press conferences and make televised speeches directly to the public.  Parler is supposed to be removed from AWS tomorrow.  What are you guys taking about  He  39 s still the president. He has a room IN HIS HOUSE designed for televised broadcasts. There are people there 24 7 waiting to put him on TV. He CHOOSES not to use it.  I think a lot of people are mistaking what twitter is doing for stifling free speech  when they  39 re just exercising their right not to spread Trump  39 s dangerous rhetoric and propaganda. They are not obligated to do so. For instance  If I wanted to run a libelous article about a political opponent  I can  39 t force the Post to nationally distribute it. I  39 m welcome to mutter my lies to myself in my home. Hell  I can say so in public and people will decide for themselves if I  39 m crazy or not. The difference with Trump is his influence and wide reach. Not all of us with conservative values are these terrible people that sometimes get swept into generalized statements  but it  39 s clear that some Trump supporters can  39 t be trusted to discern an alternate reality provided to them by Trump from the way things actually are.  This is really some Orwellian crap  They re going to push us to the dark web.  All he has to do is hold a press conference.  At least he still has the postal system.... oh wait.  Here  39 s an honest question. What if it was President Obama who tried this shit plus the calls to Georgia    I would imagine that if Obama had tried this  the world would be just as mad at him too.  It  39 s amazingly disappointing how  people are so  dumb as fuck.  It  39 s embarrassing.  Those w a passport get the point.  Just wait till they learn about mister bones wild ride.  I think people have forgotten the president has more ways than just social media to address the people. Its like people have forgotten what a president acting presidential looks like.  He  39 s been banned because he  39 s a criminal with power. He needs to be ousted and jailed.  As a conservative  I support the right of private companies to choose with whom they do business.  He incited a coup. Aren t you guys the law and order party   Yeah it may have been a good idea to start cracking down on Big Tech when we had the senate  Honestly wondering  what is it you would have wanted them to do   You do know that if they got rid of 230  these tech companies could bece liable for what is posted on their platforms and Trump would have been banned sooner instead of twitter  39 s cute little  quot hey  here  39 s an exclamation point  hopefully whoever sees this has enough common sense to understand Trump is lying about election fraud  but for the time being he can spread it on our platform quot   right   a party with no foresight deserves to lose. if this is what sparks a big focus on some Big Tech antitrust from the republlican party  I  39 m all for it.  Should have been done in 2016 2018 instead of... whatever they did.

Honestly maybe we would all be better off with less social media anyway  Watch the Netflix Documentary  The Social Dilemma.  I ve cut out most social media since then and it s been very refreshing.  The scary part is I  39 ve known this for years and everyone thought I was going insane.  It  39 s odd  in college I brought up the negative effect social media can have on childhood development and mental health and it was met with  resistance... It was viewed more as an avenue for implementing positive social change  more appropriately social upheaval .

I didn  39 t realize how much was tracked until I started to work in development. Seeing how long people stay on a screen  which pages they navigate to and from where  which device and platform they  39 re using  etc all tired to a single user. Just a crazy amount of data that is tracked and that  39 s just on a basic fitness application.  You and me both. I was out of all social media for quite a while and it was a really nice reset. I got back in with Reddit but mostly just browsed around looking at dumb pictures for a while. I finally got a Facebook again but I don t have it on my phone and I only access it at work because it s for marketing purposes only. I suppose I had a LinkedIn during that period but I seldom use it and it s kind of a different thing anyway. I periodically consider cutting all of them off my phone as a means to keep it from being too much of a thing for me and sometimes I do for a weekend or a few days if I feel like it s getting too pervasive or controlling for me. Essentially  once you understand it and you decide to control it by stepping away for a long enough period  you can do alright. But I ll admit  if it wasn t as socially pervasive  I would prefer we just do away with it altogether as a society. It s not really a positive for any aspect of society.   quot Do you know smoking is bad for you...  quot   Exactly this as well from both my own and my fiance  39 s families. Young adults have known this for a while  and have been blowing the whistle for just as long.

Another good one is  The Plot against the President  This one shows the lefts bias against Trump from before he took office  with a rant from Pelosi.  Social Media usage has a good running line with increase in social mental illness.  Very true  But the reality is you can  39 t engage in politics without social media. It is the equivalent if trying to campaign with one arm tied behind your back. There are millions on those platforms  and they are incredibly slanted along with mainstream media.  Campaigning   What s that    When you have both traditional and social media do it for you  you don  39 t need to   more like  quot it doesn  39 t matter who votes  it matters who counts the votes quot   Despite any possible voter irregularities  Biden would have won at least the popular vote. Entirely because of his overwhelming media support.  Hey Joey my guy  how s the red  He had COVID going for him... I think if it weren t for that and had he actually campaigned  none of this would have ever worked out.  Yeah. COVID pretty much destroyed our country.  He had the media do the campaigning for him  We finally found out how to get money out of politics  rig the elections  We ve come full circle  because social media is the literal equivalent of the printed pamphlets and newsletters that the colonists used to debate the political situation with England Pre Revolutionary War.   The harder and firmer the tech firms apply pressure  the more they solidify the resolve against them.  They are literally painting targets on themselves.  Britain also had this standing policy of bringing up on sedition charges such writers  hence why Benjamin Franklin wrote under a pseudonym.  Not quite. Yes  it is used for that purpose  but printed pamphlets  papers  and the like still exist and people hand those out in many places  college campuses  churches  schools  rallies  etc.  I know. I  39 ve even said that in other comments. Honestly I just miss the days before social media existed  No  quot maybe quot  about it. Social media is the worst thing ever invented  and I  39 m not being hyperbolic.  It was designed to bring people together  but it  39 s mostly just driven people away.  Once politics got involved it went to shit  I argue that politics were there from the get go  just people tended to ignore it. Now it  39 s like someone that jumped on your table at Applebees and shoved their junk in your face  you can  39 t ignore it.  That  39 s an oddly specific scenerio  MySpace was fun and politics free for the most part  plus scantily clad chicks were the norm  MySpace was mostly for high schoolers. I don t remember it ever getting big enough to include senators and world leaders...  Same here.  Does Reddit count as social media   I think so but it  39 s mostly anonymous so it  39 s a bit different  Social media is genuinely damaging society. Between division and depression and other things as well  it can  39 t be overstated just how negatively it has impacted this country  I dream of the day we humans realize our brains were not meant to be bombarded with these amount of information 24 7 especially without training or discipline.  Legit I m thinking about going back to a flip phone. No news is good news.     Quill and parchment paper like our founding fathers    We could go down to the local tavern and discuss and write down our thoughts. Alcohol is good in that it lowers your inhibitions and you will say what is truly on your mind. Not just what people want to hear.  Covid rules bans in person meetings  I think there is enough bars in peoples homes to get past that. New era of speakeasies  I  39 d get rid of facebook  but I.. have so many people I keep in contact with through there.  Imagine a national letter to the editor writing campaign where there  39 s an organized series of submitted articles to local papers across the country.  All engaging in non toxic  non hostile discussion of political news.  Return to letters  Or using couriers  Just like in the old days  when we had to photograph our meal  develop the photo  then take it to our friends houses one after another to show them.  Can t stop the signal  Mal.  To their credit  Parler has been getting a lot better  I never use Twitter either. It  39 s for Twits  as far as I  39 m concerned. We need our own  and Parler needs support now.  Twitter spokeswoman claimed that tweets from the Iranian leader   where he has publicly called for the  elimination  of Israel   amounted to little more than  foreign policy saber rattling.   The look on the twitter spokesperson face when she was asked why declaring genocide on Twitter was OK.  The level of this kind of shit from the media  Twitter  etc. over the past few years is just insane  but not at all surprising anymore.  They have lost 100  of their credibility  and it s hard to understand how they and others don t see it.  To everyone who ever called Trump a dictator  a dictator can  39 t be censored.  The one doing the censoring is the dictator.  Yeah.  Those claims were clearly ridiculous.  If you are getting pushed back from all the establishment  you are probably doing something right for the people  Oh c  39 mon  nobody cares about anti Semitic views. The left has proven they don  39 t care about the Jewish community.  And don t forget about Asians     I just love it how poor Asians have been kicked out of the   39 POC  39  definition for their financial independence and academic achievements. Now it  39 s   39 BIPOC  39  apparently.  That s because  success  is being re defined as  racist.    Now now now.  Not just don t care  they hate Jews bc they subvert the oppressed minority stereotype their worldview is built around.  They love secular Jews though because they are a 100  reliable voting block.  I m the smallest minority I know  a secular Jew that despises the left.  Watch your back  brother.  It  39 s not like Iran has killed any Israeli citizens or anything.  s  The left wouldn t mind the destruction of Israel. You can find tons of redditors calling Israel the same disgusting words such as  cancerous growth  the ayatollah uses.  Yeah that  39 s ridiculous  Vijaya s at it again  Currently watching the JRE podcast with her  tim pool  and Jack Dorsey. She is an absolute joke of a human.  Vijaya  we have to look at the context  Gadje.  Have not seen contortions like that since the Exorcist  Twitter allowed ISIS to use their platform to promote their ideology and recruit for years  they  are not operating in good faith.  Do you remember when Maxine Waters literally told people tobopenly harass any Republican lawmakers that they saw dining in public and all that and that wasn  39 t considered any kind of problem   Vividly  Yes. I  39 m old enough to remember a year ago.  Social media was a mistake. Across the board. I think we will see a reversal of technology in the coming years  Social media as a tool to keep up with family is great. I don  39 t have to send individual messages  or bulk emails  I just post shit to my wall. I can message people using apps without ever giving out my phone number. It serves a good purpose.  Yes but social media also is fake and feels fake and lazy.   2024 raises the spectre of having a candidate banned from all forms of social media running against one endorsed by it.  Doubtful. Kids today grew up with it. They wouldn  39 t know how to or even want to function without it.  Twitter is a joke and this excuse makes them look even worse. Just say  quot we don  39 t like Trump and what he represents  so we decided to take him off our platform. quot   Isn t that the country that hung hundreds of protesters on cranes   I think I ve honestly just got some clarity  big tech and whoever else is entangled with them is literally trying to incite more anger and resentment from Conservatives  the Capitol incident was their perfect excuse  and now they can do whatever they want and use the conservative outraged reactions to justify more censorship further and further.  They ve been waiting for four years for the right to finally cave in and say  you know what... it looks like the only thing you ll pay attention to is a riot...  and do exactly what they ve been encouraging leftists to do. The  em second  em  that the left s insanity was even sort of matched  they used it as an excuse to label right wing rioters as terrorists. They didn t even get a chance to be  peaceful protestors  because they were labeled as violent Nazis the second they stated their intent to protest. They skipped right over  rioters  as well and went straight to  domestic terrorists.  The consequences for terrorism are a  em lot  em  worse than rioting  and certainly worse than the ones our favorite little peaceful protesters received. To put things in perspective  we were calling for arrests and prosecutions for the destruction of people s private property by people involved in BLM riots. People on the left are calling for the rioters in the Capitol to be declared a terrorist  stripped of their citizenship  and be tried for treason  remember what the penalty for treason is  anyone  . They want resistance to be punishable by death. It won t be long until it moves from censorship to mass murder. Stay safe. They re scared now  and they re going to do whatever it takes to maintain the power they ve grabbed  and they certainly have no problems with disposing of you if you threaten that in any capacity.  Also note that if a leftist  quot protester quot  is carrying an AR15  the media calls it  quot a long gun quot . If a conservative carries it even while hunting game in the woods  let alone at a protest   the media calls it  quot an assault rifle. quot   You want to know how truly nuts they are   Last year I had a couple people tell me that the American flag was essentially a sign of white supremacy or some shit.  I wanted to tell them how pathetic they were  but I kept it to myself.  There  39 s no reasoning with people who think that.  Yeah  that s what I figured.  Find me a country that has never done anything bad  and I will move there immediately. Until then  I know of nowhere else better to live than the US.  Right  everyone does bad stuff.  So what   Our goals and values are good  and that is what the flag stands for.  Just removed Twitter and cash app from my phone. Not using them is  the least I can do.   deleted   Jack Dorsey is the CEO of both Twitter and Square  which owns Cash App.   deleted   I don t give a shit anymore. We had almost 3 decades of shit presidents before him and probably all the rest during my life will be shit. Social media is cancer and has placed this country under mob rule   quot BuT iTz A pRiVaTe CoMpAnY LaWlZ quot    the left  suddenly taking the side of that baker who didn  39 t want to make gay wedding cakes.  Can someone explain how they are still protected under 230 with this blatant selective enforcement  It s an obvious publisher move.  Take away 230. It would solve a lot of problems IMO.  Never happen now. Democrats control everything and social media is in their corner.  230 will not be taken away or enforced the way it s supposed to be by Dems in exchange for big tech censoring opposition.  Just deactivated my Twitter account and deleted the App. Don t need it anymore.  Same here.  Not to mention that recent genocidal tweet by China  Not only this. After the recent beheading of that teacher in France  many muslim world leaders called for killing of French people and the president on social media. Those tweets weren  39 t even flagged.  Which Muslim world leaders   Death to America good. America First bad. What lunacy.  I am not American but this really infuriates me. This is not the America I grew up to respect. The fact that the left runs big tech and gets away with promoting BLM riots while banning Trump  blocking conservatives and bringing down Parler. Jeez  you guys should storm the capital or something.  Hahaha. I absolutely love foreigners who get what we are dealing with.     The bias wouldn  39 t be as troubling if we weren  39 t being gaslit and told there is no bias.  I can handle it if the bias is there in the open.    Maybe this will ultimately lead to something I didn t think would ever happen  the end of social media.  Way down the road  maybe after our time.  I think it s a good thing in that sense  but fuck this attempted censorship of the Right.  There is no defense  Twitter is a leftist propaganda publisher and should be treated as such.  Stop using Twitter.  People that use Twitter after this are complete suckers  Fuck Twitter. Walk away.  They should both be permitted. Both are saber rattling at most.  Deactivated my Twitter account today. Not looking back  In the post constitutional  Orwellian USA this will make sense to people.   em ruLES fOR thEE buT nOT ayaTOLLaH khaMENei  em   How anyone could support the democrat or the mainstream media after their neverending hypocrisy the last 4 years. The hilarity of calling what happened at the capital last week a  riot  yet when blm and Antifa literally tried to burn down multiple federal buildings among all the other violent crime they committed  that was called a  mostly peaceful protest   Makes sense. After the antisemitic comments the DNC made about Bernie Sanders  it seems that they agree with Khamenei on a great many things.  I walked away from fascistbook when they started heavily censoring conservatives. Am walking away from twatter for the same reason.  Will walk from here if they push the issue.  They need me more than I need them I can assure you.  not surprising they  39 d offer some half baked defense of their blatant partisanship. the last month or so should have made it pretty clear that twitter had it out for him and was merely preparing their excuses.  Social media is a joke and always will be. Makes me mad but not surprised. They  39 re scum.  They literally banned trump because he said he wasnt attending bidens inauguration  Of course they do  fkkin hypocrites  This is what I don  39 t get.  There is a zero percent chance that Donald Trump posts his own tweets.  100  is Dan Scavino  Hope Hicks  and the rest of the social media  amp  communications teams.  Just like Katie Dowd and her team manages Hillary Clinton  39 s social media platforms  and Rob Flaherty for Joe Biden.    Fuck TWATTER   They should do both.  Things like this confirm that having never been interested in the Twitter sphere was the right choice for me. These are adolescent mentality adults running tech companies and exerting their power where they can  which is sadly misplaced. It  39 s about one thing   quot Get into line with our views or you  39 re no longer on our site. quot  Grow up.  And people act surprised that so many marched on the capitol the other day. Shit like this over the past few years has built up and people have had enough.  For the past year  people have been burning down entire city blocks with media and politicians making excuses to justify it. Same media and politicians that for three years was filling everyone  39 s head that the last election was stolen  planting the seeds of distrust towards the election system. Now they pretend to be appalled... The irony....  Muslim good America bad  NO. SHIT.  Or Venezuela s Maduro....  Pointing out their hypocrisy is stupid  they know that they don t have consistent standards no shit. This isn t about vague inconsistent rules or whatever  it s just about them shutting down certain political viewpoints and using some random line as a weak cover  Biden police state technocracy incoming. be ready.  Ugh what kind of mental gymnastics are they doing to justify this  I wonder   The timing of the ban of parler and Trumps Twitter ban is very suspicious.

The fact that any liberal allied intern was let anywhere near the State Department  let alone inside it  is a quintessential illustration of the failure of this administration to adequately put down the leftists insurgents  Some liberal intern editing the web page.

You see the thing is  the left has no opposition  every  opposition voice has been or will be silenced. There is no incentive for Biden  39 s administration to not roll back and cut ties all together. I  39 m curious to see the outcome and I  39 m hopeful that you  39 re right.

t3_ku3sx5,Parler reportedly removed posts by Trump affiliate Lin Wood,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku3sx5/parler_reportedly_removed_posts_by_trump/,Around the second or third time Sidney Powell said the word kraken I stopped paying attention to the Trump orbit so I m not entirely sure who this Lin Wood cat is  but he seems insane  Yeah I quickly looked at them in a religious perspective. I m agnostic but if Jesus comes down on a cloud one day  I m gonna say  I stand corrected   I m in    Their allegations I m like  I want this to be true cause it s honestly believable and would helped but I m tuning you out until you show me something .   The dude is a lunatic.  That s an understatement  Yup.  i can t believe anyone listens to the shit lin spews out  He s been right about nearly everything though...  He  39 s been right about nothing  but he has called for the execution of Mike Pence and others. He keeps saying he has tapes of Justice Roberts and other elites raping and killing children  ut he won  39 t release until the time is right.  He is a lunatic  and contributed greatly to our loss in Georgia  people should not listen to him. However I wouldn t put anything past the elite.  Not saying you should blindly believe him  but would you be surprised if certain elites were the scum of the earth   I  39 m sure some are  but if Lin Wood says someone is  I  39 m more likely to believe they aren  39 t than I was before.  He knew about loeffler  proved pence has been trying to undermine trump  he tells it like it is. I do agree he shouldn t have tried to undermine the Georgia election  but I also can t blame someone for not wanting to vote in a rigged election. I know I won t be voting again.  He also said Trump was going to use the insurrection act and pretty much has made every outlandish claim you could think of.  This is true.  Umm I follow Lin for awhile on Twitter and now Parler  I don  39 t seem to recall anything like that. I disagree with plenty he says ofc.   a href  https   fellowshipoftheminds.com wp content uploads 2021 01 Lin Wood2.jpg  https   fellowshipoftheminds.com wp content uploads 2021 01 Lin Wood2.jpg  a   I don  39 t know why that  39 s getting dv. Lin Sidney and Flynn are really radical  but they were talking about things months before they came out in the open.  They say things that are very outlandish  and take backlash from everyone saying they  39 re crazy.  Then it turns out to be true.  Funny how that works.  Everyone said Powell was crazy to say what she did about Dominion and votes being switched back in early November. Look where we are now.  You may have to elaborate as some stuff as admittedly been a little our there. However I  39 m happy to be wrong if that  39 s the cause  Good.

I think you  39 re at least correct ish  though when there were calls for riots and killing white and rich people over the summer we were told that incitement requires a call to action at a specific place and time.  Perhaps that has changed again.  He s an absolute head case tbf  The guy started out as a high profile attorney and now has reduced himself to a crackpot.  What I gather from this is that Parler indeed has limits. Apple and Google would have you believe that they have no enforcement whatsoever. I would like to think that this shows that Parler will intervene IF CLEAR LINES ARE CROSSED.  I m a little lost here. Who is this guy and what has he done   Q anon  It sounds like the Parlor ToS are a bit more explicit about how parlays conveying violence are handled. Though j think people like Wood should work harder to not use language that can be so misconstrued and twisted as to result in ToS violations. Just use some different language to convey your otherwise on point messaging.  I mean  let  39 s be honest  his message was clear as day.  Appeasing the Looney Liberals achieves nothing but a short lived moment of quiet
t3_ktytc9,Dems to introduce article of impeachment against Trump on Monday,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ktytc9/dems_to_introduce_article_of_impeachment_against/,Both parties are afraid of Trump running in 2024.  Aren  39 t there more important things to focus on  Biden  39 s inauguration is January 20th.  Let it go   and let  39 s get something done on DC.    I  39 ve been reading that they want to shove this through before some executive order that Trump may put through before he leaves  possibly with declassifying everything  which has many dims awfully nervous.  Potentially not only dims sweating a bit.  John Roberts comes to mind.  Why was this downvoted   Because the leftists refuse to let conservatives even have a place to share thoughts with one another  so they  39 re brigading like never before.  Weak minded folks who  39 d rather silence dissenting views  rather than debate said views.  Squeeze out the very last drops  Dude  they  39 ll be using that shit for the next 4 years or so. Any little bad thing that happens will be  quot Trump  39 s fault  He caused this when he was in office. quot  Nothing will be Bidens or the Dems fault. But bet your ass anything good that happened during Trump  39 s term they will take credit for and make sure everyone knows how they  39 re basically superheros.  Tbh  i don t want him to run 2024  he is too old then and can t shut his mouth. I would like DeSanctis and Noem as a duo  or Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley running for 2024. No RINOs anymore  they should go to irrelevancy.  Cruz Hawley is a guaranteed loss come on now  This probably has more to do with Republicans in the House. This seems like a  quot you  39 re either with us or against us quot  kind of thing and they want it on the record.  As dumb as that sounds...it s all about  the moral high ground  not what s best for this country during COVID  I feel like letting him just fade out would be a more effective strategy  instead they just keep him relevant by pissing off his base.  His base is going nowhere regardless. This i guarantee.  Trump is now the GOP king maker if the GOP pulls their head out of their ass and rallies around a Trump backed candidate that fights to MAGA. If not  Trump gets to piss all over both parties and fund tech and media companies that compete directly with the establishment.  I sincerely hope he dedicates part of the remainder of his life to unraveling the unbelievably corrupt media system in this country.  Hopefully Musk is on our side as well.  He ll lose benefits including paid travel and secret service detail if he s impeached  the left wants him to suffer at all costs  Well you re wrong he can be impeached in the house if he s not convicted in the Senate it s a irrelevant.  Remember he s already been impeached  He was already impeached. Impeached and removed are two separate issues  one in the house  one made final in the senate. So if the GOP wants to give Democrats a super majority in the senate they won  39 t allow more than a few Romney type Republicans to cross the line to fail in the Senate vote. Mitch apparently won  39 t even take it up a vote  he  39 s still thr majority leader in the senate until Biden is sworn in. Democrats can vote when they have the majority  they still need more than a simple majority in the senate to finalize an impeachment.  I love how they think taking paid travel away from Trump will impact his life in any significant way.   If they impeach and convict him he can t run in 2024. That s the real goal.  I hope he doesn t run in 2024 tbh  He  39 ll be 80 by then  I don  39 t think he will plan on running.  78  He  39 s too old  and as much as I  39 ve liked him he will only bring back angry and divisive thoughts from 2020. I hope the GOP goes the direction he  39 s shoved it in  but I  39 d like to see him call it a day and comment on it instead of muddying up the 2024 primaries.  Why  He stands the best chance at winning by far.  He  39 d be 78 in 2024. I  39 m not comfortable having someone that old in the office. I already heavily doubt Biden will even finish out his term.  Sure  but the guy is divisive as shit and he ll be 82      I don t want him at that age in office  we sit here and call Biden too old but cheer on Trump in 2024. This guy has no place in office anymore. I liked a lot of his stances but I m done with him after this year. If 2020 never happened he d be back in office but this year he shat his place in history so hard. I m ready for someone to come in and lead in a more presidential way. I don t want Ted Cruz either. He s a blow hard.  He would be 78 not 82. He would be the same age as biden now  My apologies  got my ages mixed up  I ve voted for him twice  and would likely do it a third time  and I do agree with you  but I think occasionally he runs his mouth and it benefits the democrats and hurts the Republican party  It  39 s cute they think America will be in a position to hold an election in 2024.  He will still have secret service lmao   They re delusional. Nixon still had it after watergate   Bush is a war criminal and he s still got it.  Trump will always have it from now until the day he dies.  They can kiss their false hopes goodbye  Well Nixon resigned. He wasn t removed.  Nixon didn  39 t actually get impeached tho  he resigned  Wouldn  39 t be allowed to run upon a conviction that explicitly prohibits it.  Curious... As if they  39 re doing it to remove his security detail in hopes he is assassinated.  No need for curiosity  I d bet that a majority of leftists would jump for joy if he was assassinated  They would dance in the streets.  Then tell everybody else to stay inside forever and social distance.  And be celebrated on social media without censorship...  Is that true  Every past United States president is provided in secret service for security purposes. They all have knowledge of the government and its highest levels and must be protected. They can  39 t just take it away.  Makes no sense. He s been impeached so was Bill Clinton. Even if he s Removed from office I think they give it to him. That s a bullshit narrative they re running   Nixon had and then said he didn t want them anymore after the watergate bullshit.  They re not gonna allow Trump without secret service  especially him out of all presidents lmao  See  a normal human would agree with you  but this is the left we re talking about  they want blood and retribution  an impeachment would also stop him from hypothetically running in 2024  which I guarantee they are afraid of  Yes that s what they re more worried about.   Senate Republicans won t proceed cause they will lose even more of their own voter base but Trump out of all former presidents will likely even have more agents by his side. If he decides let s say to go to New York to his tower for a week. That s on fifth avenue with all these people around. They ll be protecting other innocent people as well. Mar a Lago has people that go there in Palm Beach  all the elites live so both parties would worry  they re not taking the chance for innocent people to be harmed too. It s more than just protecting him in this situation.  He can pay for his own private detail but secret service is just way better. They won t be able to strip him of it.  I think this is more pile on. The Democrats are so angry  probably because all through his presidency he out played them   they want to humiliate him. They want blood his and his supporters. They want to destroy him and his supporters. This is about hate.  hate and logic are inversely proportional.  if he is impeached AND convicted.  If true and they succeeded in removing his secret service details  they  39 ll ramp up  even more  the rhetoric against him. Then wait and hope someone goes after him.  They don  39 t want him to run in 2024.  Can confirm. I m enraged. More at Republicans letting this happen. Still enraged.  You  39 re assuming that Democrats are happy with the current amount of power that they  39 re going to receive  but they aren  39 t. The past few days have been one of the most blatant power grabs in US history. This is something that isn  39 t supposed to happen here  but it is  This goes to show the continuous mental health issues Democrat politicians have. It  39 s impossible to start and finish an impeachment before he leaves office.  The only reason they want to impeach Trump a second time is so he goes down in the history books as a failed president  being impeached twice. It s so future generations know the  horrible  presidency of Trump and conservatism.  Yeah they  39 re trying to do their best to cook the books as much as they can. I  39 m interested to see what my 2 year olds are going to learn about him in high school US history  even if I can provide them better than public school.  Democrats need to remember almost half of all voters who voted  voted for him.  Russemen polling shows Trump UP since Jan 6th.  They do but they don  39 t care. They  39 re staunch believers in the tyranny of the majority.  Yeah exactly. If they could make it so only NYC  LA and Chicago could vote  they would.  Mcconnell has already said he  39 s not even going to look at this until after Trump is already out of office.  Clearly this is all political theater.  What I can  39 t get my head around is why they are bothering to stage the play.  It  39 s certainly not going to help solve anything.   Is there really any political advantage to doing this   They are about to have FULL control. If they pack the SCOTUS even more so. That have nothing to lose by trying to rile us up more and by appeasing their ravenous dogs.  Republicans need to draft articles of impeachment against Biden and his ties to China.  They wont because they  39 re a bunch of fucking pussies.  You want Harris to be president   The Dems would jump on the opportunity   A harris presidency would be a disaster for the Dems. No one likes her  The progressives would love it  The progressives didn  39 t get out to vote for her  and their insane radicalism turns off moderates. Biden won the nomination for a reason  he was the least radical one on the stage  They didn t vote for kamala because they preferred other radicals like Bernie and Warren  but Kamala is still much closer to their beliefs than Biden will ever be. Leftists act like they got a victory cause Trump is out  but the sad reality is that Biden was the last thing they wanted.  Thats why i think the two party system has failed. Democrats with their current leadership can t satisfy progressives  while GOP is failing to represent right wingers. I think a multi party system should be coming.  LOL....I think Harris will let  quot nature run its course quot  for about 6 months. I got a shiny new nickle says she  39 s The Boss by Sept 1st   What exactly are his ties to China  The laptop thing    removed   Part of me thinks they  39 re only doing this to keep the MSM and Lefties looking in one direction.   I used to call them the MSM as well  I think a more fitting name is the democrat media establishment  The DME. I like it.  So I asked about this a wile back in a flare only post and got an answer from  a href   u callmesalticidae  u callmesalticidae  a  in my DM.  In this case  I feel it  39 s more symbolic. I don  39 t believe they  39 ll be able to get the 2 3 vote to convict anyway.  The reason for impeachment is to prevent Trump from being able to run for President in 2024.   Thank the good Lord they  39 re not wasting time on those pesky COVID19 relief bills anymore. Maybe some of the Americans who  39 ve lost jobs and livelihoods can just eat the articles of impeachment  or burn them to keep warm.  They  39 re scared. Trump and his base has only grown stronger.  And angrier   removed   Be prepared for false flags and distractions.  I  39 m starting to wonder if the intention is to goad us to the point they think they can declare martial law.  I  39 m really curious how the top brass feel about all this. I know your average enlisted soldier leans right.  So glad we are wasting tax payer dollars on this.  s  Hate filled to the end. Typical of fascists.  What a bunch of petty scumbags.  okay but why are they even doing this if he isn  39 t being re elected  It makes no sense whatsoever  They had their chance but laid down after Trump committed a war crime by assassinating Soleimani.  7th time s the charm  I can t even watch the news anymore    Now he s going scorched earth...  Waste of time and money but OK...  They couldn  39 t wait until the 20th for Trump  39 s presidency to end 
t3_ku7ri3,The Great Purge Expands As CNN Sets Its Sights On Fox News Cable Providers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku7ri3/the_great_purge_expands_as_cnn_sets_its_sights_on/,Funny  Fox made their bed and now their  base  won t fight for them when this happens. I m more concerned about Parler than the faux mainstream media wars.  True  but I m worried about people like tucker and hannity.   deleted   I do like Watters and specially his watters world segment  Tucker is the only one I actually enjoy listening to on Fox.  Don t be this childish. Fox is still way better than any left media. It would be a big loss for us if we lose Fox.   Fox made their bed. Now they can lay in it.  I understand many people are angry at Fox. The way we have acted has been very short sighted. The anger is wreaking us. The left is laughing at our infighting. If Fox is gone  we wouldn t even have partial representation in MSM. Our voice would be sidelined even more. How is it good for the right   This how the RINOs stay in power   by FUD arguments. The 75M people who voted for Trump aren t going to change their minds. The good news anchors at Fox aren t going away. Kill Fox and support other conservative orgs. If one is gone the others will rise.  RINOs stay in power because we didn t fight enough in the primaries. We need to have more people to run for offices.   This is temporary and we will eventually come out strong. I don  39 t see how we can get stronger without ridding of all the RINOs.  Forreal  why is everyone so mad at fox   Because they called Arizona super early   Chris Wallace s moderation of one of the debates was the last straw for me.  Remember when Democrats at least pretended to support freedom of speech   Even pretending  actually hasnt been for quite a long time.  For all the moderates and the liberals   So I logged on looking for help  and was unable to speak.  Maybe Fox news should play the riots in CNN  39 s lobby on a loop.  May as well go out with a bang  CNN is committing suicide here   they wont exist when this is all over.  The whole  quot far left narrative quot  business model only worked as long as trump was in. I predict immediate dropoff in ratings  No  its going to step up to cover for the Atrocities that biden amp co are going to perpetrate.  That might not be a bad thing. Good riddance CNN. And to think I used to think it was the more balanced one of the three.  They can silence the voice all they want. Eventually  it will just be people walking around  silently resenting and hating them. They will have no conservative views to be outraged about  because they won t be present anywhere. When they need to feed their anger addiction  and there are no conservatives to direct that anger to  they ll start turning on each other worse than we ve seen them do already.   Let Fox fight by themselves. Don t help them.  If you need any more evidence that this purge was premeditated  look at Fox s massive  self destructive swing to centre as proof that they were planning to avoid the banwave from at least six months ago.  Are they trying to accelerate cord cutting   FOX showed its true colors during the election  so it really doesn t bother me if they get censored  The murdoch  39 s celebrated when Biden was elected  let their precious news station and the wealth disappear. No love lost here.  Pulling the plug on Fox News would be the best scenario possible for us.  No   having CNN  39 s pulled would be actually better   one less lying propaganda mill helping America  39 s enemies  Fox can go for all I care  When I saw the riots at the Capitol I tried to turn on Fox News  it was the only channel on Comcast XFinity that was not working. Didn t have access to it all day. Worked fine on Thursday  then when news broke about Trump being kicked off Twitter permanently  again no access to Fox News. I m not a big believer in conspiracies  but now I m starting to wonder.  strange that that happened.  Not that I ever saw  Lets see what the leftists will do in their hatred to everything that wont kowtow to them.

t3_ku137k,Pompeo Calls Twitters Ban on Trump UnAmerican Compares It to Chinese Communist Censorship,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ku137k/pompeo_calls_twitters_ban_on_trump_unamerican/,Ironic since Twitter won  39 t censor Chinese communist leaders  Obviously their crowing about freeing Uighur women from being baby factories by forced sterilization is just saber rattling  duh.  Break up FB and Twitter  Let  39 s see who has the last laugh.  They can either be   The issue is that they  39 re claiming they  39 re removing illegal activity when it  39 s not illegal. They  39 ll claim they  39 re acting within the ACT 230 regulations  I mean it is a commie censoring it. But instead of Chinese it s a squirrelly little fuck who got bullied as a kid and is taking it out on republicans  They  39 ll ban him next for saying that.  It  39 s definitely getting there. Soon everyone will need to use a VPN.  How would a VPN have helped in Trump  39 s case    deleted   Guess we leave our phones at home and meet in person.  Remember those days   That  39 s the last thing they should want. Time to oil up the hand crank printing press.  Hey zines could make a comeback.  Conservatism is the new underground counter culture  I d love to see some riot grrl patches haha. Though conservative punk probably won t look like regular punk.  I have some horses  who wants to restart the Pony Express   Tails   TOR will make you pretty untraceable.  It  39 s not though  in China the government tells the company what to do. Here it was Trump breaking Twitter  39 s TOS.  Bullshit  he literally said to be peaceful.  They didn  39 t delete that video in time for people not to catch it.  Always makes me laugh.  Breaking their  quot TOS quot   Well if things really run amuck we may find out first hand.  Why would China care if people are purchasing things  They care about power  not money.  Nothing was mentioned about China  I am referring to car insurance or food or merchants that advertise there.  Facebook and twitter are Chinese puppets. Do you really think they aren  39 t aware that Twitter will go bankrupt without trump  Money is not important to them.  Because it is.  Keep at it Dems. Keep it going. Show the world what you re really about.  Wishing to jail a journalist for publishing whistle blower material is also un American but he still wants to go after Assange.
